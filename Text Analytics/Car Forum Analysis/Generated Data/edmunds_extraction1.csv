"markcincinnati","September 2007"," I do like the CTS, I will certainly consider one in early 2008, assuming they (GM) offer discounts and subvented leases as they have done time and again.At the MSRP ""as I would configure"" the CTS, it is a fine car but -- other than fit and finish and its styling -- it ""seems to be as current as many of the other guys were putting out in the second half of 2004.""For a typical second or third quarter GM discount, however, it will be attractive even to someone like me who thinks it is not exactly leading edge (although the DI engine seems very fine, indeed.)On the issue of voice activation -- I have a current gen Audi A6. It has 82 buttons, knobs, switches, dials, gauges and/or controls (not including my phone.) I have the in-armrest mounted phone dock AND the thing has bluetooth. I rarely, due to the the in armrest cradle, activate bluetooth -- but I use the voice control for the audio, nav and telephone system -- almost literally every time I get into the car.I consider it a safety feature.Were a vote be presented to the voters of the US, I would, uncharacteristically, vote to ban the use of a cell phone in a car that was not entirely voice controlled (hand and eyes free.)When I am driving, I often look at the other drivers on the road; I see the majority of them on the phone (driving with one hand and I assume one eye on the road and controls.)Much as I want ""you"" to have the personal freedom to kill yourself by using a phone while driving (if that is your goal), I just don't want to be on the highway with you.Much as I want (well, maybe) more knobs and buttons and dials and gizmos to be confronting me whilst I am behind the wheel, it is getting to the point that it is distracting to change the channel (and find other controls in the sea of buttons) without voice command.My wife's 2005 BMW does not need voice command. The new CTS is populated with buttons, dials, rotary switches -- a virtual maze of controls. Just tell your car what you want it to do, or ""pull over"" -- folks don't want to pull over and voice command is becoming (or in the case of the Germans, already has become) a virtual safety option.At age 56, I may be a yuppie.

"sevenfeet0","September 2007"," Agreed. This forum is supposed to be about things that most of us enjoy as a passtime, or certainly a drivetime. Manufacturers compete for our dollars fiercely in this space and like most things concerning marketing, most of us are conditioned to preferences after a while, even decending into ""fanboyism"". I admit it, I have preferences with certain brands over others. But I want all of them to deliver the best product possible since it's impossible for the products from one brand to satisfy everyone. After all, if everyone just bought ""your favorite brand"", it would be a pretty boring place.Regarding the two brands at issue here, Cadillac has been going down this ""Europeanism"" trend for a long time before the CTS, often with lousy results. I can remember the 1976 Seville, the 1982 Cimarron, the 1989 Allante and the 1997 Catera as examples. Cadillac has had the unenvyable position of trying to rewrite their DNA for decades now, which isn't easy. Even with Bob Lutz at the helm, a former GM engine manager once told me that GM's corporate culture doesn't do much to reward risk...in fact, the company (and especially Cadillac) got very risk averse over the last 30 years. Witness the 1981 V8-6-4 engine failure, the 1982 Cimarron, the 1989 Allante and Catera projects all made Caddy very adverse making the product decisions they need to make.Constrast that with BMW. The BMW we all know really got off the ground in the early '70s with the first 2002s. Originally in the shadow of Mercedes and Audi, they made their mark with great handling sedans and coupes that were contrary to what most American buyers were used to seeing. Were all these products successful? Not a chance. The 320 program of the early '80s (especially the 320e) weren't home run hits. The 12-cylinder 850s lanquished on dealer lots and recent models were fiercely criticized for Bangle styling and iDrive. But the path to where BMW is now has been fairly straightforward to the point where they command many of the segments they compete in.In business, it's interesting to watch the players that do most everything right but its far more fun and educational to see the ones that were once powerful fall from grace and claw themselves back to relevance. Apple Computer is a classic example. Cadillac is trying to do the same thing (against bigger odds in my opinion). What happens next? Who knows? But the marketplace will decide. "

And I will admit I always considered the E36/46 were to small for my tastes predominantly because I was used to U.S. market fare. I believed the Buy America was the way to go until it made little sense at the end of the day. I was surprised at the weight of my 330 considering the compact designation, however. I guess BMW compromised from the original design strategy. But the suspension still is to die for. I could care less for the perceived image factor. You could slice off the roundel and it would still be in my garage.I agree it is fun to see what the ""Hurtin' Three"" will do to put the train back on the tracks. The Camaro and Challenger coming back from the dead will be interesting. For GM, Cadillac needs a heck of a lot more work to do. Buick/Pontiac is on life support and the prognosis is NOT good.

"markcincinnati","September 2007"," If it were only that easy, that simple.My concern is that the unions (among other things) may slowly force GM out of biz. The talking heads claim the union is on strike for ""job security.""  :confuse: It appears the actions being taken may actually have the opposite effect -- at least that seems to be one of the outcomes that COULD happen.Here in Cincinnati, where the Camaro used to be produced, the GM union workers went on strike and kept squeezing and squeezing GM. GM responded by saying, ""if you keep doing this, we'll have to shut the plant down here in Norwood.""Then ""all of a sudden"" GM says, ""we can't make a go of it here anymore"" -- and ""all of a sudden"" the union, in response, threatened productivity.Too little, too late.This account is a summary, is incomplete and is somewhat light on the facts, since it was certainly NOT solely the union that killed GM here in Cincinnati (Hamilton, Oh and Norwood, Oh.)The point is, with over $1,500 in ""burden"" per car produced, we should not be surprised to see cars made by companies that have a ""comparative advantage."" "
"habitat1","September 2007"," I saw a report on CNBC this morning indicating that GM's labor costs are, on the average $30 to $40 per hour HIGHER than their competitors at Toyota and Honda, when you factor in all of the fringe benefits, health care costs, etc.Now I don't mean to sound elitist, but I find it excessive that the average autoworker would even MAKE $30 to $40 per hour, with benefits. The vast majority of these assembly line and plant jobs do not require a college education and are nominally more ""skilled"" than the average service worker. It's nice to think that somebody with a high school education can punch a clock for 40 hours per week, have 4-5 weeks of vacation a year, and make the equivalent of $120-150,000+ per year ($60k-$80k more than their Toyota counterparts).

"blueguydotcom","September 2007"," You don't sound like an elitist. It makes sense that people with specialized schooling and industry-specific knowledge should be compensated more than someone who must tighten bolts or check for gaps in paneling. I'm pretty confident that most people working in the automotive world could not step into my job on-the-fly and be up to speed in a week or two. Flipside, longshoremen and autoworkers are employed in what are traditionally considered blue collar jobs: little specific education to carry out the tasks and those tasks have become highly automated. "
"plekto","September 2007"," The problem is that the UAW's ""Job Security"" essentially ties GM's hands. They want to get rid of the entire Job Bank and many part-timers to lower costs, but the union won't budge.Unfortunately, for GM, it's trim the workforce or shut its doors in the U.S. and move overseas. Zero other options. So the UAW just effectively shot itself in the foot because GM is back against a wall with no way out.(and logically, as a result, no room to negotiate). They sucked and sucked and sucked at that teat until it just gave out.GM's best move at this point? Fire the entire UAW and hire the employees on their own terms(or hire new workers). They really have no other choice. Given how our economy is going downhill, I suspect most of the workers will give in sooner or later if it's a choice between accepting less money and having their car and house payments or having their pride. The rest they can hire.Now, I'm personally a supporter of MOST unions, but it's a give and take scenario. I've seen the UAW do noting but take for two decades or more and it's finally made GM decide that opting out is less painful than negotiating. I don't really blame them, either. "
"wardm","September 2007"," Plekto,I can't think of a single union that I am in favor of. I work for an organization that puts on trade shows for its constituents at various convention centers throughout the U.S.. We have to deal with the unions in most of those cities in order to set up our events. Productivity comes to a screeching halt because of the unions. We can't even move a box from one room to another without having a union person do it. And it's not like they come running when you need them.I recall when I was in high school in the Washington D.C. area I had a friend who worked as a cashier in a grocery store. He was making twice what I made at the local hardware store and got double time on Saturdays and triple time on Sundays and holidays. It was ridiculous.Around the same time frame, late 1970's, I new of a person who lived near my Aunt in Gadsden, Alabama who made $22.00 per hour sweeping floors at the local steel plant. That's over $45,000 in 1978!!! Unfortunately, the steel plant closed, probably because of having to pay ridiculous wages (and benefits).Unions are choking American industry. "

Oh sure Cadillac wouldn't mind some 3-seried buyers cross shopping since they don't have a car in that space (in America) and probably won't for another 2 years.

But Cadillac has already publically stated that the STS (and DTS) will die in favor of a new large flagship car, while a smaller ""B-series"" car will slot under the CTS in the next couple of years.Yes the CTS is on the heavy side and that's been a problem for GM's Sigma platform in general.

I fully expect GM to retify that situation when the next-gen Northstar appears in a year or two. With a new CTS-V also due on the horizon, that means the STS can be put out to pasture.

For example, the Mercedes E class, BMW 5 series both don't have enough room for my legs and knees. The Audi A6 is even worse. The Lexus GS doesn't have enough head room (the ES is better). The only CTS competitors I've driven that I fit into are the Infiniti M35 and the Acura RL.One of the reasons I liked the previous CTS was because it had enough leg room and knee room for me....barely enough, but it was enough. I was very afraid that the next generation car wasn't going to have enough room for me. Instead, I found that the front leg room and knee room was far better than the outgoing vehicle.So when you say that the CTS doesn't compete in ""usable space"", I would only say that I consider the extra room I get in the front seat versus the rear seat far more important for me concerning ""usable space"".

It's easy in a forum to end up doing the old ""Monty Python Argument Sketch"" in situations like this, especially when the debates often centers upon the objective and asthestic.For the recond, I've always thought that Audi made the best interiors in this space but since I can't fit in the driver's seat, it's pretty moot. BMW interiors to me are competent but too austere for me. The new CTS interior is light years ahead of the old one. Not perfect (what is?) but competetive. "
"sevenfeet0","September 2007"," The 535i is the same size but is 300 lbs lighter. Shrug.This is a poor rebuttle. My argument was that the CTS's measurements were within the parameters of the class. Weight was heavy, but still not the worst of the class.Then what's the hangup on a barge like a 5 or CTS? Seriously you just went on and on about epa space and then come back by saying it's not important to you. So what is important? If space isn't an issue, then why opt for a car of that size?When did I ever say that EPA space wasn't important to me? Please reread my post. I only used it to show the differentiation in the sizes of the vehicles. Everybody says the CTS is either better suited to compete against the BMW 3-series or is more of a ""tweener"" car in size. The measurements of this car say otherwise. You could successfully make that argument about the older car, but not this one.Huh? 5 series and 3 series both have 3.0 300 hp engines compared to the Caddy's 300 hp V6. Strangely, that 300 hp 6 in the 5 and 3 propels both cars with electrifying power. What exactly is wrong with GM's engine development? The weight can't be totally to blame for the slowness of the CTS.What I meant here was that virtually all the cars in this class (save Acura) offer both a V6 engine (sometimes two) and a V8 before getting to the ""hot-rod"" department. BMW has the 540i, Mercedes has the E550, and so on and so forth. Also, weight is a big factor in the performance of a vehicle but it's not the only factor. Available torque and where that torque is available on the RPM curve is very important. The CTS DI V6 has less torque than the 535i, and the CTS weighs more than the 535i. So noticing that the CTS is slower than the BMW isn't rocket science. Finally, gear ratios (transmission and final drive) are the third variable in the equation, but that's another discussion. "

The chassis is an update to the same Sigma chassis found in the old CTS, the STS and the SRX. That chassis is known for its strength and all around performance, but it's not the lightest design out there. Some automakers are putting more and more aluminum in their chassis designs but this is expensive and have implications for repair shops.

"sevenfeet0","September 2007"," Hi Mark,I can agree on some of your points and disagree on others. First, I do think the CTS is a member of the 5 series competitor club with the exception of the non-availability of V8 power. It has just about everything else. There are a few options sometimes found in this group (lane change avoidance) that are still only available on the STS, probably to keep some product seperation while that model goes on its long march to oblivion.And regarding Infiniti, ah yes, they do upset the ol' product line apple cart, don't they? The M35 is on the large size of the class, mostly in terms of length (one of the reasons I liked it...it's always been on my short list). The G35 is supposed to be the BMW 3 series competitor, but in terms of size, it's the ""tweener car"" that the old CTS was. The G35 is a small midsize car that's on the small size of the 5-series class in terms of length and about and inch and change shorter in wheelbase. The width is narrower, much like the old CTS. As a result, it's playing in that ""I can be a 3 series competitor and give you more room"" role that the old CTS was doing. As a result, it's simular engine power but smaller mass gives it a small advantage to the new CTS but still nips the heels of the smaller BMW.Given your previous posts, I know AWD is a bigger priority for you up in Ohio versus for me down in Tennessee. And that's fine by me. The G35 AWD will probably pull a more sporting performance that the CTS AWD given a likely 400-500 lb weight advantage. The CTS gives the driver more interior room (especially leg room) which is a bigger priority for me (top priority really). "

The thing is, to my eye, beautiful and seemingly well made (fit and finish wise, at least.)I think it is an STS killer and if that does come true, it will probably enter the LPS class. It is, at this moment in time, still a ""near"" LPS contestant. NOT because I say so, heck it is virtually in the class now by most ""measurable"" accounts (content wise.)It is not the most modern, it breaks very little new ground (if any) in the ELLPS or LPS class -- other than its styling. When compared with the LPS class it comes out as a bargain, when compared with the class ""the pundits"" place it in, however, it is about 15% or so too pricey.I do not think it is Cadillac's Phaeton -- indeed, I think it will be thought of as the beginning of a new Cadillac. It will find itself -- if it is forced to play in the LPS class -- the bargain car.That may not be enough.I would compare the new CTS with the BMW 3, the NEW (not in the US yet) A4 and perhaps an Infiniti or Lexus of the tweener variety as you suggest.Now, for me, the interior and the 300+ HP motor are winners -- and knowing GM, the lease incentives will start second quarter '08 and make the new CTS hard to resist for many of us who have ""been there done that"" with similar sized cars from Europe.

"david_fl","October 2007"," I disagree with your comment about not being able to touch that deal. I just leased a G35 sedan last week for $1600 down and $440 a month for 39 mnth/15k yr. I know if I dropped my mileage to 12k a year my price would have dropped a bunch as well, so it would be even closer to the Audi deal. I was also looking at the A4 and choose to pay a bit more for the G35. Here are some of the reasons I made that decisions simple just based on my opinions and time spent in the cars during the ""fun"" process they call car buying.The G35 just started its current model, while next year at this time everybody will be talking about he new A4 model and I did not want to be tied into an old model. I felt like I was getting more standard features with the G35 vs. the A4 (one of the real breaking points was the fact Audi simple could not offer me memory seating)The engine simple blew the Audi out of the water. Low 200's vs. low 300's, come on... not even close!I like the looks of the G35 body better than the A4. I do think the A4 with the S line exterior looks very sharp and sporty (which is standard on the 08'), I just thought it looked a bit dated, like I have seen that body style for a long time now One nifty little feature that I first thought was gimmicky is the keyless entry and engine start. I do have to say I love not needing to pull my keys out, not sure if the ""fun factor"" will wear off on that :shades: Audi did have some points that I thought were better than Infiniti thoughThe A4 has WAYYYYY better gas mileage than G35I liked the fact the A4 had a CVT transmission, I felt it was smooth and more predicable.I like the interior of the A4 a bit more than the G35. I thought the A4 was ""classier"" and had more of a premium look and feel, while I do think the G35 is nice I jest felt like it was colder and not as upscale compared with the A4All in all I would really suggest you look at what you really want and if paying a few extra $$$ is worth it in the long haul. I simply said ""it is only $40 bucks a month, I can bring my lunch for a few days to work.""Of course I went with an 07' G35 as an 08' simple did not justify the increased cost for the few extras is brought, a different story if going to actually purchase.The Lexus is a nice car, but personally I think it looks a little weird and the seats were kind of small (front and back) and the lease rates where just not close to the A4 or G35.

Seriously, never had a keyless entry car - too advanced for Porsche, I guess - but a friend has had numerous problems with his. He works for Fox News and apparantly the electromagnetic interference from the broadcast tower screws up his keyless entry. And ""Joe torque-wrench"" in the service department isn't that great at listening to his complaints. I'm of the opinion that all these techno/electronic do-dads that don't add to the DRIVING experience are conspiring to force people to sell their cars before the warranty expires. Our MDX navigation system (control unit) has been replaced twice in 2.5 years. The chances of me keeping another car 13 years and 155k miles like my 1995 Maxima are slim to none.

"circlew","October 2007"," I'm of the opinion that all these techno/electronic do-dads that don't add to the DRIVING experience are conspiring to force people to sell their cars before the warranty expires.That is exactly what is developing. Why buy a car that will cost more than fitting your children with braces just to fix the added gadgetry. More parts that will eventually fail.I switched from owning to leasing as a result. No more warranty, no more car. The added cost up front is valuable to me in two ways: new cars every three years and paying up front for only part of the depreciation. The only way I would buy is with the intent to sell at the 3-year mark.I know this is the more costly strategy. How much more is debatable and depends upon the model lease to lease. The enticing thing is opportunity to experience new choices as the market changes. Perhaps a Hydrogen-3'er soon!Regards,OW "

"blueguydotcom","October 2007"," If I never have a normal key again, that'd be great. I see no advantage to fishing a key from my pocket, fumbling for the lock and then having to put the key in the ignition. Like I said, once you live with it...it's hard to go back. I loved walking up to my BMW, getting right in and pressing go. All the old steps were gone. It just made getting my favorite part - driving - so much easier. Carrying groceries...boom right into the trunk, no stopping. Leaving the car - off, pull the e-brake, hop out and walk away. Can't be much cleaner than that. "
"leadfoot4","October 2007"," Hey all! I'm lookng for a little quick advice and or opinions. My wife's aunt has an '01 325xi with roughly 30,000 miles. She took it in to the dealer yesterday to get it's annual state safety inspection. Instead, she got the shock of her life...they told her that $1100 in repairs were necessary.First off, they said the rear brakes were totally shot. I'm assuming the e-brake mechanism probably froze up due to road salt corosion. That, in turn, probably toasted the pads and then the rotors. Not happy, but probably logical, however $500 seems a bit high to buy 2 calipers, rotors, and pads, as well as replace the parts.The second item on the list really got me, though...BOTH rear springs were broken...On a 30,000 mile car, that never has even seen anybody in the back seat! Another $500-550 to replace them. I'm not all that familiar with BMWs, does this seem normal??Thanks for any info you can provide! "
"louiswei","October 2007"," Can't agree with you more...Before I have a smart key car I don't think this is a big deal too. I was like: how tough can it be to take the key out of my pocket, put it in the ignition and twist it? But after getting used to it I was so uncomfortable with a non-smart key car.It's just one of those things that you really don't need it but once you get used to it, you can hardly go back. It's like drugs...I can't see myself owning another car without this feature. "
"blueguydotcom","October 2007"," Broken springs and bad brakes = tough or bad driving conditions. You mentioned road salt, so I presume she drives in an area with really bad roads - potholes, broken asphalt, etc? It's quite possible she did these things and as it typical of many people, simply won't cop to it or ""forgot"" about that or those incidents where she really slammed the car. Obviously, going to an independent repair shop is a much better idea (and you'll save probably 30-40%). The BMW is way out of warranty, so why in the hell are you taking the car to a stealership. Dealerships make the majority of their money on two things: used cars and repairs. Selling new cars to you only starts the cycle... "
"habitat1","October 2007"," It's all relative. 90%+ of drivers see no advantage to ""fumbling"" with a manual transmission, let alone their ignition key. And about 99% wouldn't know how to roll up windows by hand. Personally, given the enhanced ability to venture ""off course"" and detour my way around traffic jambs, I won't own another car without a navigation system.I'm sure I'd find the keyless entry feature convenient, myself. But I also forgot to mention that my 911 was in for service last week due to a convertible top that has been acting possessed. Occasionally gets stuck in the down position. I expected to hear that it was a malfunctioning motor. As it turns out, the motor is fine, but the convertible top ""computer"" was not getting/sending the proper signals and needs to be replaced. A friggin ""computer"" for the convertible top?? I am beginning to think there really is a geek conspiracy out there.P.S. A couple of years ago, a business associate who's home was the second highest in elevation in Contra Costa County (his one uphill neighbor gets the prize) had his low mileage BMW 7-series struck by lightening, while parked in his driveway. A dime sized burn mark on the hood was all that was visible from the outside. The car was deemed ""totaled"" by his insurance company and went to the boneyard. A $50k+ write-off. Apparantly, replacing every bit of fried electronics would have been more labor intensive than building a new car - with no guarantee that they wouldn't have missed something. "
"blueguydotcom","October 2007"," True. For me, never having to go for a key is just a godsend. Essentially, I carried just my BMW fob and that only left my pants/shorts when I'd get home. Otherwise a keyless life is nice.Navi to me was great in Europe.

"
"fedlawman","October 2007"," I checked out the new CTS over the weekend and I've gotta say, I'm pretty impressed. One caveat: I didn't drive a manual, so I won't talk about performance/dynamics right now. Suffice it to say the ride/handling compromise is class appropriate, with a refined driveline that has no bad manners or noticeable deficiencies.Sure, it's not the sportiest car in this segment (it's far to big and heavy for that), but I respect the fact that Cadillac didn't try to beat BMW at their own (increasingly ambiguous) game.Instead, Cadillac has built a car that has one of the nicest, roomiest cabins in this class, and trimmed it with high quality materials and appointments. It's easily the nicest cabin I've ever seen on a GM, and a match in quality and layout to anything in the class. The stitched seams on the soft-touch dashboard covering, and the wood and metallic accents are very pleasing. I found the backseat to be quite comfortable too, although as previously mentioned, the footwell is tight. Exterior styling is definitely too contrived (subjective, I know) - too many angles and random acts of chrome for my tastes, but again, it looks modern and aggressive - even attractive - and for its part, at least it doesn't look like every other car on the road. I have to respect GM for trying something different and mostly pulling it off.Personally, I think the softer, larger, and heavier 3-series has alienated many of the driving enthusiasts interested in this segment, and it will be up to the lighter, more compact 1-series to win us back over BMW. I don't know if the CTS now defines this segment - bigger and more luxurious yet still sporty, but it definitely compares favorably with the BMW and Infinity on the performance-----luxury continuum. Every car in this segment has slid way to the right on that scale over the past few years, so who can fault Cadillac for grabbing tightly onto the right end?What remains to be seen is whether GM can sell it in the volumes it deserves. I don't think the CTS will fail because of its quality, styling, features, or luxury. I think the toughest battle the CTS faces is still the stigma associated with the badge it wears on the hood. "
"cdnpinhead","October 2007"," Interesting. Thanks.You could well be correct with your assessment that Cadillac has squandered their once-revered status. Could be worse, though -- think Lincoln.Either way, the CTS carved a decent niche with its first version, and most appear to fall all over themselves exclaiming over how much better this one is.If Cadillac can get even a few BMW/Audi/Infiniti/MB people to come over, there's a huge cadre of ""buy American"" folks who'll drive it for that reason alone.Looks to me like it's going to be a winner, though it does look strange & a bit gaudy (for my taste, such as it is). "
"fedlawman","October 2007"," Agreed.I think those of us driving enthusiasts who favor BMW's are inherently opposed to gaudiness and flash. Unfortunately, I think we are in the minority.There are many others that want a car that is sporty and luxurious, yet also serves as a fashion statement (style, status, etc.). I've seen enough BMW's wearing 19"" chrome wheels to know that the CTS will be a big success. "
"cdnpinhead","October 2007"," "". . .BMW's wearing 19"" chrome wheels. . .""Oh yes.One of the things than endeared me to the Lincoln LS early on was one of the senior sales executives who would come down like the hammer of Thor on any dealer that put a ""carriage roof"" treatment on an LS. He was a real car guy, but the dealers were as clueless as the day is long, to say nothing of the people who drove Lincolns in 2000 -- all moot these days.BMW endures much of the same, though Cadillac may siphon off some of the more ostentatious with the CTS. That's a good thing.Drivers, unite!! "
"circlew","October 2007"," I loved my LS...now Lincoln is sadly....GONE.I agree with both fed and yourself regarding a nice package for the CTS...but the styling still alienates me, not to mention the Catera heritage and the stigma of arrogance from most dealers I associated with in the past in NY.I think the global enthusiasts spoke loud enough to create the 1-series. No doubt this will be a success in 2 ways...since the base model will attract yet even younger buyers and the 135 the crowd that craves perfection!Funny thing is when I explained to my wife the 1-series would come in smaller than the current 3'er, she was shocked that I would consider such a small car. She worries I will wedge under a semi and never be heard from again!Regards,OW "
"sevenfeet0","October 2007"," I think the reasonings behind BMW doing the 1 series are pretty simple, and I doubt it came as backlash from 3 series owners (that car still has crazy sales numbers). The fact is that the BMW 3 series had grown in size and purpose from its 2002tii roots and that there was a potential model that could be inserted there now. That combined with the fact that the 3 series is getting so expensive that it is pricing itself out of the hands of its youngest customers makes the business case. "
"kdshapiro","October 2007","  All these entry levels are expensive, the 250 isn't expensive. The 1 series will appeal to the Mazda 3 and VW GTI crowd. "
"fedlawman","October 2007"," I agree. I also think it will also appeal to the Audi A3/A4 crowd, the Mazda 6 and Accord Coupe crowd, and perhaps most of all, the BMW 3-series crowd (the ones that want an E46, but shopping the E90/E92 because it's the only game in town).It'll be interesting to see if the first few months following the 1-series debut has an effect on 3-series sales.

"pmc4","November 2007"," I can't see how the BMW wins that comparison. I mean, to see what the 3-Series really is, just go to Europe, where it's made. What are they in Europe? Are they luxury sedans? Sports sedans? Nope and nope; they're... You guessed it... TAXI'S!In fact, the only difference between the Euro-spec BMW and the US-spec BMW is the options list. The Euro-spec BMW 3-Series comes standard with a tachometer, fuel gauge, automatic transmission, vinyl-padded interior surfaces and an engine with six cylinders.American-spec BMW 3-Series adds leather, i-drive, and about $25,000 to the sticker price.The Cadillac and Infiniti on the other hand are purpose-built, true luxury/sport sedans that are well worth the $$$ printed on the window sticker: They're roomy, comfortable, leather-lined (the BMW uses vinyl padding-not leather. Think 1970's naugahyde sofa) cruisers with the world's most advanced powertrains and chassis'. "
"blueguydotcom","November 2007"," pm04,Benz actually seems to own the taxi market in Europe but I'm not sure how your taxi thing is a dig against any car. In Asia the Corolla seems to be the most common taxi car. Is that a bad thing? No, but I think you're making an argument that only holds water if you're a status buyer. The Euro-spec BMW 3-Series comes standard with a tachometer, fuel gauge, automatic transmission, vinyl-padded interior surfaces and an engine with six cylinders.No in Germany and most of Europe the 3 series comes with a manual standard and 4 cylinder engines. Seriously, do some research. 6 cylinder non-diesel BMWs (and Benzes and Audi/VWs, etc) are pretty rare outside of the USA. The 318d and 320d are actually the more common 3 series in Europe; our 328i's 6 cylinder is considered a luxury and a waste of money; the 335 is primarily for speed junkies in europe as the 330d is the most popular 6 cylinder 3 outside the USA. Gas prices are way too expensive in Europe to opt for a standard gas-burner 6 cylinder.American-spec BMW 3-Series adds leather, i-drive, and about $25,000 to the sticker price.Your ignorance knows no bounds, apparently. Go ahead and visit www.BMW.de ...we'll wait. Hit the 3 and then 3 Limo and Konfigurator. Okay, so for the 318din Germany - that's a 1.8 liter diesel - the starting price is 29,950 euros. In US dollars that's a starting price of $43,966. The 335i in Germany starts at 44,350E or $65,105 US Dollars. Go ahead and check the France, UK and Italy sites if you'd like too. In every case, the 3 series is far more expensive than it is in the USA.Via European Delivery, any US citizen can pick up a 335i in Munich with leather, 6 speed, sport package, xenons, power memory seats, active steering lights, moonroof, comfort access, metallic paint for ~$40,000 US Dollars. I personally, would not opt for leather on another BMW (unlike my 2006 330i that I bought via European Delivery for $35,700 US Dollars), so the price of an ED 335i will run me closer to about 38.5k with the features I do want - ala carte pricing is so nice for those of us who want an exactly spec'ed car.Sadly, an Infiniti G35 with moonroof, leather, sport package, active steering lights, memory seats and 6 speed will run me $38,865 US Dollars. Unfortunately, Infiniti forces me to get packages I don't want - namely a worthless navigation package. Still I'm sure I could negotiate 2500 off that price so we'll say $36,000 US Dollars for the Infiniti. That's cheaper than the 335i still but not by much. Considering I must pay for maintenance on the G35, let's add $1000 to maintain the Infiniti over 4 years /50k miles. So for a $1500 savings I can opt for a car I don't really like, G35, and that doesn't objectively perform as well as a 335i, or just pay the extra $1500 and drive something I like more and that objectively performs better.As I said before: for me with ED the pricing becomes moot and it's about picking the car I like to drive. The comparo swings wildly to the BMW's favor once you negate the pricing. "
"shov8","November 2007"," Just a minor point on your post. You state you can get the G35 configured in a way you don't like (the navigation system), vs. the built-to-order ED 335i. The big caveat here that is not addressed is the ""ED"" part. With ED (European Delivery) you have to physically travel to Munich and pick up the car. ED does include shipping back to the USA and delivery to your dealer (a total of 8-10 weeks later, according to the web site). But the cost of flying to Munich and back, plus at least one night (probably two) in a hotel, isn't included. A sample trip in February 2008 (because you need to allow three months to build the BMW according to bmw.com) from San Diego, CA to Munich runs around $2000 on Expedia. Then there is a night or two in a hotel, plus misc expenses. I'm just getting a ball-park figure, but lets say $2500 minimum for the trip. So that +$1500 cost for the 335i just went up to +$4000 total. True, you do get to go to Munich  so that is a bonus. Of course, you need to take time off from work, etc., so maybe that cancels that out. Still, we are trying to compare cost, so I think the trip cost should be added in. Since you took delivery of a 330i via ED maybe you could share the expenses involved with that so we could make an accurate 335i via ED vs G35 cost comparison. Thanks, kc "
"blueguydotcom","November 2007","  With ED (European Delivery) you have to physically travel to Munich and pick up the car.That's what ED is. Shrug.

Hell, we just spent two weeks in Thailand and had I bought some major ticket item at that moment I wouldn't consider the flight as a cost as I'd be there on vacation anyway. Should I opt for another BMW, I'm fairly sure we'll make a vacation of it as we have friends living in Paris and London. In fact just last night we began talking about a trip to France in late 08 or 09.Since you took delivery of a 330i via ED maybe you could share the expenses involved with that so we could make an accurate 335i via ED vs G35 cost comparison. Thanks,Flight = $900 (of course I've got about 200k in Frequent Flyer miles now so it'd be free. Additionally, Lufthansa has a two-for-one BMW special) *Two nights at Munich Marriott - $100 (or use Starwood points for free hotel stays)Train to BMW Delivery Center = $8 euros (about $11 US)Ride to Marriott from Redelivery Center - $35 USLufthansa Airport Shuttle from Munich Marriott to MUC - $14 USFood - ~$100 US (actually far less as food is cheap in Germany)*This was a vacation so I just factored in my Germany costs. In actuality I drove south through Germany, Austria and Switzerland into Italy and then swung west through the South of France. I eventually drove through France and back into Switzerland, Austria and Germany. I noted my Germany costs only as over the entire trip I spent far more but that included nights on the French Riviera and seaside hotels. FWIW, if Infiniti or some other manu had a JD delivery program (and cars worth driving) I'd take another vacation to Japan. "
"shov8","November 2007"," Looks like about $1200 extra from your list of expenses. I think, if it were not for the vacation part, your airfare would be more expensive. Not sure if the airlines like a Saturday night stay like they do domestically, but when I looked prices up on a Tues to Thurs trip it was around $2000 for airfare. I don't think many people will be in your situation, that is, having the time/money to take a vacation and pick up a car. Plus the waiting time to have the car built (three months), then shipped back (8-10 weeks, or more), is a limiting factor for a lot of people. You're talking almost 6 months before you actually get your car in the garage.  I guess my point is, your original post stated that given the ED pricing the 335i wins the comparison, but not everyone can do the ED thing. I'm not saying that getting a 335i for <$40k even with the European trip is a bad thing, far from it, it's just that only a few probably do the ED experience (I wonder how many do it?) given the time/cost factors and therefore ED pricing shouldn't be used as a factor in a car comparison. Thanks,  kc "
"blueguydotcom","November 2007"," I understand your point of view, but can't really agree with it. I'd contend a majority of people buying in the entry-lux market fits a few criteria:1. They already have a car.2. They spend a bit of time looking for a car3. They have the option of waiting for an ordered car - but many choose not to wait. 4. Most are in fairly comfortable jobs that have PTO and most take some kind of vacation.BMW's Roundel mag had an article on ED. The numbers are growing yearly and have been for decades. Still it makes up a small fraction but it's significant enough that Audi kicked in their program this year and it's a bit more generous with knick-knacky silly things like ""free hotel"" stays and such.As for considering it for pricing: most people have the choice. Priorities I guess. "

"habitat1","November 2007"," ED as a way to save money buying a BMW comes up on a regular basis and the pros and cons are debated as if there is a ""right"" answer. There isn't. Having two associates that purchsed BMW's in the last 2 months highlights the differences. The one that purchased via ED took his wife to Europe for a 10 day vacation. They bought a 335i convertible and had a great time enjoying the experience. The cost of the vacation was more thn offset by the savings, especially since the car was not one that is being discounted much, if at all, stateside. He paid $1,500 over ED invoice and saved $5,500+ over the US MSRP.The other person, who previously bought a BMW in 1996 via ED considered going that route again. But given that he now has kids (3) at home and the trip could not be converted, practically or economically, into a family vacation, he decided to buy stateside. He bought an in-stock 550ia at close to invoice, and would have only saved an additional $3,000 going the ED route. He is a freelance attorney, with an hourly billing rate of around $500 and could not justify going away for 3-4 days to essentially save perhaps $1,500, after expenses. For some, the idea of ED is a very appealing way to take advantage of a significant price break, especially on certain models. But I certainly respect that, for others, time is money and the ED savings, while not insignificant, may not meet their ""return"" requirments, given the time it takes.I would agree with the suggestion, however, that ED should at least be explored and considered as an alternative. Almost everyone I know that has done it has had a great experience. The one exception is a friend who's (frequent flier) flight was cancelled and he went through hell and great expense rebooking to pick up the car within the required deadline. But even he admits that, once he got there, it was a worthwhile experience, albeit not much of a savings. "
"circlew","November 2007"," I suspect the 135i will be the new old 3-series. I believe the size/weight is comparable to an E46. Price is $4-5K lower, repectively.BMW this week released preliminary pricing details on the BMW 1-Series coupe, which will go on sale in America in spring 2008. U.S. pricing will start at $29,375 for the 128i and $35,675 for the 135i, with a fully-loaded car costing another ten grand on top of that.The 135i features the same 300+ horsepower twin-turbocharged inline-six as the 335i 3-Series. Predictably, the 128i has the same powerplant as the 328i, delivering 230 horsepower.Pricing for optional equipment on the 128i is not yet available, but the 135i can be ordered with a slew of options pushing its price tag close to $45,000.A six-speed automatic transmission costs $1,275, the Premium Package is $3,300, the Sport Package is $1,000, the Cold Weather kit is $600, Active Steering costs $1,400, paddle shifters are a mere $100, Comfort Access adds $500, power front seats cost $1000, heated front seats are another $500, rear park assist is $350, navigation is $2,100, Bluetooth is $750, HD radio is $350, XM costs $595, premium audio is $875, and iPod adapter is $400, metallic paint adds another $475, and premium Boston Leather is $1,450.Since many of these standalone options are included in larger options packages, adding up all the prices won't give an accurate estimate of the cost of a fully-loaded 135i. However, taking packages into consideration, we've determined a fully-loaded 135i would cost $44,500.Regards,OW "

"habitat1","November 2007"," I'm not a BMW marketing exec and, in fact, have never even owned one. But this notion that BMW is overpricing its cars is, based upon some hard historical data I've looked at, is absurd.Sorry I can't go back to the days of the sardine can 2002 tii for my analysis, but thanks to an old Kelly Blue Book, I can go back 20 years. Here are some figures for you to digest (all base MSRP prices):BMW Prices: 1987 325i Sedan - $28,190 2007 328i Sedan - $32,400 Increase in Percentage - 14.9%Honda Prices: 1987 Accord LX - $13,752 2007 Accord LX - $20,925 (4 cylinder) Increase in Percentage - 52.2%Toyota Prices: 1987 Corolla LE - $8,853 2007 Corolla LE - $16,315 Increase in Percentage - 84.3%I'm sorry, guys, I'm not tryong to sound elitist, but, in the past, BMW was a relatively EXPENSIVE car to be ASPIRED to. I graduated from a top 10 business school with an MBA in 1981 and looked forward to the day when I might be able to afford a BMW. That was Director/VP territory, not standard fare for an entry level analyst. Today, the 328i is barely priced above a loaded Accord V6 ($30k+ MSRP for the EX-L V6). The 3 series has never been cheaper, relatively speaking. And the fact that the 1-series apparantly won't undercut that price by the 30% some would like to see is frankly, too damn bad. The 135 has nearly 50 more horsepower than the original M1, for goodness sakes. It's hardly your Dad's 1600/2000 which, by the way, were WAY more than twice as expensive as the Honda Civics of their vintage. So pony up for a BMW 3 series or 1 series if you can afford it. But stop your bellyaching if you can't. Because you sure as hell wouldn't have been driving a 3 series 20 years ago either, if that's the case today. I, for one, don't want to see BMW stoop to cost cutting or ""value engineering"" just to compete for the dollars that probably should be more prudently spent on a Honda or Toyota. "
"tayl0rd","November 2007"," That just proves that BMW's pricing was even more absurd back then than it is now! I've always said their cars are overpriced for what you get, and I still hold to that in spite of being the happy (for now) new owner of an '08 550i Sport. :blush: And, yes, it's overpriced. Nice, but overpriced all the same. "
"habitat1","November 2007"," On the one hand, I should be congratulating you on getting an exceptional car. But given your statement, I have to question your prudence for buying a car you think is overpriced. Value is highly subjective and relative, but 6 years ago, when I decided the difference between a $32k Honda S2000 and a $55k Boxster S was not worth it, I bought the S2000. Two years ago, under different circumstances, I bought a 911S. My priorities and value equation had changed. But I still shopped like hell to get a $10k+ discount. No need to overpay. I would never brag about buying a car (or anything) that I truly thought was overpriced relative to the alternatives or its intrinsic value to me. It makes one seem like they have more dollars than sense.In any event, enjoy your 550i. And take some consolation that it would probably hold its own against a 1988 M5 which ran $49,050 back then.

Yes the 335i is 38% more than the 1987 325i, but then the current top of the line Accord EX-L V6 at $30,260 is 96% more than the top of the line 1987 Accord LX-i 4 door at $15,434. And, if you want to get really off track, the current 335i compares very favorably performance and size wise to a 1988 M5 that ran $49,050, 26% MORE than the current 335i. To answer your question, the 1987 325 (no ""e"" or ""i"") had a base price of $24,655. So the current 328i has a base price 33.0% higher than the bottom of the line 3 series in 1987. But again, comparing bottom of the line Accords, the current LX 4 cylinder manual at $20,360 is 87.2% more than the 1987 DX at $10,874. Whether or not some consider the current 3 series or upcoming 1 series too big, too heavy, not as much fun as the little 3 series or 1600/2000's of old is a completely different matter. But when you look just at the price, it's hard not to conclude that there are more people that can afford a 3 series today that could have only dreamed of one in 1987. BMW's sales figures and increases in market share seem to reflect this. And there may be at least a few people who can't afford an Accord today, that could have in 1987. They are now buying Hyundai's and the like.P.S. A 1994 850 CSi? $101,500. :surprise: "

And at cruising speed, the sound of the V8 completely disappears. The I6 definitely makes enough fuss at speed to make it known that it's working hard for you. In a 3-series, that's tolerable. In a 5-series, at that price, it's totally unacceptable. That's why, when I was still searching, my focus was mainly on the V8 cars (A6 4.2, M45, E550, GS430, 550i.)

The last event we did was to drive each of three cars for 3 laps around what I would call a small, rather tight road race loop as fast as we wanted to go / as fast as we could go. We first took turns driving a 6 cylinder X-5, and were amazed at how we could sling that vehicle around the corners. Next, we drove an M-5 with SMG. It handled great, and had power, but not as overwhelming as I had imagined. Lastly, we drove a 335i with Steptronic and sport suspension- wow, was that car a screamer! I think over that short loop, with us two ametuers driving, the 335i was faster than the M-5. Just like in my own 535Xi, the engine in the 335i was uber responsive and very fast in acceleration.One of the instructors said they have driven the 135i. He said they did a drag race with an M-6, and up to about 80 mph the 135i was faster.Bruce "
"habitat1","November 2007"," I agree, that asking price is high by $7-$10k. However, not sure where you are getting 6 years old. My (late production) 2005 911S is 26 months old. The local BMW dealer wants me to come in for a ""great deal"" on a brand new 2007 550i 6-speed (not a demo 23 miles on odometer). So, worst case scenario, that M5 is just barely 5 years old, possible as little as 4 and a couple of months, but definitely not 6.And also, don't forget that M5's sold for at least 100%+ of MSRP, with no ability to get European Delivery discounts. So, you can't really compare resale prices of a limited production car like the M5 to a mass produced 550i. The 2007 that the dealer called me on has an MSRP of $69,880. I told him not to waste my time unless he's weilling to take at least $9,000 off and his response was that I could have the car for $61k tomorrow, if I wanted it. At this particiular dealership, if I had asked for a $500 discount on a 2003 M5, I would have been laughed out of the showroom. "
"tayl0rd","November 2007"," You did see where I said ""it was probably sold in 2002 which means it's near 6 calendar years old,"" right? We're heading headlong into 2008 right now. 2008 - 2002 = 6Near means close, but not quite, or next to, or in the vacinity of. :PAnd why can't I compare the prices? An M5 depreciates the same as any other 5-series. It just has a much higher initial price, and price gouging is NEVER accounted for in resale. The depreciation is relatively the same. Limited edition or not, it's still an outdated model. The mass produced thing is also relative. I believe someone (wasn't it you?) said there are actually more M5s in the States than there are V8 5-series, year-to-year. That would make a V8 non-M 5-series more exclusive and rare than an M5. So my 550i Sport should theoretically hold it's relative value better than an M5!  Especially with it being a stick. "
"spiritinthesky","November 2007"," I happen to own a 2003 M5 with 45k miles. And, coincidentally, before I bought the M5, I had been all set to purchase a 545i Sport 6-speed. The party that had the M5 on order defaulted, dealer called me and I came in with a check for full MSRP that afternoon. The M5 certainly depreciates, but not proportionally as much as the standard V8 5-series. At least not in my (Pittsburgh) area. I paid $75,800 for mine, and have been offered $38,000 in cash (not trade) by the dealer. The 545i had an MSRP of $62,000 and would probably be worth around $26,000 today (rough estimate by my dealer). The big difference is that the M5 has a dedicated enthusiast following. Everyone knows what it is. The 545i/550i 6-speeds are very nice cars, but less than 10% of V8 buyers opt for the 6 speed. The vast majority are automatics and sold to an affluent, but not necessarily ""driving enthusiast"" demographic. That definitely makes resale a bit more of a challenge and my dealer indicated he would only take a 545/550 of any kind on a trade (would not buy for cash). I didn't buy the M5 with resale value being a high consideration. But I'm pretty sure that if I looked at the numbers, I'd get most of the additional $15k I spent on the M5 over the 545i back, if I decided to part with it tomorrow. But I have no interest in doing that. It still drives like the day I bought it and there really is nothing sweeter in a sedan than that hand built M engine effortlessly running up to redline or that sport suspension handling the curves almost as well as my 911 Turbo. P.S. I bought in May 2003, making it exactly 4 1/2 years old. As in precisely. "
"blueguydotcom","November 2007"," 2008s are on the lot. Whether you bought that 2003 car in January of 2004 or September of 02, a 2003 car is viewed as 5 years old. "

"lovemyclk","November 2007"," As a 2003 530SP owner (Titanium Silver/Black), this is one beautiful M5! All mine lacks is the punch from the new TT motor, but I'd seriously give a clean, low-mileage '03 M5 a close look.It only worth what someone is willing to pay for it, but agree tht it is priced at least 5-7K too high. Owner is adding a low miles premium and it does appear to be in fantastic condition.As much as I love some of the new cars on the market from BMW, Audi, Infiniti, etc.; I still maintain an attachment to my car. After any test drive of another vehicle, I drive my car home and understand what a great ride it is all over again!Will say that the new Audi S5 intrigues me. Very nice car. 6-sp only at this time, with Tiptronic on the way around April '08. Drives beautifully as a high performance touring coupe. Would not even consider a MB CLK after driving the S5. 335 Coupe is still strong, IMO, due to being such a great performer.

Likewise 1987 was the last year the Corolla was produced as a subcompact. Even discounting the huge shift in brand perception over the past decades, you can't make apples to apples comparisons when the vehicles aren't even in the same class anymore. "
"circlew","December 2007"," Here is some news. I could not tell if some of the models will be applicable and perhaps some of the future names could be part of the ELLPS category. It just goes to show the continued muddied direction that boggles the mind!If you liked alphabet soup as a kid, make an appointment at your Cadillac dealer for three to five years from now. That's because GM has recently trademarked several new nameplates for Cadillac, and so far we're worried and a bit confused.At present, these names are trademarked in Europe and Canada. However, companies often register their trademarks in foreign markets first, and later in the United States.This potential new naming system is undoubtedly complicated, but we will try and lay it out in the simplest way possible. So far, GM has trademarked: * DT7 * CT6 * CT5 * BT3 * AT1 * DTX * CTX * BTXWe suspect the numbers in each name signifies each vehicle's overall size.The ""DT7"" might be the eventual DTS replacement, for example. This large, luxury sedan may end up riding on the Zeta chassis in a few years time.The CT6 and CT5 would be some kind of variants of the car we currently know as the CTS. One possibility is the numbers indicate two possible wheelbase lengths. On the other hand, we can't rule out the ""5"" and ""6"" being the current CTS sedan and forthcoming CTS coupe.The BT3 could represent the next-generation BLS. This vehicle would probably be on the Epsilon II chassis, however, with GM's plans on the new Alpha chassis being unclear, there is always a possibility BT3 could be an Alpha car.The AT1 is still a bit of a mystery. That said, it's a safe bet that this would be a small car that is definitely based on the Alpha chassis GM is currently developing. Could it be a competitor to the BMW 1-Series?The ""X"" cars will more than likely denote crossover or wagon vehicles. However we'd also leave open the option that the ""X"" indicates all-wheel-drive models.If the crossover assumption is true, the DTX is probably the vehicle currently known as the BRX. The CTX could be the forthcoming CTS wagon, and the BTX remains a mystery.Of course, the all-wheel-drive option is also a strong possibility. The CTX could be an AWD CT6 or CT5, while the DTX would be an AWD DT7, and so on.Obviously there is one glaring part of Cadillac's lineup not mentioned here &#151; the Escalades. Some might suggest that the ""X"" vehicles we just talked about are in fact the trucks. However, given what our sources say, we don't think that's the case.That leaves a few options. One being that GM just hasn't gotten around to coming up with new names. Another being that the true Cadillac trucks will not be part of this new scheme and continue on with regular names. With the marketing power the Escalade name carries, we think the latter is more likely. :confuse: Regards,OW "
"vic10","December 2007"," Am I the only one who thinks this new branding (Cadillac is not alone) is just a stupid gimmick? I miss Coupe de Ville, Sedan de Ville, Park Avenue, Bonneville, to name a few..... GM probably hired a consultant to come up the new designations, paid six figures or more. I'm sure there were better places to spend the money.... "

"laurasdada","December 2007"," Just the facts... Not a bash. While it appears that GM is beginning to produce some worth(ier) products, this kind of recall just reinforces that last 30+ years of GM ""quality."" All mfg.'s have recalls and quality issues. It's just that the domestics have a streak going that, while hopefully slowing down, continues... If, instead of pouring millions of $ into the ad campaign that ""Quality is Job 1,"" Ford had spent that money on improving quality, who knows???And, while I remain really ticked off at the domestics (because, there is no doubt in my mind that GM/Ford/Chrysler could build world class cars. In fact, in Europe I think that they do), I'm not a basher (well, certainly not as much as I used to be...!) Hey,my last car was a Chrysler 300M, really enjoyed it. Some initial quality issues taken care of under warranty. No issues outside the warranty period, but still being a Chrysler I wasn't going to keep it too long out of warranty... Also, build quality was certainly less than spectacular. But, still enjoyed that car! And, I'm considering a (used) Caddy XLR as a toy. But, the interior far from reflects the price and, well, it's a GM... :P My current ride, assembled here in Los Estados Unidos, is certainly screwed together to much higher tolerances than the Chrysler. No issues, other than a couple of rattles, at 33k+ miles.So anyway, Happy Holidays to all. Gotta find all the receipts for the gifts that don't fit the Evil Wife. :sick: (Luckily for me, they're too big!!!) "
"circlew","December 2007"," It's interesting and quite ironic, really, that the US needs to import cars like the G8 to get the higher level of build quality for a dying brand. Like I've said before, Caddy just does not pique my interest in the least even with the new CTS. No bash intended...just a personal choice. BTW, I saw a Catera on Saturday and felt more pain!I once toyed with the idea of an XLR as a fun car but considering it's a 'Vette clone, why not just the C6 'verte? The edges are NOT appealing IMO.All the best during the Holidays and Happy New Year!Regards "
"laurasdada","December 2007"," And to you, OW, Happy/Merry!You ever have an inexplicable car desire (Bricklin, DeLorean, Subaru SVX)? Mine appears to be the XLR. I think it's the HT convertible, just a gadget that has always appealed to me. And overall I like the exterior style of the XLR. Of course, I don't like some of the GM-cheapness e.g. the plastic looking grille and, well, the interior. Indeed the issue for me (and I'll assume many potential XLR buyers) is the price. Even a couple of years used, the asking prices compare to some formidable new cars, e.g. aforementioned Corvette, Audi A/S5 and BMW 3, Jag XF among others...So, more than likely it will be an unfulfilled inexplicable desire. Probably should just save my nickels for a new/cpo Jag XK: Beeeeautiful. Or a Maser Gran Turismo: Mas Beeeeatuiful...My father, in what I can only assume was a moment of insanity and charity, bought a Catera. He was surprisingly happy with the ride and comfort. Unfortunately, the opportunity to enjoy said ride was somewhat limited by its penchant to visit the service bay... :sick: Least reliable car he's ever owned...But, recent recalls aside (and can they be put aside?), I think the new CTS is a winner, especially for a GM! The first CTS, to me, was a styling abomination both outside and, even more so, inside. But, it sold, so good for GM!Do Australian-built cars offer quality? I thought not...? "
"clarkster","December 2007"," My sentiments EXACTLY laurasdada!!! Never have I drooled so much over a prospective car as I have the XLR. I just think it's a bit cost prohibitive for me. Such a SEXY luxury sports car though. If I could find an 07 in the low $50k price range, I'd jump on it like a duck on a junebug! So I stumble upon the CTS yesterday and have been under the ether ever since! What a car...and over $30K less than a new XLR once all the options are added to it! I'd already have ordered one online had it not been for a few articles I've read about this mysterious CTC-Coupe that might be coming out this summer. Now I could certainly wait til August if that is indeed the case. No one seems to know for sure yet...maybe next month we'll find out for sure.I just wish the XLR were a bit more reasonable.

"laurasdada","December 2007"," Welcome, Clark. Check ebaymotors.com and autotrader.com for used XLRs. '05s advertised in low $40s, '06 in the upper $50s.

"circlew","January 2008"," The new Genesis puts the pressure on BMW...ChassisThe car boasts a 53/47 front-to-rear weight distribution, which comes fairly close to the coveted 50/50 ratio made popular by BMW. Hyundai says the car's body structure is 12 to 14 percent stiffer than a BMW 5-Series or Mercedes E-Class. Despite this, the unibody is lighter than that of either the 5er or E. The car is still heavy, particularly with the V-8 but at $30K to start, bests even the cars on the ELLPS in many categories other than price, IMO.Regards,OW "
"vic10","January 2008"," I doubt that those who willing pay a premium price for the privilege of being able to say they drive a BMW or Mercedes will even be aware that Hyundai has a car named Genesis (if they are even aware of a car company named Hyundai.). More than likely the Genesis will pull buyers from the Azera, who are mainly Avalon wannabees, and maybe from the Avalon itself. If Hyundai really wants to make an impact on the upscale market, they need to do what Toyota did with Lexus: Create a new brand with separate dealerships manned with obsequious sales staff. Make the brand flawless and then wait several years for a reputation to build. "
"blueguydotcom","January 2008"," The brand didn't make Lexus...the LS400 did. The car. The brand was meaningless. 20 years ago everybody scoffed at the notion of the Japanese making a RWD V8 sedan that could compete with BMW and MB. The Lexus dealerships had nothing to do with sales; the product and the price sold the Lexus LS400 and made Lexus into what it is today (highly overpriced). Euro snobs laughed at the Japanese competitors and said people wanted an established brand. People wanted a luxury nameplate. People bought the badge. And that's somewhat true. Of course, Lexus also offered a 35k v8 luxury sedan that undercut the Euro competition by well over 10k. Suddenly luxury sedans were well within reach for people who didn't want to fork over dough for a Jag, Benz or Bimmer.The Genesis will appeal to the same folks and I really seeing it hitting Infiniti, Lexus and Acura the hardest (most likely Acura and Infiniti will take it hard). Why spend 50k on an M45 or 5 series when you can get a Genesis for 40k and it's decked out the same way? "
"louiswei","January 2008"," If Lexus is overpriced then just about every other luxury brand (exclude Infiniti) is overpriced, including MB and BMW. However, that's another subject all together.I wouldn't say the dealership and service had nothing to do with Lexus' success. True, without the car, the brand is nothing but Lexus' success was built on a decent car at good value (the LS400 was not THAT good) and industry leading dealership experience and service. There are many folks out there who don't know what Edmunds is but like to be treat like kings and queen and Lexus captured them perfectly. Lexus may not know how to build a better driving machine than BMW but they sure do know how to make their brand ""luxurious"" and how to treat their customers right.Personally I don't think Lexus, Infiniti and Acura have much to worry about with the Genesis. IMO the Chrysler 300, Dodge Charger, Pontiac G8, Buick Lucerne, Toyota Avalon and Hyundai's own Azera are going to be the biggest loser due to the Genesis launch.No (okay, very little) luxury buyer is going to be attracted to a car whose manufacture is too shameful to put its emblem on the hood (or grille)... "
"vic10","January 2008"," ""The brand didn't make the car....""True. But Lexus would not have risen to the level of acceptance (as luxury) as quickly if it had been called a Toyota and sold side by side with Corollas. My opinion.... "
"blueguydotcom","January 2008"," The price and quality of the LS400 and Q45 sold them. The dealer network may have had a part in repeat sales but initially it was all about a luxury car nearly on par with BMW/MB/Jag for a crazy deal. Personally, I think Lexus drew in people who aspired to own a luxury car. Hell, today plenty of people in their 20s think Lexus is a luxury make! I think Hyundai will pull in plenty of aspirational buyers. "
"laurasdada","January 2008"," ""...(the LS400 was not THAT good)...""Actually, the LS400 was that good. I remember (well, I think I remember. I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now...) the reviews: shock and awe. The LS was very much Mercedes-like at ~1/2 the price. The Q was very much BMW-like at ~1/2 the price. But, of course, Infiniti opted for the classic ""Rocks and Sticks"" ad campaign...The lesser models of Lexus and Inifiniti were just that, lesser. Filler to get folks into the showroom. I agree with BGDC, the big dogs made the marques (much less so Infiniti, of course. They had a much longer and winding road to today's level of success). The dealer service was also a selling point. I believe the late 80s, early 90s were the height of the German sales arrogance. That had to change... "
"blueguydotcom","January 2008"," The G35 came out and offered almost 3 series handling, power, RWD, etc with a whole bunch of rough edges. It saved Infiniti. The I35 and G20 had been huge flops because they didn't match the top dogs at anything, so even for less you were getting much less. The G35 changed entry sport lux. Had the G35 been priced the same as the 3 series, regardless of dealer experience, do you think it would have done 4-6k units a month? The Acura TL at 32-35k is a fantastic deal and we know they move 5-7k a month. Would they push that many at 40k? "
"circlew","January 2008"," IMO, the G is what makes the 3 get better, OK, so they added more weight but I'll bet the weight issue is at the top of the ""to do"" list going forward for ALL of the engineers. Think 35 MPG...not to mention that carbon fiber and such lighhtweight componenets will become more prevalent on the lesser ELLPS. Now, the CTS wants a little respect. OK, so lets see how many sales Caddy takes away from the Germans and the Japanese. I would suspect some interesting numbers considering the exchange rate issue.Regards,OW "
"blueguydotcom","January 2008"," I'm talking about the first gen G35. It's an allusion to the impact the LS had on the luxury market. The G35 took the sport luxury market in a way no one had done before - at least successfully - RWD/ 4 door sedan/manual, RWD/2 door coupe/manual. The first gen was dirt cheap, rouge around the edges and it challenged BMW (and MB/Audi to some bit). The latest one, just like newer gens of the LS, got more expensive and became more refined. "
"louiswei","January 2008"," The first gen was dirt cheapTrue, and the interior looks and felt dirt cheap as well.However, I do agree that we can compare the first gen G35 to the 3-series like the first gen LS400 to the S-class. "
"habitat1","January 2008"," Back when the Lexus LS400 and Infiniti Q45 first came out, I was working for a Fortune 500 company and every other VP and SVP started looking at them.

Lexus gave very good luxury- albeit in a boring to drive chassis - with Toyota like dependability.By the way, I always enjoy looking back in my old Kelly Blue Book as to what those cars actually cost at the time. The Lexus and Infiniti came out in 1990, but giving them a year to ""establish"" themselves, here are the comparisons from the 1991 model year:Lexus LS 400: $41,650 / 110"" wheelbaseInfiniti Q45: $40,385 / 113"" wheelbaseMercedes E300: $47,550 / 110"" wheelbaseMercedes S420: $64,800 / 121"" wheelbaseMercedes S560: $76,750 / 121"" wheelbaseBMW 535i: $43,600 / 108"" wheelbaseBMW 735i: $56,500 / 116"" wheelbaseSo the Lexus and the Infiniti were sized between the 5/E and 7/S classes, but priced below the 5/E.What is really interesting is how little Mercedes and BMW prices have increased since 1991. Their ""fat days"" came to an end after Lexus, Infiniti and Acura came to the US - and today BMW's and Mercedes are certainly not exclusively the territory of VP's and above on the corporate ladder. Heck 16 years ago a 1992 Mercedes SL500 roadster had an MSRP of $100k. More than a 2008 Porsche 911S Cabriolet! And more than a 2008 SL550! "
"fedlawman","January 2008"," It's not just the luxury cars. The MSRP's of the 1991 Nissan 300ZX Turbo, Mitsubishi 3000GT VR-4, and BMW M3 were all in the mid to upper $30K's.Considering that today, $35K buys a 300hp Subaru STi or BMW 135i, you can see just how exotically priced those early-90's halo cars truly were. On the other hand, I guess one has to consider the cost of the technology back then to mass produce a car that basically, in 1991, had the same performance specs as the current crop of hot GT cars. For instance, put the 300ZX TT and 135i side by side and, by today's standards, the Nissan still holds up (in both performance and styling). Pretty impressive actually... "

"habitat1","January 2008"," In relative Dollar Value terms, the 1991 S560 would cost $113,603 today. The '08 S550 is $86,700 base but the S600 is $144,200 I think you are a little light on your ""relative value"" calculation. Your figure represents a 48% increase over 17 years (2.33% annual compounded). CPI datea shows about a 57.1% increase over the past 17 years. CPIOn that basis, the 1991 S560 would now cost about $120,600. A 1992 600SEL had an MSRP of $132,650, or the equivalent of $196,400 today. And that 1992 600SEL is less powerful than the base 2008 S550. The AMG's are in a completely different league. I don't particularly buy the CPI, however. In 1991 a year's tuition at my alma mater was $13,100. In 2008, it is $35,500, a 170% increase. Even with the current housing market funk, my house is worth at least 3 times more (200% increase) today than it was worth in 1991. "
"circlew","January 2008"," OK, I'm with you. Agreed CPI is not everyones basket of goods over the years. Look at computers. The price index is inverted between the late '80's and now. And the power difference is thousands of percent over the early models.At the end of the day, the competition proves useful. Back pre-1990, Caddy and Lincoln were not considered competition, IMO.

"activex111","March 2008"," hi,i am pretty much down to Audi A3 or IS 250 when looking for a smaller luxury car. Both have excellent mileage and that was one of the main factor giving the gas prices these days. Thinking of 2006 Audi A3 or 2005 IS250. Liked the interior of IS250, but it is still pricey. Not sure which one to choose. i am trying to compare the common issues, maintenance costs and dealer/mfg customer service levels..Any help? THANKS "
"shipo","March 2008"," Don't know if a back seat is important to you, however, while I'm only 5'8"", when I got in the IS250 and set the front seat for my body, I was almost unable to get into the left rear seat. Trying the same thing in the A3 was a breeze as there is easily two to three inches more overall leg room in the Audi.Best Regards,Shipo "
"blueguydotcom","March 2008"," We've got an A3 - 2006 with DSG. In terms of room it's far, far bigger inside than the Lexus. We easily take 4 adults in an A3. We use it to make trips to costco, storage, etc. Shockingly our 2006 has held its value really well. We paid 22k for it in March 2007 and with 27k miles it's still worth at least 21k. The engine's powerful, yet the car gets great gas mileage and the DSG is still fun to play with. It handles poorly but then again so does the Lexus. On the downside, Audi service is horrible. I had no idea how good I had it with BMW until I took our Audi in for the ""free"" maintenance. One of the passenger door lock switches blistered and the rubber came off it. The scumbags at Audi of America said it was a trim and normal wear piece so the warranty did not apply. They said repair of the SWITCH would be $300. Seriously, how awful is Audi? My wife swore up and down, telling me she loves the car but we will never buy an Audi again. A 2 year old car with a blistered door switch and it's not covered by the warranty? That's obscene - especially when it's obviously a defect, not a result of wear or tear.  Lexus typically builds bulletproof cars and I'm betting the IS follows suit. Service is pricey but rarely needed. "

"pv2","March 2008"," Hi,Have you thought about the Acura TSX? Also, the base TL may be in your price range and, though it's bigger, the gas mileage should still be good. I drive a TL-S and am very happy with it, but gas mileage is middling. Good luck. "
"blueguydotcom","March 2008"," Cooper's been fantastic. 1 year and no real problems (DSC would freak once in awhile when I was at stoplights but a software reflash cured that). Otherwise it's just a super fun car. I'm averaging 30 mpg, it's got a shocking amount of useful space, it's perfect for the city, great on long drives and just a joy to drive. I keep checking the value and the car's been a rock too - which was my goal when I bought it. I have an appointment with my BMW dealer to try the 1 when it comes in. I've seen it in person and love the pudgy, aggressive, tall look of the car. My wife's sure we can fit a baby in the back easily but I'm not sold. Still, I'll take one for a spin (ideally a 128 as I don't see the value in the 135 yet). "
"blueguydotcom","March 2008"," Consider the GTI too. It's not as stylish or as upscale feeling as the A3 but it's got a taller cabin that makes entry/exit easier. Downside, it has a smaller trunk and slightly cheaper feel. A 2007 4 door GTI will be a bit cheaper to about the same price as a 2006 A3. It's a better handling car but the soundproofing isn't quite as good. "
"fedlawman","March 2008"," Another vote for the TSX here. "
"kyfdx","March 2008"," I know.. it's weird... about 18 months ago, I had an extensive test-drive.. Didn't notice the problem.. Then, at the car show a few weeks ago, I realize that I can't get in and out of the car... GTI? no problem... A3? no go..I'm not over-sized, either.. 6' 215 lbs.. in normal proportions (if you like beer bellies...) "
"blueguydotcom","March 2008"," Maybe the seat was pushed too close? I could see that happening though as that a-pillar has a rake to it with a close b pillar.The TSX is a great car. I think it's a wonderful value. My wife hated it. She felt in automatic it was a dog and not sporty enough. Shrug. I still think it's a nice car for the money.Gotta admit I smile when my wife says she wants a sway bar on her A3 and tells me she thinks better rubber would help too. "
"kyfdx","March 2008"," No... that was my first thought: Someone left the dang seat all the way up.. So, I backed out, and checked... it was all the way back.. It was just like trying to get in my own car, when my wife leaves the seat pulled up.. I can't figure out how I took a 30-minute test drive, and drooled over it for another hour, without realizing that before.... although, my beer consumption is way up.. maybe, that is having an effect on my midriff... :surprise: I love the TSX, as well...

"nyccarguy","March 2008"," Saying Audi's service is HORRIBLE is being nice. My Mom had an '02 A6 3.0Q w/ Tiptronic. The transmission shifted so harshly and there was a dangerous amount of lag between the time you hit the gas and the car decided to move (like a week). We brought it to the dealer numerous times during her 3 years lease for the problem and we got the ""they all do that"" or ""the transmission has to learn how you drive"" or ""we were unable to replicate the problem"" responses. Besides having to wait 3-4 weeks for an appointment, we actually made an appointment for the Audi Rep to come and drive the car. The guy literally backed it out of the parking spot, drove maybe 10 feet and pulled into another spot and looked my Mom straight in the eye and told her ""there's nothing wrong with the transmission."" Numerous calls to Audi of America showed they don't care a lick either. Anybody in the Northern NYC suburbs, Avoid PALISADES AUDI like the PLAGUE.After her 3 year Audi Fiasco, she switched to an '05 530iA (given how much my Dad LOVED his '04 X5 3.0iA) and loves BMWs now. She got a 328xi when the lease on her 5er was up.The 328xi is a really nice car. Even with the slushbox and AWD, the 3er has a nice amount of giddiup.HAve you driven a Twin Turbo 335i yet? My Dad got a 335xiA as a loaner car while his '07 X5 3.0si is in the shop and all I can say is WOW! I'm sure a 135i must be that much better. "

"plekto","March 2008"," Just be aware of how large the turning radius is on the TSX. It's almost 40 ft!An IS250 is 33.4ft. It's an astounding difference, especially when you are parking. the TSX feels like you are parking a Buick. "
"shipo","March 2008"," It is an engineering trick to allow for a good turning radius on FWD cars. While there are exceptions to every rule, it is generally easier to design a RWD car with a tight turning radius than a FWD or AWD car.Best Regards,Shipo "
"plekto","March 2008"," The Corolla is 35.6ft, or about 4 feet smaller.A Buick LaCrosse is 40.4ft., versus the TSX at 40.0. Something's just off with the engineering on it. "
"cdnpinhead","March 2008"," As Shipo says, generally RWD cars enjoy tighter turning circles. However, my source (can't remember what it was at this point) says the TSX turning circle is 38.1 feet, the same as my RWD Lincoln LS. The old (two years ago) BMW330 is all of two feet less, at 36.1. I show the FWD A3 at 35.1, the best of all the cars I've been considering, most of which are RWD. OTOH, my comparison matrix (yes, my screen name is apropos) shows the IS250 at 35.5 feet, not the ~33.5 foot number you cite.Either way, CV joints take a real beating in FWD cars at the extremes of steering-wheel travel, so there is probably a longevity benefit to not allowing them to go as far as they might otherwise. God knows, Hondas (& Acuras) last forever. "

I am averaging 23 mpg (calculated, computer says 24-25) and I accelerate rather briskly and the freeway portion is at a median speed of 80 mph. I imagine that if I drove slower or acellerated easier I might get 2 mpg more, but nothing is worth going slow. :PI recently fueled up near the freeway, did a hard acceleration to get on the main road, then another hard run on the on ramp and then drove about 8 miles at 80 mph and saw an indicated 28 mpg, clearly the stop and go takes it's toll on my commute, and it's only 1/3 of the miles.

Also do yall think with the new options on the '09 models that are being discussed on this forum (AWD and more horsepower) it's worth it to get an '09 or just get the '08.P.S.---I live in Louisiana so front wheel drive is not a problem (we don't see snow but every 10 years, lol).

"johninnj","March 2008"," Sorry if we differ (I've always though the Q was about the most ignored performance sedan ever for the record) 70-80 mph on New Jersey Turnpike would ALWAYS yield very high 20's or low 30's in the TL with auto...and I have a pretty heavy foot.

"scottm123","March 2008"," Can I chime in? :blush: My short list was the IS250, the Acura TL and the G35x.I drove the IS250 and although fit and finish was outstanding, the size was a deal breaker for me, since I had a 4 yr old daughter who had to be comfy in the back. The lack of power had me worried about the novelty wearing off as well.That brought me to the TL and the G35x.I had to really weigh the pros and cons to come to a decision. Honestly, both are awesome cars and you can't go wrong with either one.For me, the G just gave me a feeling that the TL could not. The dealer, where I bought my 06 MDX, gave me a TL loaner on 7 separate days... one being a Type-S as well.As much as I enjoyed them (especially the MPG), I got bored with them.The G (for me) is WAY more fun to drive. It has more power and I felt more in control of the G as well. It offers more feedback (in a good way)I now have AWD when I need it (It's fantastic in the snow!) and RWD performance at any other time.Also, I found that my right knee hits the center console in the TL and my left arm, which I like to rest on the window edge, was uncomfortable. The window edge was too high and the arm rest was too low.The ""Studio on Wheels"" stereo in the G is more enjoyable and I also feel that the fit/finish/ level of luxury in the G is higher than that of the TL. I love the look of the real rosewood trim in my car and how it contrasts with the black interior.I also have absolutely no rattles after 14,000 miles and one year of driving.Again, this is all personal preference.I liked both cars, but the G just did it better for me.

"irvine555","March 2008"," Thank you scottm123, that's exactly what I was looking for. The 3 cars you named are the exact 3 I'm looking at right now. I currently do not have any children, but I do hope to start a family in a few years, so that does factor in.I think like you said, I won't know what car is right for me until I drive them.I graduated from LSU (Geaux Tigers) last year and got a pretty good job. I've been driving a Toyota Corolla for 7 years now, so any car I choose should be a significant upgrade. "
"blueguydotcom","March 2008"," Wow, I'd call the response of a 184 ft-lb @6000k+ rpm of IS250 a wee bit lazy compared to the 207 [email?protected]~2k rpm of the A3.To each his own. "
"sjaieve","March 2008"," If you want performance, dont even think about the IS250, there are cars that perform way better than that car. However, if you are talking luxury appointments, you cant go wrong with the IS250. Lexus poured its heart into that cars fit & finish. Reliablity is great on the IS as well. "
"louiswei","March 2008"," Oh yeah, there are definitely cars that perform way better than the IS250. Just to name a few: M3, RS4, Cayman, 911...However, with the 70.4 mph through the slalom that puts the IS 250 ahead of the BMW 335i, not to mention about a half dozen very capable sports cars.Granted the IS is no 3-series but it's funny that people are trying to make it sounds like a Camry.Source: Follow-Up Test: 2007 Lexus IS 250  "

"activex111","March 2008"," I think this is not really a fair comparison. A3 and R-8 and M3 and IS250, they dont fall in same league.. I was looking for ""Affordable"" fun to drive luxury car, that's why A3 and IS250. I agree that A3 has a punch to its drive, but practically everyone shares that the Audi dealer service is bad, including my own test drive experience .. May be Audi has a special program, ""How to treat your customers like crap!!"":O). apart from the drive, if are going to keep the car for atleast 2-3 yrs, then the whole experience counts (pouring oil, dealer visits etc).. I checked IS250 again and again and the rear seat looks more tighter to me every time ) I usually dont have passengers in my car but, the rear space almost looks like it i made for kids, thats why i am leaning towards A3 now. Saw a 2006 A3 for with 30K miles for $24K and a 2006 IS250 with 35K miles for $27K.. Granted R8 must be much more fun, but it wont be when you sign that monthly payment check My quest (still....) continues.. "
"louiswei","March 2008"," But hard to beat the 4.8 to sixty. Wait, I thought the straight line performance isn't all that important in a sports sedan... "
"louiswei","March 2008"," Yes, the IS250's rear seat is REAL  tight, to have adults sitting in the back on any trips over an hour would be a pretty terrible idea. However, since my rear seat is normally unoccupied about 99.9% of the time that's really not an issue for me.My suggestion is that make sure you think about this thoroughly, if the tight rear seat bugs you then just turn around and look for something else. "
"sjaieve","March 2008"," ""Oh yeah, there are definitely cars that perform way better than the IS250. Just to name a few: M3, RS4, Cayman, 911...

Choosing btwn the IS250 and the A3 is not going to be easy though, cos one has better performance and the other has everything else IMO "
"plekto","March 2008"," How is the RX-8 not a entry-level performance sedan? (luxury being mostly artificial leather and fake wood trim on any of these, I don't consider ANY of these ""luxury"" cars).Oh wait - you're actually going to claim that the IS250 actually has a useable middle rear seat? These cars are plainly built to fit four people, which is what the RX-8 does as well. And none will fit a linebacker in the rear seat, so I fail to see that point, either. The rear seats are there for kids and the occasional third adult in these small sedans. It's not a coupe, either - that's visual trickery. There really are four doors on it. I'd recommend at least driving it. Mazda's lack of positioning it properly or marketing it well aside, it's .1 second slower than a Porsche Cayman and is virtually identical on the track. For half the price. There's just nothing that comes close to it in its price range as far as performance goes. But it's like Hyundai or Volvo if you want to go back even further. People gave Volvo no respect for decades and then they came out with the 850 Turbo. And it blew the doors off of everything in its price range. Yes, it wasn't a Mercedes. Nobody who owned one cared - they were too busy having a blast driving them.$29K on and IS250, $32K on a 328i, $28K on an A4... or $24K on a RX-8. CarsDirect Price: $23,843(including delivery). That's an enormous amount cheaper than the competition. You could load one up with every last option offered and still not be at what a bare-bones IS250 goes for(no leather, either).CarsDirect Price: $28,710 - IS250. No HID headlamps, no heated seats, no sport suspension, no ... (don't even gt me started on the A4 in base trim) Add that stuff in ad it jumps to $33K almost instantly.CarsDirect Price: $28,408 - RX-8 GT/+ rear spoiler. If you want more bling, you have to start adding chrome and after-market accessories.$5K out the door cheaper buys a lot of gas.(5pmg difference is roughly 7100 gallons to make up at 3.50 a gallon)It's also the same reason a Prius is a no-win situation versus a Civic. 5mpg difference for thousands more in initial price is going to take you well over a decade to recover. Maybe two. "
"louiswei","March 2008"," you will have a tough time trying to convince anyone that the IS250 performs at par with any of the ELLPSThen don't, let the number speaks for itself...Except for the straightline acceleration I think the IS250 can hold its own against any other ELLPS. "
"shipo","March 2008"," Wait, I don't get it. Why are you taking shots at me? I like the RX-8, a lot, and I think that the IS250 is a total poseur sporting sedan that is numb to drive and has such a small back seat that I wouldn't even subject my 14 year old to it for a trip to school. The only reason why I was dismissing the RX-8 for this thread is that the OP is trying to decide between an IS250 and an A3.Best Regards,Shipo "
"louiswei","March 2008"," The RWD, sports package, stick shift IS250 is a poseur sports sedan while the FWD, automatic A3 is not?Interesting... "
"sjaieve","March 2008"," As far as I know, the IS, 3 series, Infiniti G35, Acura TL & Audi A3/4 use real leather. On the 3 series you get leatherette if you want and they dont try to hide this. I believe only the Acura TL does not use real wood otherwise every other car above uses real leather. If you are going to include the Mazda why stop there, bring in the Hyundai Azera, Dodge Charger, etc. I think the reason the Mazda is left out is because its not ""generally"" considered to belong in the same group as the cars I included above. Or put another way, people aspire to drive a BMW, an Audi a Lexus, I am yet to come across people who aspire to drive a Mazda "
"riorebel","March 2008"," Honestly, there are some good reasons you might choose the TL over the G35, but my main reason was my wife. She has a strange dislike of most Japanese cars, particularly Nissan (I think it goes back to one bad experience with a Sentra we had about 10 years ago.) When I took her with me to drive the G35, she hated it - a biased opinion, I'm sure. But I have to admit that it is a bit smaller than the TL, and I also like the slightly better mileage and the look of the TL better, as well.By the way, I am a HUGE Bama fan and I was pulling hard for you. Way to geaux, Tigers! (SEC fans learn to stick together here in Big Ten country!) "

Nobody wants to say, look at a Hyundai Tiburon or a Volvo S40T5 or whatnot most of the time. It's their money I guess, but as I pointed out, the price difference buys a decade's worth of extra gas and then some(140K miles or so for 5mpg difference!). The smart money is to ignore the inflated bling-mobiles where you're plainly paying through the nose for their products and instead start looking at the alternatives.Honestly, I'd rather own a blinged-out WRX than a base 328i with pleather and that miserable base engine. You can always add leather to a car, or a sunroof, even after-market if you have to, so you have to think really hard about the following question:- Is the car primarily an entry-level luxury or entry-level sportscar? IME, when people talk about this segment, bling is of far lower importance than the performance. It's always ""I got a BMW and yeah it has leather and some nice features(revs the engine and grins)"". Not, ""I got this C Class and yeah it is sort of sporty"" :P So ignore the bling and badge. Find a nice sportscar and add the bling in. Almost every maker has silly levels of luxury and bling as packages these days. You'll find that the field widened considerably. "
"sjaieve","March 2008"," You know what, you just described a lesson I learnt the hard way. I bought one of the luxury brands I noted in my earlier post, it had the base engine and had lots of toys, real leather, real wood, almost everything. That base engine was crap, I mean everybody from Honda Accord to Honda Civic Si was faster than me in my Luxury brand. I learnt that the engine comes first with a car, then consider the luxury component. I sold the base luxury sedan recently (after one and a half years of onwership) and got a 3.5 litre, +300hp luxury brand. Now I am happy.I left out the names cos I dont want to seem as if I am bashing the other car cos other than the engine, that car was awesome "
"cdnpinhead","March 2008"," "". . .a base 328i with. . .that miserable base engine.""Interesting phrase to apply to that particular powerplant. I've never seen anything that comes even remotely close in its ability to illustrate the ""different strokes for different folks"" concept.Let's see, scalpel or chainsaw?Both cut, and one is certainly faster.

"kdshapiro","March 2008"," How is the RX-8 not a entry-level performance sedan?

What Edmunds considers a luxury carPeople gave Volvo no respect for decades and then they came out with the 850 Turbo.And Volvo still doesn't get respect.RX-8 appeals to a niche audience. The back seat is unusable, while in the IS250 it's barely useable. Unless you're driving pygmies around all day. The RX-8 gets you Mazda service, while the IS250 gets you Lexus service. The RX-8 wins as a better track vehicle, the IS250 with AWD wins as a better street vehicle. The RX-8 has to be revved to the moon to get horsepower. If 100% of your driving is on the track, I agree RX-8 wins. For the rest of us.... "
"kdshapiro","March 2008"," You are not the target market for a 528 either  "
"sjaieve","March 2008"," No I will never buy the 528, Lexus GS350 is a far better car IMO. Infiniti M35 is also a better buy for the price. I canr afford those cars though  "
"kdshapiro","March 2008"," M35 is also a better buy for the price.The 5 has been the consistent sales leader in this segment. Maybe BMW is giving the people what they want, although I can certainly understand why this car isn't for you. "
"laurasdada","March 2008"," Back in '05, my final two were the TL and the G35x. I chose the TL because the TL offered (imo, of course):Smoother, quieter ride. G had a bit too much road/wind noise. And while the engine growl is kinda lovely, I just heard it too much. Better styling, both exterior and interior. Higher quality interior bits and pieces.Better mpg (child of ""gas crisis"" '70s...)I didn't really want the added weight/complexity of AWD. I'm a lifelong New Englander and skier, FWD has just done me fine (until the TL! Another story, but get snow tires...)Of course, this was Gen 1 G35. Fun to drive, powerful and I'm sure had I chosen it I'd be all smiles. But, my priorities ruled in the TLs favor. And I still dig it!As Gen 2 G is an improvement, just test drive the heck out of each of 'em. No wrong decision will be made. Also, note that a new gen TL is just down the road... "
"blueguydotcom","March 2008"," Or put another way, people aspire to drive a BMW, an Audi a Lexus, I am yet to come across people who aspire to drive a MazdaThose people who aspire to drive an Audi or BMW or Lexus must not have access to autotrader or used cars? Average sale price of cars is 30k. A 3 series moderately outfitted can run less than that. Audi's go in the 20s. Shrug. With the explosion of 30k+ SUVS and Crossovers, I doubt anyone really aspires to drive a Lexus or Bimmer. "
"sjaieve","March 2008"," Yes you are right, the 5 sells almost twice as much as the GS or the M35. I think you present a good argument that BMW is giving people what they want. I cant dispute that, the sales support this. You took the argument to a segment I am not very familiar with, as I said before, I can't afford the car in that segment, and my comments will not really hold water, but here goes.For 52k, I can get an almost fully loaded GS350. For the same amount, I am not going to get the same options in the 528, now, given that the GS350 is faster than the 528, I think the Lex is a better buy. I dont believe one should drive a car that is worth 50k and have cheaper cars, run circles around such a car. This to me is totaly unacceptable. If one pays 50k, you need a car that has everything else that the cheaper cars have, plus more. The GS350 gives you that, the 528 does not.I believe BMW makes good cars, but the pricing does not make sense to me, I attribute the higher prices to lack of the economies of scale that Nissan and Toyota has, since their luxury brands share the same parts as the parent company's cars. "
"blueguydotcom","March 2008"," Wow, someone called the 3.0 a miserable engine? that's baffling. I miss two things about my BMWs... RWD and that obscenely smooth engine. Nothing like the inline 6 in any other make. Like buttah. "

"nyccarguy","March 2008"," I don't want to get OT here, but have you ever driven a Lexus GS? UGH! Drive a GS back to back with a 528i. You say the Lexus is a better buy. Your car priorities must place emphasis on numb steering, touchy brakes, pillow soft suspensions, and gadgets galore (NAV, Mark Levinson Audio). I'm into a car that drives like it doesn't weigh so much with communicative steering, excellent body control and handling ability. "
"fedlawman","March 2008"," Sure the Lexus is quicker to 60, but who cares. Where's the clutch? What do you do when you have to - god forbid - turn the steering wheel?Why not just get a Buick and save $20,000?There's nothing like a BMW I-6. It may not be quick, but my friend's E36 325ic (5-speed MT) is a joy to drive just for the sound and feel of that engine. Puts a smile on my face every I drive it.These stoplight drag racers just don't get it. "
"blueguydotcom","March 2008"," You can get a 5 series for about 6-7k below MSRP via ED. Add in the $1000 BMWCCA rebate. No reason to pay anything close to msrp on a BMW. So I look at the 50k msrp of a 535i and see 43k (including shipping and profit). Add in leather and sport and you're at 47.5k. A 535i with those options has an MSRP of 55k. So, when it comes to shopping for BMWs there are good shoppers and there's everybody else...  "
"circlew","March 2008"," I learned that lesson long ago. I always opt for the top engine available in the model line. Served me well so far.As for the lesser HP, not everyone uses it so in this case, BMW is a different animal. The US cars I've owned and driven needed the top engine because the base available was SERIOUSLY underpowered....not so with BMW. The power difference is marginal.Regards,OW "

"irvine555","March 2008"," Thanks for the info riorebel and laurasdada. When the time comes for me to choose (end of the year), I'll probably test drive each one once or twice and then sit down and write my own positives and negatives and then choose. In the end, it doesn't seem like I can go wrong with any choice I make though. Question: How much of a diff. is there between the TL compared to the TL-S with regard to how smooth the car rides, handles, etc. Also how does the G-35x compare to its other models the G-35 Journey, etc.My girlfriend is the same as your wife riorebel, she hates all American cars (except the Corvette) and she hates Toyotas. I think the hate for Toyotas stems from her having a bad experience with a Corolla (her first car) like 10 years ago (I think it was a '92). She doesn't even want me to look at Lexus. On a side note, my parents have been buying Toyotas for the past 10 years and love them. My mom drives a '97 Avalon (bought brand new in '97), and has only put 32,000 on it in the last 10-11 years (she just pretty much goes to the store and goes home).riorebel, thanks for the SEC support. Honestly I cheer for every team in the SEC except AUBURN. As much as BAMA fans hate AUBURN, I would have to say LSU fans are right behind yall on that hate. Yall look to have a promising year (thanks to good recruiting), so good luck this year, except in Tiger Stadium. "
"sjaieve","March 2008"," Agreed. I want an automatic car, as many bells and whistles as I can afford, power thats above par, in this day and age 300hp does the trick, no need to be competing with a nissan altima V6 in a 43k 528i. Driving dynamics that were described in other posts are a matter of opinion. I will stick with facts here, the engine used in the Lexus 3.5 litre engine is in the wards top ten list, together with the 335i's engine. If you buy a 528i cos of driving dynamics, more power to you, I will buy the faster car, you can stick with your driving synamics behind me I am in my late 20s, so gadgets are pretty important "
"upstatedoc","March 2008"," LD,I could have written that post. Back in '05 I felt the TL was just a little more refined with the G being more rough around the edges.

Point being you, like me are into the engine output as wellIf I buy a GS350 (again, I cant affors it  ) is it not true that its going to have more gadgets, more power, more modern interior (the keyless thing among other things) than a 528i. Thats got nothing to do with stats but is the reality. The more I pay, the more I need, that includes power and everything else that comes with it. Driving dynamics is something I will define, I will not let anyone else define it for me.Driving dynamics is a point you can raise for the comparison btwn a 535i to a GS350, there the dynamics come into play, certainly not for the 528i. I can assure you the driver of the GS350 is going to feel pretty good smoking that 528i  "
"billyperks2","March 2008"," I am not taking sides here with the BMW fans because my next car will possibly be a GS 350.I just wanted to share this experience with you in regards to horsepower, I had a 2003 Acura TL Type S which boast 260 hp.My friend has a older 528I that has 198 hp and everytime we race he was down on my tail.You would think that a 260 hp would blow the doors off 198 hp bimmer.My point is, its not only hp that dermines a car's speed, its the torque, gear ratios, weight, driver etc etc.Another remarkable example- I saw a Mazda Miata beat a Ferrari and Porsche on Motorsport TV last Saturday-expalin that to me?

"scottm123","March 2008"," Also keep in mind that your question will be answered with more people leaning toward the TL, being that you are asking within the TL thread.I like the TL enough that I still pop in here from time to time, but me and my love for the G can't stand a chance against all these TL lovers.Ask the same question in the G forum and you'll get the exact opposite response.I still like these guys in the TL forum... even with their less than perfect choice in vehicle. :P  :blush: "

"sjaieve","March 2008"," Look at the 0-60 & quarter mile times of the 528i and the GS350, The GS is still faster. I am just calling a spade a spade here.There is a general tendency for the X28i to be overrated, yes its a BMW but its not the real deal, the real deal is the X35i. I have respect for that car, its fast and if you tell me its got better driving dynamics, heck, I will believe you. In addition, you probably paid more than anyone else driving the ELLPS so you deserve to be faster. It boils down to the ""more money I pay, more I need"" argument. With the kind of performance you get for the X35i, the lack of other options available on other ELLPS becomes petty. Not on the X28i though "
"kdshapiro","March 2008"," There is a general tendency for the X28i to be overrated, I'm not defending the X2.8 but clearly this is your humble opinion. I agree specificially with regards to you, you should pay more for more horsepower. Everybody doesn't think like that and BMW recognizes this. "
"shipo","March 2008"," I think that you are entirely too caught up in straight line acceleration, and if that's your only yardstick, go buy a WRX and be done with it. There are plenty of people who would consider the x28i over the x35i, and for many reason, me included. When I leased my 2002 530i I made the conscious decision NOT to get a 540i (or an M5 for that matter). Why? Because the 530i was plenty fast enough for my needs, wants and desires. I don't constantly need to prove my manhood by blowing every slammed Honda away at every light, I buy the car for me. Period, full stop, the end.Some time in the next year I'll be buying a new car, and the top five contenders are as follows:1) Audi 2.0T 6-Speed S-Line (via European Delivery)2) 2001-2003 BMW 530i Sedan 5-Speed Sport Package3) BMW 328i Coupe 6-Speed Sport Package (via European Delivery)4) BMW 328i Sedan 6-Speed Sport Package (via European Delivery)2) 2001-2002 BMW 540i Sedan 6-Speed Sport PackageNotice that every one of those cars can be had with a bigger/badder/faster (and thirstier) engine. FWIW, the only reason why the 540i is on the list is that I really like E39s with a stick shift and lots of other goodies, goodies that are often hard to find in the 530i but yet seem to be on virtually every 540i from that vintage.Best Regards,Shipo "

WRX is not my piece of cake, in fact I was in a friends 400+ hp Pontiac GTO and that car is certainly not my piece of cake either, although its way faster than a 335i. Given a choice btwn the GTO and the 335i, I would take the 335i even if its more expensive.I agree speed is not everyone's concern, like I said, I want everything I can get for my money, that includes power, toys, luxury. I only consider cars within the ELLPS though, thats what I drive "
"jmess","March 2008"," I have been driving a C6 for 3 years and I hear you about speed. This car is wicked fast and I almost get tired of having to constantly monitor my speed. I tend to find cars that I can follow at a respectful distance just so I will keep the speed down. With the traffic flows where I live there are very few chances to really feel the speed and I have done the club racing game already. I am currently looking at moving to a wagon, possibly a 328i. It sucks getting old and becoming more rational. "
"riorebel","March 2008"," Actually, I admitted that my main reason for buying a TL-S over a G35 was my wife's taste. That doesn't sound very fanboish to me. That being said, I am very happy with my choice, and I don't regret it in the least. "
"blueguydotcom","March 2008"," Let us know how you like it. The 328it fascinates me because of its more utilitarian shape while still offering RWD and a manual. "
"nyccarguy","March 2008"," Well, sjaieve settled the discussion. He's looking at cars and he prefers the straighline acceleration and plethora of gadgets in the Lexus compared to the ""base model"" 528i. You're in your late 20's and want a GS? My late 20's weren't THAT long ago (I'll be 32 in April) and I didn't want anything as big, heavy, quiet, and burdened by a slushbox car like the GS. To each his own. Good luck! "

"sjaieve","March 2008"," I really want to end this but just felt I had to respond to this. If you read all my posts I said I cannot afford a GS350 so I have never looked at buying one but someone posed the question if I would consider a base 5 series, and I said never. There are better cars e.g. the GS350 cos it gives more bang for the buck and I dont buy base models anymore etc etc etc. I drive a car in the ELLPS segment, my money follows where my mouth/posts is/are. We can repeat he arguments all over again but lets move on. I cant convince you in as much as you cant convince me.Now how about the A3 or IS250 comparison. I still insist its a tough choice "
"cdnpinhead","March 2008"," ""Like buttah.""Yes sir, yes sir, three bags full.I've owned two straight sixes in my life, and both were wonderful. One was in my 240Z and the other was my Cummins 350.

"sjaieve","March 2008"," Agreed 100%. 335i is still a much better car IMO than the GTO irrespective of the HP difference. Like I said, I have respect for the 335i, I might not buy it but thats besides the point. "
"chirocat","March 2008"," You should also ask yourself how you are going to use the car. If you are going to be using it on the track vs a daily driver. Then ask how you drive, some of these cars have very little torque and have to be revved to get average acceleration, as I get older I find it more irritating. Last December I narrowed the choice down to a TL-S, a G35, a CTS-V and a few others. I went with the TL-S and it's pretty much the perfect daily driver. Sure I notice the torque steer and it may only do the 1/4 mile in 14.1, but I can't really use all of that on a daily basis anyway. The other stuff, it's amazing Honda reliability, compliant ride, and upscale interior make daily driving pleasant. The slick 6 speed manual is a joy to row and the engine has enough torque that I can dust 95% of the cars without even engaging the V-Tec. The best part is that despite a heavy foot in the city part of my commute and a median speed of 80 mph on the freeway, I still average 23 MPG. I have just over 3k miles so the mileage might even get better. It's hard to beat this combo. If it was RWD it would be even better. Next year they are talking SH-AWD but I doubt it will have a manual box, so my next car will probably be a 335 or similar. "

"lockgiants","March 2008"," Personally I think that, although they are in the same entry level class, both the G and TL serve slightly differenet markets, and the choice should really depend on what you want. I bought a TL for a simple reason: value and location. I didnt want a rear wheel drive car since im in chicago, and a fully loaded G35 w/ awd would have cost me 36k. and to those who argue the opinions here are biast, i actually liked the G better, but i simply could not say no to a fully loaded tl for 31.5k (with 2k back). if youre someone who is willing to pay extra for the power, the G or the IS350 are better options. but the TL is a much quieter ride, and has much more bang for the buck. not to mention the fuel economy is better, especially with gas at record highs. but like most say, you cant really go wrong with either. "
"pat","March 2008"," how 'bout we back to these cars now? "
"chirocat","March 2008"," I really liked the G35, the studio on wheels is a nice concept and the compact flash slot was a better idea than an Ipod jack IMHO. The biggest complaint I have with the G35 is the pathetic lack of overdrive in 6th gear. My previous car was a 98 Maxima and it was tiring having the engine at 3300 rpm for my entire freeway commute. The G35 gearing was almost the same, whereas the TL-S is much more relaxed on the freeway, cruising well under 3000 RPM (2750). A few milder negatives with the G was the lack of smoothness in the clutch and some vibration in the shifter, and the insurance was also a good chunk more, at least with my company(interestingly, the R32 was the most expensive). I added all these together with a lack of enthusiasm for a good deal and the TL-S got the nod. I probably would have loved the G35 too, and might have taken it if the gearing had been better. Either way, you can't go wrong, they are all awesome cars. :shades: "
"scwmcan","March 2008"," Actually it's the entry level luxury sedan thread, not a TL thread, so there should be a balanced opinion, that said the one to buy is the one he like best, there really is no wrong answer.Scott "
"pat","March 2008"," This started out in one of the TL discussions. I moved the thread here.  "
"adamr001","March 2008"," I test drove a lot of cars before I chose the G35. The TL was one of them. My main complaint about the TL was / is FWD. The car has all the usual FWD problems and didn't handle being ""upset"" in mid-corner nearly as well as the RWD cars I tested (nor as well as some of the other FWDs (9-3) either). I liked the car, I liked the price, but I couldn't get past the FWD and handling.If you test drive a G35, make sure and test drive one with 4-wheel Active Steering. Seriously. The difference between a Sport and 4WAS-Sport still amazes me. Some of the other cars I test-drove were:Lexus IS350 : Only complaints, rear seats slightly too small, no Manual Transmission option, otherwise this was the ""best"" car I drove from an overall perspective.BMW335i : Excellent car, but it felt a bit soulless. It didn't leave me just drooling and wanting to get back in and drive. I can't really explain it better than that. I just didn't wow me.BMW328i : Not in the same ballpark as the other cars I drove. Lacks the power.Saab 9-3 Aero : FWD again, but otherwise this was a fun car and was 3rd in my ranking.There were a few more, but they were more sport than luxury (WRX STi, VW STi, etc.)Ultimately, it's all about what you want.I wanted (in order of importance)4 doorsSportLuxury interior + toysManual TransmissionThus I chose the G35.

"scwmcan","March 2008"," My applogies to the original poster then.Scott "
"bruceomega","March 2008"," ... The biggest complaint I have with the G35 is the ... lack of overdrive ...FWIW, The Infiniti web site says the 2009 FX-35 / FX-45 are going to have a 7 speed automatic. It's probable that will (eventually) work it's way over to the M cars and G cars.Bruce "
"jeffmo2334","March 2008"," I thought I'd chime in here, since my main decision was between the TL and G35.I have been a Honda guy, so at first was not even considering the G35, and so was looking at the TL, especially considering the great deals that were possible considering the desire to clear out the 08's before the 09's came in. A friend recommended I look at the G35's, so at first I just went to the dealership and looked at them (on a Sunday so I couldn't test drive one), and I thought the looks and interior were very impressive looking, and so decided I would consider it.I test drove the TL (not type S) and, while it was solid, I was not swept away. I was a bit disappointed with the low-end power and responsiveness. I then test drove the G35 and was blown away with how the engine performed. Very responsive, and I like the way the transmission adapts to the driver's driving style.I thought I'd end up paying a lot more for the G35 given the incentives offered on the TL's, but actually found that the G35 incentives were even better, assuming you are financing a large % of the total cost of the car. The 2.9% financing for up to 63 months (incentive until 3/31) saves me about $2000 vs. the 5.24% rate I could get from my credit union, plus this month they have added an additional $500 cash rebate, for a total ""incentive saving"" of about $2500, greater than the TL incentive. Also, I was able to get a deal for slightly below invoice even before the incentives, so ended up with the exact car I wanted (Journey with Premium, no nav, wood trim, garnet ember with charcoal interior) for $32,150 or so, and considering the financing deal, over the length of the payments the cost is the same as buying a car at $30,200 and getting the 5.24% rate. This is not far from what I could get on a TL, even with the model changing, and this way I get a car that is a new body design (as of 07) and is the car I like better.Anyway, I think both cars are great, but I prefer the G35. My main issue was the engine's performance and exterior styling.Jeff "
"shipo","March 2008"," That won't help those of us who are manual transmission bigots. Best Regards,Shipo "
"shipo","March 2008"," You might want to consider fuel economy given the price of fuel these days. The TL is well known for delivering decent fuel economy in spite of its powerful motor; the G35 not so much.Best Regards,Shipo "
"circlew","March 2008"," Excellent post! Enjoy your new ride!Regards,OW "
"jeffmo2334","March 2008"," Good point on the fuel economy. The G35 seems to average 17-19mpg in mixed driving, while the TL is in the low 20's. I think the 5-speed automatic has something to do with that, since even on the highway it revs at a pretty high rpm.Jeff "
"jeffmo2334","March 2008"," Thank you, I am! :shades: My wife was against the purchase (gas mileage/cost) until she actually drove the car. Now she loves it and wants to take it (instead of our 07 Odyssey) whenever she runs an errand without the kids Funny thing, since a few weeks ago she always wanted to take the Odyssey out on errands (instead of my previous car, a 1993 Geo Prizm) :P "
"adamr001","March 2008"," Well my observations are that even with the 6mt gas milage is determined by how often you keep your foot on the accellerator. If you can avoid on/off your milage will increase. It doesn't seem to matter (again, anecdotal evidence) if I accellerate hard or soft. It's the simple matter of accellerating that consumes the fuel. If I maintain speed / cruise milage climbs immediately. "
"shipo","March 2008"," To be sure, for any given car, if you keep your foot out of it, it will deliver better fuel economy, however, some cars are still more adept at getting better mileage than others, and in this class of cars, the G35 seems to consistently deliver the worst fuel economy.Best Regards,Shipo "
"adamr001","March 2008"," Oh, I didn't say that it didn't. The G35 is more sports car than performance luxury sedan.It's just that I can make my G35 hit 20mpg in mixed driving or I can make it hit 17mpg. All by how I keep my foot on / off the pedal. On the highway, under cruise, I have no problems hitting 27mpg. Without cruise I run about 23mpg. To be sure, the G35 isn't a fuel efficient vehicle. "
"jeffmo2334","March 2008"," I think that all who look into this issue will unanimously agree that the G35 tends to get worse gas mileage than the TL -- by 2-3 mpg or so. One must weigh this into the decision they are making -- if an individual likes the G35 better, they need to ask themselves whether they like it ""enough better"" to pay a little more for gas.I drive about 800 miles/month, so for me the difference of 2-3 mpg means about an extra 4.5-6 gallons of gas a month, which at current prices here in Houston ($3.20/gal for 93 octane), is about $14 to $19 a month. For me, I liked the G35 at least that much more than the TL, so I don't mind paying the extra gas $$. Even if gas goes up to $4/gallon, the difference will be $20-$24 per month, and I am still OK with that difference. If all else was equal and I liked the TL just as much as the G35, then I would clearly have chosen it for the better gas mileage.Mileage is definitely a factor to consider, and each individual has to weight each factor by their own relative utilities.Jeff "
"shipo","March 2008"," Yeah, well I guess my comments were colored by the fact that I often drive 800 in a single week (with 500 being typical). There is no doubt that if the montly mileage isn't huge, even gas for a Hummer won't be significant. ;-)Best Regards,Shipo "
"jeffmo2334","March 2008"," Yes, driving that much, the price difference is much larger ($50-80 a month or so). But the thought of driving my G for 500 miles a week makes me smile! Jeff "
"alltorque","March 2008"," I wonder if the choices/preferences posted here will change once you guys get the full range of Euro/Japanese diesels. Will the modern torquey oil-burners sway you away from your current picks, I wonder ? M-B, VW/Audi, BMW, Volvo etc have some excellent diesels. My favourite is possibly the Audi 4.2 V8 TDi as fitted to the Q7 SUV - 322bhp and 561lbft according the mag I'm looking at. Or you could have the VW 5.0 V10 from the Touareg @ 309bhp/554lbft but I'd still go for the 4.2.Would be interested in your views. "
"adamr001","March 2008"," Doubtful, for me at least. Diesel pumps are harder and harder to find in the city. Easy to find in small towns / on the highway, but hard in-town. When I had a Cummins I routinely had to travel 15-30 minutes out of my way to get fuel. Not keen on doing that again. "
"shipo","March 2008"," I'd buy a BMW or Audi diesel in a heartbeat. I've driven them in Europe and and entirely impressed, especially in their abilities to accelerate from say 20 mph to speeds of well over 100 mph. Forget the issue of fuel availability, if diesel cars start becoming popular (and I predict that they will), gasoline stations will increasingly start offering diesel as well. Case in point, of the three closest gas stations to our house, none of them carried diesel when we moved here in 2002, now they all do. Why? Well in our area, diesel trucks pickups and SUVs are quite popular as are VW TDIs and Mercedes-Benz E320 diesels.Best Regards.,Shipo "
"circlew","March 2008"," Heck, you must have a few million miles on you by now. Does your better half logg in that high as well? I'm at about 300/week but my wife is a SAH mom but surprisingly she drives 200/week jockeying kids all day.Regards,OW "
"circlew","March 2008"," Shipo, will you consider one for your current consideration or is your buy decision closer. I was thinking 335d when it comes over toward the end of the year. What do you think?I was pondering it but wanted your view.Regards,OW "
"blueguydotcom","March 2008"," Not shipo but I must say the 335d is very attractive to me. well, all diesels are. Gas here is $4 a gallon for premium. Diesel is about 20 cents more a gallon and the same station is a quarter of a mile from my house. If I can get 30 mpg with a diesel 335d v. 22 mpg with a 335, it's an easy call.$2100 a year for diesel and $2700 for premium. The diesel may cost more upfront but for me the idea of stopping less often is also really attractive. As prices go up, the savings will increase too. So if I'm looking at $5 a gallon in 2010 (seems reasonable to assume), my savings increase by hundreds. "
"shipo","March 2008"," Wifey and I have a combined million and a half or more miles, so yeah, she racks them up pretty quickly as well. Regarding the 335d, if rumors are to be believed, the 335d is only coming over here with an automatic transmisson. As you know, I am a manual transmission bigot, so no dice on the first incarnation of a 3-Series diesel over here. Best Regards,Shipo "
"gooddeal2","March 2008"," Yeah, well I guess my comments were colored by the fact that I often drive 800 in a single week (with 500 being typical).If I put 800 miles/week, I will be worry more about the depreciation than the gas. 800 miles/week x 52 weeks = 41600 miles/year = a lot of depreciation. I rather buy a small/sport economy car (~18K) instead of a luxury car. "
"plekto","March 2008"," I've come to the conclusion that the best car for the OP is actually none of the above.He wants something affordable and sporty and luxury, that's also reliable and gets good gas mileage. Unfortunately, they stopped making this car 2-3 years ago, but that's fine, because used like-new examples run about $20K.Get a Mercedes C230K Sedan with manual. This is the *4 door* sedan with the 1.8 supercharged engine in it. It was the exact same model that they sell in Europe(slightly larger engine) and is actually fairly reliable. Mercedes makes two types of cars. Cars and Taxis/Rentals. The way you can tel the difference is if it comes with stick-shift, since 90% of Germans get a license that allows them to drive manuals. If you are one of the 10% that gets an automatic-only license, you are literally laughed at and considered to be a child driver.Mercedes puts no effort into their fleet sales and models, and especially their automatic transmissions. Just enough to get by and no more(S class aside of course). This is why an E class, well, *is* a Taxi in 90% of the world. And it's why their SUVs suck. They are made for basically U.S. markets and taxis.(see a pattern? heh)In Europe, it's all about the A, B, and C class. Manuals are the norm and diesels are better. The closer Mercedes you buy to this sort of vehicle, the better it will drive and last.In Europe, it's called the C200 Kompressor and is a great car. Unfortunately, you have to go back to the previous generation in the U.S. to get that engine.Of course, the BEST Mercedes is this:C 220 CDI 4-cylinder 190 hp 460 NmIf we got this over here, it would obliterate the entry-level segment. 460Nm is an outrageous amount of torque, and 190HP is equal to the IS250. All while getting 30+ mpg.http://autocar-show.blogspot.com/2007/06/first-drive-experience-mercedes-c220.ht- mlBummer we can't get it here...****Now, if you're looking for automatic(sigh), get couple of year old IS300. This car has the IS250's looks and feel, yet is lighter and lots more powerful, plus it has a nice I-6 engine as well. It'll blow the doors off of a new IS250 or A4 in overall driving, and is somewhat useable in the rear for kids.Note - while the IS300 was good, it honestly reminded me exactly of the Volvo 850, but with RWD instead of FWD. It had a very ""European"" feel to it. Something abot the balance and suspension and size and all the rest - it felt better than the base 3 series.The Lexus messed up. they made a compromise version that's honestly not any better than the stuff GM puts out, and they put a mega-speed transmission and a V6 in the IS350 in a quest for power, when all it did as turn it into a muscle car.Remember, the original luxury performance sedan was... a BMW 2002. Light, agile, and well rounded are musts. Bloat, muscle-car power, and in search for a purpose... that's most modern cars.Or you can get a classic.  There's no shame in driving a classic car. "
"louiswei","March 2008"," they put a mega-speed transmission and a V6 in the IS350 in a quest for power, when all it did as turn it into a muscle car. For some reason MB agrees with Lexus' strategy as they are doing exactly the same thing with the new C-class. "

During the 21 months that I serviced that client I put on just shy of 80,000 miles in spite of the fact that I was occasionally traveling and it sat in the garage.I'm now in the market for a new contract, and the two companies that seem to be the most likely candidates will have my mileage drop to a more normal 15,000 to 20,000 miles per year. Assuming one of those two actually happen, I'm thinking the 2009 Audi A3 (which will have the new ""clean-sheet design"" EA 888 engine), with a 6-Speed manual of course. The only rub with that car is that it is ""wrong wheel drive"", however, it does sport a spare tire well complete with a donut spare (but room for a full size wheel/tire), a jack, real GFTs, a dip-stick tube for checking/changing the oil, and room in the back to schlep around our new mutt.The flip side is that the company I was with for those 21 months is, A) talking of giving me another juicy contract, and  has moved their offices some 20 miles further (each way) from our home. If I end up back there, geez, I'm thinking either a new Honda Civic EX-L 6-Speed or a 2009 Jetta TDI 6-Speed, cars I can put 100,000 miles on in two years and not suffer too much from the depreciation.Best Regards,Shipo "
"nyccarguy","March 2008"," I'd buy a BMW diesel in a heartbeat if I were in the market.

One of my customers has a Freighliner Sprinter with an MB CDI engine in it and you can barely hear it idling from 5 feet away.By the time I'm ready to pickup a new car for me, BMW will hopefull get their wits about them and offer a diesel with a stick shift.

The one I drove was a rush compared to the 255 hp 330.The diesel twist is very tempting also but I need to get a better handle on the drive difference on the power curve vs. each variant. Once the fuel savings is measured vs. price and driving pleasure I can make a move after testing each one.My next monkey wrench is the 1 series thrown into the mix!

Cool! check this out;http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/hot_lists/high_performance/performance_files- _tested_by_c_d/2006_bmw_330d_road_testWhen I was looking for car last year I was a total manual trans biggot and actually sneered audibly at any ""performance"" sedan on the lot that had an auto. :PI only considered 2 cars that were not manuals; a R32 with DSG, can't call it an automatic if it doesn't have a torque converter though, and a pre-owned C55. The badass V-8 in that Q-ship almost made up for the lack of a clutch. :blush: Hopefully America will pull it's collective heads out and realize diesels are not what we saw in the crude 80's gas conversion crap? IMHO all trucks 3/4 ton and over plus large SUV's should all be diesel. If we had more diesels, maybe the price of the damn gas would come down because they would have to refine more and can't artificially keep the price up with that old ""supply"" rhetoric. "
"circlew","March 2008"," I knew you had at least some satisfaction form the E90 bloated version of what you would consider the ultimate sports sedan. More than my eyebrows raised with the torque numbers. I gotta try that equation for myself.My problem with test drives is the limited feel you get from driving a few miles. The 335i I drove for 1 day ~ 40 miles was much more of a drive to understand the car. It's an easy sell for me because the extra weight doesn't bother me as I am accustomed to US fare, sloppier handling and control. Stepping into the '06 3'er did it for me. Now if I can get 30 MPG, it just depends on the cost trade off of a lease verse the efficiency gain.Regards,Ow "
"pcampos","March 2008"," I don't have much experience buying cars (I bought a new Corolla in 1987, drove it for eight years, then bought an Accord which I've driven ever since). I've decided I want to get something nice. Situation: I drive about 8000-10,000 miles a year. For the next three years I don't want to spend more than around $300 a month on car payments. After that, I'm going to be in a far more flexible financial situation and will be able to afford a very expensive car if I want to go that way. So I'm considering the following options: leasing something for around $300 a month for 36 months, or buying something used but fairly nice in the the 12K-15K range, and then trading up three years from now. So far I've looked at the Acura TSX and the Audi 3 to lease, plus a five-year-old SAAB 9 to buy. Thanks in advance for any feedback! "
"blueguydotcom","March 2008"," Buy used. A used TSX will run well, serve you nicely and in the end you'll have something, unlike a lease. "
"pcampos","March 2008"," I've noticed the TSXs don't seem to depreciate much at all in the first 2-3 years. I also understand that a redesigned model is coming out in a couple of months. So maybe I should be looking at something around five years old? It's tempting to lease, which I've never done, but since I'm a low mileage driver and am pretty easy on cars in general maybe it makes more sense to own something used for three years and hope it doesn't depreciate much in the interim.

"cdnpinhead","March 2008"," "". . .Acura TSX and the Audi 3. . .""Since I decided I could tolerate FWD this time around, I ended up looking at exactly those two cars. Since the RWD choices may improve over the next few years, I wanted something that wouldn't depreciate horribly over a 3-4 year period. I went with the TSX, and that'd probably be your best bet as well -- Audi depreciation is nothing to write home about. Going used, as has been suggested, is the only way to keep the payment as low as you want it.Honda depreciation is amazingly low; I'm shopping for a car for my mother-in-law, and Civic vs. Corolla used car prices have to be seen to be believed. A 1-2 year older Civic with 40-50K more miles sells for the same money as a newer much less used Corolla. Audi isn't even in the same ballpark.You'll enjoy either car, by the way. The TSX is working out nicely; it's meant to be an interim solution, but if I bond with it in a big way, I may still be driving it in 8 years, as I did my last car. I've driven rental A3s in Europe & really loved them. I did serious Audi research, going back seven years, as a result.Let us know how this turns out. "

As close to 3000lbs as possible.An emphasis on handling over straight line performance and HP.Buick is:FWD.Automatic only.Nearly 4000lbs.Insanely powerful and overbuilt.It's a muscle car. Is it any surprise considering what company made it? GM groks muscle cars, after all.Compare it to a Impreza, RX-8, or GLI. (yes, these aren't luxury, though they are the essence of sporty).

I remembered the Viggen has 155mph top speed too and most 9-3 can go beyond 145mph (4 cyls turbo vs. Buick's...).A lot of cars have very high top speed but not all of them can be driven safety and stable at that speed.

The standard, normally aspirated engine is a little light on low-end torque, but it moves the car around smartly and provides slightly better mileage. The new twin-turbo engine provides the kind of acceleration formerly associated with the high-performance M3, launching the 335i coupe and sedan to 60 mph in close to 5 seconds flat. No matter which model you choose, the 3 Series' world-class suspension, steering and brakes will provide hours of entertainment on twisty two-lane highways. Beyond simply feeling rock-solid when hustled around turns, this car communicates with the driver in a manner that inspires confidence no matter what kind of driving you're doing.

And FWIW, Buick consistently ranks at the very top of JD Power and Consumer Reports quality and reliability surveys. Actually reminds me of the Honda Accord. Not directly, but the Accord is one of those cars that, while not a sports car, just feels right when you drive it. The controls, the feedback, the view, etc. It's just a car that feels good. Maybe the LaCrosse is like that? You've got to admit, it's nice to finally see an American car company making such great strides to improve quality and appeal. The LaCrosse and Enclave, the C6 Corvette and CTS, the G8, the Malibu - all nice cars with nice interiors, good looks, and solid performance and quality - they actually compete with imports on a level playing field.I won't buy an American car yet (the last burn still hurts), but in 5 years, at the rate they're going, maybe I'll have another look.Anyways, the majority has spoken and I think it's time for us to let the Buick thing rest.

"louiswei","March 2008"," Well, I installed the Eibach springs because I want the lower stance and better handling. I've got them for almost 2 months now and I am happy so far with the performance and the look. With the springs the body roll has been dramatically reduced, the artificial stiffness feel has been replace by a better (or should I say normal) stiffness feel and the steering response also improved slightly. Upon installation, the suspension actually felt softer than the stock setup but once it's settled down after couple weeks, that ""softness"" was gone. Kind of weird but other users have also reported about this.I've lowered the front by 1"" and rear by 0.8"". It's a mild drop.Here are some pictures with the Eibach springs: "

I had front & rear SUSPENSION TECHNIQUES sway bars installed in my Prelude a few years ago. For a little over $500, they make such a difference. "
"louiswei","March 2008"," Thanks nyccarguy and fedlawman, The lower stance definitely gives the car a more aggressive look. One thing I like about the Europeans such as the 3er and C-class is that with the sports package, the cars are already sit at a lower height than their Japanese counterparts.Last time I checked, now I am at at little over 27k miles. You are right about the suspension modifications and I think my next task will be adding strut and sway bars to the car. "
"circlew","March 2008"," I was wondering if someone could check my math. Here goes:335d = 30 MPG 36,000 miles @ $4.19/gal = 1,200 gallons = $5,885335i = 23 MPG 36,000 mile @ 3.19/gal. = 1,565 gallons = $4,993These prices were tonights prices for diesel at an Exxon station vs. premium at an independent in Central NJ.Assuming there is a premium price 335d vs. 335i, the diesel is a mute point!Correct me if I am wrong.

"subearu","March 2008"," That would require the price of those fuels to remain constant for all 36k miles.

Maybe as more people get diesel vehicles. :confuse: -Brian "
"fedlawman","March 2008"," I just filled up with Premium tonight and paid $3.69/gal23 MPG 36,000 miles @$3.69/gal = 1565 gallons = $5775.Of course, I'm not sure why, but I only average about 19 MPG with my little 4-banger... :blush: "
"blueguydotcom","March 2008"," Wow. Diesel in San Diego is $4.09 and premium is $3.79 near my house. For me, diesel is a savings compared to a normal bimmer (about $400 a year at current levels although gas will surely get more expensive).. "
"cdnpinhead","March 2008"," Well, for starters, when I use your numbers I come up with $5028 for the oil burner vs. the (almost) same number you got for the gas. However, I'd submit (as have others) that a $1 delta between premium gas and diesel is an unusual situation, at least anywhere I'm likely to travel.Besides which, I neither need nor want a 335d. I'd buy a 2.0 or 2.5 tomorrow if they were available over here, and my experiences in the UK and Europe is that I'll get closer to 40 mpg than 30 with either of those engines. Now, if we were to re-run the calculation with a $0.50 delta between the two fuels and 33% less consumption for the diesel, I think that will be a more useful number, at least to me.However, to support your point a bit, diesel has nowhere near the demand flexibility that gasoline has. The trucks, locomotives, heating plants and other users of diesel and similar fuels (jet A for one) will keep right on consuming pretty much regardless of price, while passing the added expense along in the form of higher prices for whatever goods are being transported. As we've already seen over the past few weeks, when gasoline prices go up significantly, people use less -- it's discretionary to a much larger extent.Should be interesting to see this play out. "
"circlew","March 2008"," NJ has the cheaper gas but in any market, the premium vs. diesel price advantage makes me wonder regarding the premium cost of the d vs. the i.Regards,OW "
"sls002","March 2008"," From the British website:335d has a combined rating of 42.2 MPG (imperial)335i is 31 thus one computes 853 gallons of diesel vs 1161 gas (premuim I suppose) for 36,000 milesfrom the AAA price for NJ I get $3.393 for premium and $4.038 for diesel. ( not imperial gallons though)adjusting for the size of the gallon (div by 0.8) premuim is $4924 and diesel is $4306There are a number of diesel engines that are smaller and use less fuel. "
"shipo","March 2008"," Around here (New Hampshire) in the land of no natural gas availability, our only three options to heat our homes are: 1) Electric, 2) Propane, or 3) Fuel Oil. Typically I see Diesel prices peak relative to Gasoline between December and March. During those months Diesel usually hits thirty to forty cents higher than Premium Gasoline, however, during the summer months, Diesel often gets a dime or so cheaper than Regular Gasoline. While I've never plotted it, my SWAG is that (around here at least) Diesel averages out to be about the same price per gallon as Premium on a year-round basis.Best Regards,Shipo "

"sls002","March 2008"," Perhaps the point of the diesel is that you would reduce your consumption of petroleum by about 25%. The side effect of more diesel vehicles is that diesel will be more expensive which offsets the cost savings one might expect. "
"shipo","March 2008"," As I understand it, when crude oil is refined, there are a number of different fuel grades that come from the distillates of various weights. In a typical barrel of crude oil the fuel grade distilled byproducts work out to the following rough percentages:1) Gasoline: 51%2) Fuel Oil (home heating oil and diesel): 15%3) Jet fuel (kerosene): 12%4) Still Gas (unrefined natural gas?): 5%A couple of points: - As I understand it, the above percentages cannot be varied by much. - As the demand for petroleum based diesel fuel rises, there will be a commensurate rise in the production of gasoline. - I've ""heard"" that one of the reasons (beyond taxes) that allows gasoline to be so inexpensive here in the States is because Europe consumes so much diesel. - As the demand for diesel fuel rises (as a percentage of fuel required for passenger cars) it stands to reason that the price of gasoline might actually drop.Please understand that I am no expert in this area and I'm just throwing the above factoids out there to generate some discussion.Best Regards,Shipo "
"alltorque","March 2008"," I have just filled up Volvo S6 D5, (here in U.K.) Converting for US Gallons and Dollars it works out to $8.35 per USG. Unleaded gasoling computes to $8.12.

"sls002","March 2008"," It is possible to ""crack"" the oil and make the molecules into other products. Heavier into lighter (fuel oil into gasoline). Fuel (diesel and gasoline) can be made out of coal too, at a cost of about $45 per barrel. While not profitable when crude oil is less than $50 per barrel, it should now be very profitable.The point is that a barrel of crude oil can be refined into almost any combination of useful products. In the winter more fuel oil (like diesel) is made. In the summer more gasoline is made. If the entire barrel were made into one product, it would be mostly synthetic (that is manufactured) rather than natural. Breaking down the heavier molecules into lighter ones is not too expensive but takes some energy. "
"alltorque","March 2008"," Apologies - case of ""I've seen it - ergo, so has everyone else"". I have now given myself a good talking to. :blush: It's on another Edmunds Forum : ""Diesels In The News"". The actual post number is 5167.Hopefully my comment will make more sense once you've read that post. "
"shipo","March 2008"," ""Breaking down the heavier molecules into lighter ones is not too expensive but takes some energy.""What about the reverse? I know that gasoline for instance is a light distillate that is extracted from crude oil by simply heating said oil up to ~150 C. Once the gasoline is distilled out, half of every barrel is already gone. The heat is then increased to about ~200 C and kerosene is distilled out; increase the heat again to ~300 C and you get diesel oil, and yet again to ~370 C and you get home heating oil. Increase the heat beyond the ~400 C mark, you're extracting lubricants, paraffin and asphalt.So, are you suggesting that if the chemistry set is fancy enough, diesel can be made out of gasoline?Best Regards,Shipo "
"shipo","March 2008"," Thanks, I'll take a look. Best Regards,Shipo "
"circlew","March 2008"," So you are saying the demand is a factor over the grade of fuel produced. As demand goes up in the states for diesel consumption, Shipo's point is well taken that the price for gas would follow a lower demand/price. I think another factor is the efficiency and demand of the truck diesels which are a large percentage of the US domestic commerce. If public transport demands more diesel, the price will rise. Simple.I know the economy is there in Europe but it remains to be seen how the US model for diesel plays out. Interesting to say the least.Regards,OW "
"shipo","March 2008"," ""I know the economy is there in Europe but it remains to be seen how the US model for diesel plays out. Interesting to say the least.""As I understand it though, the European market (a market that uses similar amounts of diesel and gasoline) needs the American market to continue consuming gasoline so that their diesel prices stay relatively stable. If it is in fact true that more than three gallons of gasoline are produced for every gallon of diesel, then if the world suddenly switched to diesel cars, there'd instantly be a HUGE glut of gasoline on the world markets. Yes, no? :confuse: FWIW, I've long been a strong advocate of diesel engined cars, however, if it does turn out to be true that the percentages of what comes out of a barrel of crude are relatively fixed, I may be driving a gasoline engined car for quite some time (at least until methodologies are put in place for the production of mass quantities of bio-diesel).Best Regards,Shipo "
"cdnpinhead","March 2008"," As my buddy on Rowan & Martin used to say, Verrry Interesting. I was under the impression that the percentages among the four basic fuel groups could be skewed significantly, but perhaps not.If gasoline is the volatile byproduct of making the kerosine (Jet A) & diesel (heating oil) for which there are few substitutes. . .Maybe I'll be keeping my new gas motor longer than I thought, not that that's a bad thing. "
"cdnpinhead","March 2008"," I've also noticed that the UK charges a bit more for diesel than gasoline, but that the better fuel mileage carries the day for the diesel. In Germany, last I was there, the diesel was noticeably less expensive. In Switzerland, not so much -- could have even been more, as in England.I still maintain that U.S. consumption of diesel fuel for cars isn't likely to drive price trends anytime soon, but that it certainly appears to be at the mercy of the rest of the world and the other fuel oil consumers in North America. "
"sls002","March 2008"," Unfortunately the light crude oils where you could distill gasoline out in large quantities are mostly gone and the heavy crude oils that perdominate today are mostly asphalt (oh, perhaps not that bad :P ), but anyway cracking the heavy oils into lighter ones is easy. Making heavier molecules out of lighter ones is more difficult I think, but the problem today is getting lighter molecules. "
"sls002","March 2008"," The seasonal variation in diesel prices has to do with home heating oil, which is basically the same thing as #2 diesel. Cars should use #1 diesel in winter, which is usually a bit higher priced than #2. "
"texases","March 2008"," cracking the heavy oils into lighter ones is easyNot really. Some of that goes on, but not a lot. This is the root of a major problem, the increasing heavy oil fraction of today's production. We don't have an oil shortage, actually, we have a hydrogen shortage, for cracking the heavier oil fractions. And no, refineries are fine tuned to their input crudes, and can vary the mix very slightly once built. Can you build a refinery with significant flexibility? Yes, but that does little for the large number of existing set of refineries. "
"tayl0rd","March 2008"," ... We don't have an oil shortage, actually, we have a hydrogen shortage...We have a shortage of the most abundant element in the universe??? :surprise: :surprise: "
"texases","March 2008"," Maybe better to call it a hydrogenation shortage, but usable hydrogen isn't abundant, either - it's all tied up in water, etc. "
"sls002","March 2008"," I think that you are misinformed. If what you say is true, then asphalt should be getting cheaper, but that is not the case. Here road projects are in some doubt as asphalt has gotten too expensive.However, I will agree that the refinery is tuned to output a certain mix of products based on the crude oil that is available. This tuning is adjusted from winter to summer to increase gasoline or heating oil (basically diesel). "
"texases","March 2008"," My source is a refinery engineer with 25 years experience. To quote:""The current U.S. refining industry has only limited capability to generate more diesel versus gasoline in the short term.In fact, I personally believe the diesel market in the U.S. will not take off like it did in Europe for two reasons:1) Europe's rapid dieselization was heavily subsidized by preferential tax policies vs. gasoline. This type of aggressive social engineering is not as likely to occur in the U.S.2) Europe's dieselization was essentially ""costless"" in terms of refining capital expenditures, as European refiners simply cranked up their excess refining capacity to make more diesel and gasoline, selling the excess gasoline to the U.S.In fact, the U.S. imports roughly 1 Million Barrels of gasoline and gasoline components from Europe every day.In other words, Europe's dieselization was done on the back of the U.S.'s continued consumption of (relatively cheap) gasoline.If the U.S. were to ""dieselize"" in any significant manner, it would require 10's of Billions of Dollars in refining capital expenditures for process units such as Hydrocrackers to shift the product mix from 2/3 gasoline ~ 1/3 diesel to half & half gasoline and diesel.""All of this relates to your statement ""The point is that a barrel of crude oil can be refined into almost any combination of useful products."" Can the mix be modified? Yes. Is it easily varied to create ""almost any combination of useful products""? I don't think so. "
"sls002","March 2008"," The key point being that I did in fact say ""a combination of useful products"", not a single product, such as all diesel or gasoline. The problem today, as reported on the Nightly Business Report, is that refineries are running at an abysmal 82% of capacity. I would hope that the reason for this is not to boost prices, but to switch over to making more summer fuels. "

""Finally, ditch the inline 6 for a twin turbo 4, and lose another 200-300 lbs. Ah, now you've got a fun sedan at 3100 lbs.""Oops, ya lost me there. Why? Well, several reasons actually:1) I'm a fan of smooth engines. The I6 that BMW uses is an engine type that is naturally in perfect balance, meanwhile, I4 engines are natural shakers with considerable second order (i.e. twice per revolution) vibrations. Granted, these vibrations can be counteracted with the use of balance shafts, however, said shafts add needless weight and complexity to the engine.2) like I said, I'm a fan of smooth engines, and in the world of four-stroke engines, unless an engine has at least five cylinders, it becomes a ""push-me-pull-you"" affair with the engine driving the flywheel and drive train during the power stroke of any one cylinder, and then the drivetrain and flywheel driving the engine between each power stroke. With BMWs I6 engine, not only do you get an engine that is in perfect mechanical balance, but you get one that is always supplying power to the flywheel and drivetrain.3) While I don't have the actual weights, I'm thinking that the composite metal blocked engine of the 3.0 liter engine in the E90 325i, 328i, and 330i is rather lighter than say Audi's iron blocked 2.0T. With the I6 engine design, all that is needed for vibration free engine is a block, a crank, and six piston/rod assemblies, With a high specific output blown I4, you typically have to cast the block out of lamellar graphite cast iron (GJL). Once you have the block, in addition to the crank and four piston/rod assemblies, you need to add two balance shafts (and the associated drive mechanisms), a turbocharger or two (and necessary plumbing and intercoolers and such), and a heavy flywheel that can help smooth out the torque reversals from the intermittent application of power.All-in-all, I'm thinking that I'd MUCH rather have a naturally aspirated I6 than a blown I4. ;-)Best Regards,Shipo "

"sls002","April 2008"," I guess I don't see how adding a mere two cylinders transforms an out of balance engine into one that perfectly balanced. While I agree that a 4 cylinder engine probably has more NVH (noise, vibration & harshness) than a 6, an 8 (either a V-type or straight 8 like my grandmothers 50 Buick) should be still better, with a V12 or V16 at the optimum.An inline 6 is better than a 60 degree V6. "

"shipo","April 2008"," Well, whether you ""see"" it or not, it's the truth. Fact, I-6, H-6, V-12, and H-12 engines are naturally in balance for all free forces of both the first and second order, and free moments of the first and second order, and to the best of my knowledge are the only commonly built piston engines that are naturally in balance, and as such, naturally smooth.A discussion of the whys and hows of this balance issue is complex and long winded, and is way too over the top for the purposes of this forum. If you don't believe it, buy yourself a Bosch Automotive Handbook (I have one and it is a phenomenal wealth of information), or you can look at any number of web sites that discuss such things. Here are a few:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_balancehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_enginehttp://www.vibratesoftware.com/html_help/html/Diagnosis/engine_speed_related.htm- - Best Regards,Shipo "
"nyccarguy","April 2008"," I actually first walked away from the car last Sunday after initially looking at it because it was an Automatic. A few voices in my head (roadburner & fedlawman) told me I was crazy. I'm actually going to learn to perform the maintenience on the car myself. Once I get it running well, then I'll swap out the slushbox for a 5-speed.  "
"fedlawman","April 2008"," What, it's an automatic?!?!I missed that part of your original message. Never mind, you shouldn't have bought it. :P "
"sls002","April 2008"," I looked over your references, and while wikipedia is a good source it is not always entirely correct. They commented that straight eight engines did not have OHV which is not correct as the Buick Straight Eight had OHV beginning in the 1930's. I see your point about the straight six, but I still think that a nicely balanced V8 may be smoother running. Most sixes are V6 designs and are not as good. "
"alltorque","April 2008"," It was drummed into me many years ago that the ""smoothest"", i.e. best naturally-balanced engines are 6's and 12's. 4's and 8's will always be less well naturally-balanced. No, can't explain why now but no doubt some of the pro engineers will be able to. Not sure about V6's as we didn't have many of those back in my day but we did have quite a few nice straight-6's; and they were very smooth if not terribly powerful by today's standards. "
"sls002","April 2008"," If you look at shipo's references and follow on with some of the other references you will find that the V6 needs counter balancing to run smoothly. With counter balancing the V8 is very smooth running. I think shipo's point was that the inline six without counter balancing is smooth running, while other engines require some sort of balancing.As I see it, the size of an inline six for any particular vehicle will be limited by how much space is given to the hood length. For the same hood length, a V-engine will take up less space and can therefore be larger than the inline six, for up to 12 cylinders. "
"fphjr01","April 2008"," I liked the comment about how ""an increase in boost pressure should bring the hp from 300 to 355"". This is interesting, considering that many of the available reviews on the 335's performance have indicated that the book 300hp claim is very likely low-balling the actual output.What a perfect idea -- make a 335 tii version, claim that there is 55 more hp than the standard engine (when it's actually exactly the same), and charge $5000 more for the 'modification'. "
"plekto","April 2008"," Inline engines also have much less mechanical complexity. V engines are a design nightmare - angles and extra connecting rods and multiple camshafts and...That adds weight as well. And worsens efficiency. So as a result, you can make a smaller I-6 than a V6 and get the same results. So often, you can fit the I-6 in the car as well as a V6. But GM and Ford never really designed I-6 engines - at least not recently. So they trudge along with their overly complex V engines. BMW and Mercedes started out with inline engines and still use a lot of them.As for the weight, 3400lbs is just about what my 87 Buick Park Ave weighed. That's hideously bloated for such a small car.

Even that amount of power could embarass the cross-ply tyres of the day. All black body, lots of chrome and a carnation pink & white interior, (2 x 3 seat benches), plus valve radio.

"plekto","April 2008"," I meant more parts in the connecting rods. I see it as having pultiple connecting rods since it has more than one part between the piston and the crankshaft.*** from wiki on 60 degree engines***However, more modern designs often use a 3-throw crankshaft with what are termed flying arms between the crankpins, which not only give the required 120? separation but also can be used for balancing purposes. Combined with a pair of heavy counterweights on the crankshaft ends, these can eliminate all but a modest secondary imbalance which can easily be damped out by the engine mounts***So you don't have piston. rod. crankshaft. like in an inline engine. You have a bunch of intermediary parts kludged together to keep it from shaking itself apart.GM's 90 degree designs are even more complex and run even rougher, being designed off of V8 engines. Actually quite nasty, really. They tend to eat through engine mounts fairly regularly. The reason you don't see many I6s is because they usually won't fit in a FWD car due to there needing to be space for the CV joints and transmission as well. Thankfully it is making a comeback as makers are slowly realizing what a giant turd FWD technology is, especially in vehicles with over 200HP. "
"cdnpinhead","April 2008"," "". . .plus valve radio.""I also remember tube (valve) radios in cars -- they took awhile to warm up and really could run down the battery if left on while the engine (with its generator) was shut down. Lots of things have improved tremendously in automobiles over the past 50 years, but many of them add weight.My '65 MGB was lots of fun to drive & own, with the knock-offs, wire wheels, the tightest steering I've ever had and shifter feel that was unequalled. Safe? Not really. Powerful? No. Radio quality? Awful. Still, a wonderful car. "
"shipo","April 2008"," Ummm, I'm thinking that you've grossly misinterpreted what you quoted from Wikipedia. True, most V6 engines use a three throw crank with some form of an offset between paired connecting rods to achieve an even 120 degree firing interval, however, even the 60 degree engines that use flying arms (an arm that reaches between connecting rods and extends from the throw back through the axis of the crank and some distance beyond) have no more complicated connecting rod assemblies than an inline engine. FWIW, flying arms are cast into the crank itself, they don't move independently and other than a little machining to remove a small amount of metal in the balancing process, require no extra work during engine assembly.Actually, when looked at from a part count perspective, V6 crank shaft, crank bearing, and connecting rod assemblies (bearings included) are actually simpler than an I6. Why is that? Simple, your typical V6 only uses four main bearings with a single 2-cylinder offset throw in between each main pair, however, your typical I6 uses seven main bearings with each cylinder having its own throw situated between main pairs. In spite of this difference, I6 engines usually have a considerably lower parts count compared to a V6 of an otherwise similar design.Best Regards,Shipo "

"bfluegie","April 2008"," I&#146;m looking for a new (to me) ride. I don&#146;t have to decide just now, but probably sometime in the next couple of months. I thought I&#146;d post this here as well as on the &#147;help me decide&#148; forum because this seems to be a very active discussion. Some of the cars I am considering do fit this category, so it&#146;s not too much of a stretch. What I am considering is a (probably) pre-owned BMW 325xi (maybe a 330xi if the deal is right, but I&#146;m not too sure I want a turbo), G35x (I have VPP so I might go new for this), Audi A3 or A4 (I like the A3 better but they&#146;re hard to find in the northern IN vicinity), Acura TSX or maybe TL, but it&#146;s larger and I don&#146;t like it as much. I might consider the Altima coupe as well, but not the sedan. While I like the sedan styling more than the Accord or Camry, I don&#146;t like it as much as the Infinity, and the Altima sedans are everywhere. I don&#146;t want to put my car away for the winter, so I prefer all wheel or front wheel drive. That leaves out the Infinity G-coupe (sigh) and the BMW 3 series coupe. I know several people who drive the G coupe and they either garage it for the winter or get adequate but not great driving with winter tires. I prefer the security of good winter handling. I haven&#146;t completely ruled out a small SUV or crossover, but after 8 years of driving an Exploder I&#146;m ready for a more responsive ride. I joke about the Explorer, but with the exception of an unfortunate &#147;Bambi&#148; incident I have never been left stranded. No significant repairs other than normal wear and tear either. It just has over 130K miles and it is time to move on to something else. As long as I&#146;m moving on, I want to add some fun. I won&#146;t be racing or pushing for maximum speed, but I do like the feel of a car that you don&#146;t have to slow to a crawl when going around a curve. I suppose I want to feel like I am part of a driving system rather than the occupant of a vehicle. I would consider a 2006-2007, maybe a 2005 as well. I know the Infinity was a new model in 2007 but I like the previous model as well. The BMW was a new model in 2006 and I don&#146;t know anything about the 2005. I might be overlooking something else as well, so any suggestions for additional cars to consider (or avoid) are welcome. I&#146;m considering a manual in the BMW or A4 but I didn&#146;t like the manual in the &#145;07 TL I drove (the clutch seemed to have a very tiny &#147;sweet spot&#148; and it didn&#146;t help that the salesperson sneered a little when I lurched on a start). I don&#146;t know if the TSX would be any better. The G35X is only available in an auto. Manual vs. auto isn&#146;t a big factor for me so I probably wouldn&#146;t rule out an auto BMW or Audi either. Since I&#146;m going to continue getting older and creakier, the auto might be a smarter choice, just not as much fun in the pre-creaky years. "

The A5 could get me to make an exception, though. Seeing that beauty in my garage every morning could calm a lot of panic.I hadn't considered the Jetta Fahrenheit and I will have to check it out. I have driven the DSG, though in an A3 Quattro. I really liked that car. I forgot the A4 was heading for a redesign. I'll have to check that out as well.

If you get it at the right time, you can save several thousands (usually $3000-$5000. With this economy, there may be more).If you are buying a used European car, you may want to get a certified one.

"markcincinnati","April 2008"," Why pay $5,300 MORE for a car that has a heavier front end, takes more gasoline to propel it and has 15 ft lbs less torque -- and that the torque it does have comes on at thousands of rpm's higher?I had an allroad 2.7T and I had also had three Audi cars with the 4.2 V8 (one A8 and two A6's) -- so when it came time to order the allroad, I test drove another sort of similar car, an A6 2.7T. Torque rules.And in the example above, the V8 had 295 ft pounds of torque vs the V6's 258 ft pounds, yet the V6 was quicker because the torque came on (in the V6) at below 2,000 RPMs and the V8 didn't come up to full boil until north of 3500 RPMs.In this case, the new 2.0TFSI has 258 ft pounds, below 2000 rpms and the 3.2FSI has 243 at north of 3200 rpms -- this is a no brainer.The V6 IMHO is for the consumer who wants to talk about the 265HP V6 (despite its lower torque.)Had Audi offered the engine competing with the BMW 335 i6 turbo, well, that might have been a horse(power) of a different color.I believe the A4 2.0T will be the car of choice for about 10-12 months in the A4 family; the V6 being offered solely for marketing reasons (""wouldn't do,"" to have this car without a V6 in the brochure, kind of thing.)I may, but I doubt it, regret this decision. But the handling, mileage and performance of the 2.0TFSI should be superior in Cincinnati OH (where it will see most of its duty.) It will easily top any speed limit we have in these parts (just as easily as the V6) and its quickness, for a while at least, will be unequaled -- at least until the supercharged V6 comes out in a year or so.Another A6 3.2 certainly was an option -- but the new A4 will have a 110+"" wheel base, the A6 is 111+"" -- the balance, RWD biased quattro, sport package and other amenities and luxuries in the premium plus package makes the A4 2.0TFSI a ""better"" choice for someone who wants CTS style luxury (at least) and very BMW like performance and handling -- in a handsome package.Rationalization?Perhaps -- but there are just too many head to head (A4 vs A6) test reports and reviews of this new A4 to make me wonder ""who in their right mind would pay MORE for less?"" -- and that seems to make the case in favor of the A4 (B8) 2.0T with ""all the option boxes ticked off -- except ACC.""So, we'll see how much under $50K this comes out to be -- and hopefully I will not regret not going with my second choice: the new Infiniti G37X 4 door sedan.FWIW, my dealer says this car should be comparable in MSRP to the outgoing model + about $2,000 for the Audi Drive Select and a ""few hundred"" more for the addition of a backup camera.Time will tell -- and I WILL share the good, the bad and the expensive with y'all. :surprise: "

"jaxs1","April 2008","  If I'm open to look at a lot of different brands, which near luxury sedans have the hottest lease deals for a 15K per mile lease?I'm open to 2 or 3 year leases, but assume 3 year leases will have much lower payments, so I would more likely do a 45K 3 year mile lease than a 30K 2 year mile lease.I'm looking for the lowest combination of total costs (lease payments + maintenance and wear etc.). For instance I know BMWs include free scheduled maintenance, but many cars with ""Sport"" packages and 18"" performance tires can cost thousands extra in 3 years due to tires that don't last long and are ultra expensive to replace.If I were to lease one of these vehicles, I would want automatic transmission, premium package with heated leather seats and moonroof, bluetooth. Must not have low treadlife 18""+ sport performance tires. Factory nav would be a plus if any would still fit the price range even with nav.Can less than $450 before tax be done with $0 cap reduction on any of these cars with that equipment based on realistically available discounts in California?328i, G35 sedan, C300 Luxury, TL, TSX, ES350, are some that I'd like to consider.

"jaxs1","May 2008"," I thought I might need to buy a Lexus for a quiet ride, but I found the 3 series to be surprisingly quiet. Not LS460 dead silence, but seemed about as quiet as an ES to me when I drove it regardless of what any db meters may say.I ended up buying a 328i.From inside with the windows closed, the turn signals are most noticeable noise at times:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaQg8JrzL_c&fmt=6 "
"blueguydotcom","May 2008"," Yep, it's a German Buick. "
"tayl0rd","May 2008"," You must've bought one without the Sport package. I had a 328i loaner last week (non-Sport), and I was also surprised at how quite the ride is. And yes, the turn signal is a little obnoxious. I've driven a 335i Sport and it wasn't very quiet at all. I'd still buy one, though! Amazing how much of a difference tires can make. "
"blueguydotcom","May 2008","  no, the sport package still feels like a Buick. "
"tayl0rd","May 2008"," I don't know if I'd go that far. Even the non-Sport doesn't feel like a Buick. That was my first extended time with a 3-series and I put it through some paces. It handles really well, though it will understeer on you when you start pushing the limit. And the steering's not quite as quick as I like. The Sport package is much better as far as handling's concerned. I haven't driven a 3-series Sport long enough to really test the steering.Here's a strange one for you. I test drove an M3 sedan and it's suspension actually felt softer than my 550i Sport! :surprise: (It didn't have the adjustable suspension.) Go figure! But boy was it precise in direction. And getting back in my 550i after the M3, I could really feel the heft of the 5-series over the 3-series. (Or 550i Sport over the M3, that is.) "
"plekto","May 2008"," Check out the weight of one. Close to 2 tons. The reason it's quiet is because they have added several hundred pounds of materials to dampen it like a Buick or a Mercedes.Handling is nowhere as good as the 3 series a decade ago as a result of being 700lbs or so heavier. "
"tayl0rd","May 2008"," There aren't ""several hundred pounds"" of sound dampening material. The vast majority of the weight comes from safety equipment, amenties, and chassis stiffening/bracing. "
"sls002","May 2008"," The increase in weight is due to the body's larger size (#1) and stiffer structure (#2). The new 1-series is a return to a smaller body, but they are using the 3 series platform so it has the same weight problem. "
"plekto","May 2008"," ""stiffer structure"" means more metal and dampening materials. The safety equipment between 1998 and 2008 isn't actually that different. Maybe 100lbs more, if that, since the older models came pretty much with everything that was available at the time. "
"sls002","May 2008"," dampening materials do not make the structure stiffer, but do reduce noise and vibrations. "
"berad","June 2008"," ""If you are between an A3 and an IS 250 and scratching your head then look at consumer reports.... Only 53% of owners would buy the A3 again - this is the bottom of the barrel. The IS 250 RWD is 78% -- this is near the very top of the list. All in all the odds are that you will be happier with the IS 250.""For what its worth...CR's data has change - the IS250 RWD & IS350 have a CSAT of 78% the IS250 AWD is 72% and the A3 is now 78% "
"blueguydotcom","June 2008"," Depends on the buyer. If you're buying for luxury the IS250 seems like the ticket (and that ticket is very expensive). If you want space for people, utility, power (it's got gobs more than the IS250) and still a small package, then the A3's golden (and priced nicely). Personally, I detested the IS (even the 350) and find the A3 allows us to do everything - pick up passengers, go on a run to home depot for larger items, smooth, effortless power. The handling's not as sharp as I would like and there's road noise from the cruddy all-season tires. Gas mileage, when I drive it, tends to be in the mid to high 20s. Outside of the RWD layout, which Lexus numbed down to the point that the car understeers like a FWD, I can't personally see the value in the far more expensive, less powerful, less useful IS250. "
"jzalkin","June 2008"," I owned an A4 Cab (sold at 56,00 miles) and now have the IS250 (36,500 miles). Here are my thoughts.Quality is a lot better in the Lexus. Forget the big items as the small stuff makes for greater frustration. I always had a few things in the Audi that needed to get addressed every service (broken small pieces, peeling of plastic coating, etc), but not with the Lexus. The Lexus is put together great. I know why they have loyalty because there are so few complaints on the small annoying things as the car ages. I guess that is why there are a lot of last gen Lexus driving around that people love. Service varies, but around South Florida, the Lexus experience is top shelf (better than Audi). I almost never have a list of little things to be addressed at the service intervals.The Audi feels sportier and has a roughness that reinforces that. The Lexus is serene and the quietness/plushness reinforces that. Both get old at times, but you have to decide your preference. I can't compare engines as my A4 Cab was heavy and did not perform any better than the IS250. I get great gas mileage and do not want any more HP in my car given fuel prices. With prices expected to hit $4.50 by end of July (premium - see record oil prices today and stock market plunge) I wouldn't mind giving up even more hp for even better gas mileage. The A3 is more versatile, but can't touch the Lexus for overall Luxury. Plus, the Lexus V6 is smooth and does have plenty of umph when needed. I loved the audi and await the A5 convertible, but unless you carry a lot of things that you need the A3 for space - I think the Lexus is the better choice. I was not inclined to keep the Audi out of warranty, but will not hesitate to keep the Lexus based on my personal experience. "
"carnaught","June 2008"," My experience varies with yours. My GS 400 Lexus had to have two dashboards replaced because of bubbling up of the vinyl. I sold it when a third was required due to reccurrence. My Lexus service rep. called the situation, ""bad product"". An isolated incident? Maybe, but my 1995 LS400 and 2003 Lexus SC 460 had the same problems. The other cars I've owned including the Audis had no such problem(s). "
"blueguydotcom","June 2008"," What year A4 cab? The 2005/2006 came with a 1.8T and a CVT in a car weighing an astounding 3600 lbs while only offering 170 hp/166 hp. The 3.0 with 220 hp/220 ft-lbs jumps to 4000 lbs.Comparing the a4 cab to the IS250 is sorta misleading and not representative of comparing an IS250 to an A3. "

"alltorque","June 2008"," Have three close friends with Audi's. An A8 3.0TDi, (with a gazillion toys fitted at the factory), an A3 2.0 TDi and an RS4 Avant. First two are 2 and 3 years old respectively. The A3 has 78k miles on it without any glitches, (he's trading it next Jan for an Audi TT TDi 'cos he heading for second childhood. The A8 has around 60k miles and has only suffered one glitch - two weeks ago the Audi satnav decided to stop working for 10 minutes whilst driving around the Paris Peripherique, (great place to lose satnav), but came back of its own accord. The RS4 is only 6 months old and no hiccups but same friend also has a Ferrari F355 which seems to go wrong on just about every trip...............to the extent that he's gonna sell it as he thinks the RS4 is a far better-built car, damn near as fast, far more useable and it doesn't attract the wrong sort of attention from the boy-racers or constabulary, (we have a couple of Subaru Imprezza WRX police cars locally which do send out a certain Clint Eatwood-esque message. ""Ya feelin' lucky, punk?"" or perhaps, ""Make my day"". Very entertaining though.Other folk I know who've had Audi's swear by them - not at them. You've either got a :lemon: or folks who don't know what they're doing with the diagnostics etc.On the other hand I have a neighbour with a newish Mercedes C-class and he's either having an affaire with the Receptionist at the local Mercedes dealer or the car really is a dog. Just to balance that a near neighbour has one of the old, squarish, M-B S500's...........the one that just needs a big gun on the roof to complete the Main Battle Tank image, (it's even painted dark green metallic), and with 200k miles up it just keeps going but does have a drinking problem which is starting to hurt with gasoline here, (UK), at the equiv of $9+ per US Gallon.

"shipo","June 2008"," I've driven all three, and in spite of the fact that I value RWD over any other drivetrain, I'd rank the cars as follows:1 - Audi A3 2.0T 6-Speed -- By far the most enjoyable the three to drive, and has the most rear seat space and the most utility as well given the mini-station wagon configuration.2 - Acura TSX 6-Speed -- Fun to drive, lots of goodies (that I don't necessarily care about), and reasonable space in the back seat.3 - Lexus IS250 RWD 6-Speed -- Extremely boring to drive with no ""feel"" of what's going on with the mechanicals or down on the road. This car also suffers from an anemic engine (at least until you wind it up even higher than the Acura's already high strung mill) and a back seat that is all but laughable. In every respect, this car is a very distant third of the three.Best Regards,Shipo "
"darrinzramz","June 2008"," Hi need some answers if possible,I have a G35 sedan 2004,I've been using 87 octane in my car w/no problems at all.Seems to me when gas gauge reads full,I watch the gas gauge over the course of the week,and I notice it stays up near-full for the 1st 85-100 miles I put on the car,then all of the sudden the gas gauge seems to go down quite quickly from there.I'm medium on the gas on occasion I will get on it medium to slightly hard,it seems I'm only getting 15.6mi/gal,does that seem a bit much or not!!!????.Anyways I've change the plugs to a performance plug also I installed a K&N filter,there is no gas leaks what so ever!!!,any suggestions would be greatly appreciated,I also do use my cruise contol also,do mostly city driving though, not alot of stop and go,thanks Darrin Lynch  "
"shipo","June 2008"," A few points:1) Over the decades I've had dozens of cars that were from Asia, North America and Europe, and every one of them has exhibited the same gas gauge characteristics as your car (i.e. the needle is fairly stable for say 100 miles following a fill-up, and then it drops like a rock). This is totally normal as the level of fuel when ""full"" is typically above the top measurement range of the gauge sensor.2) IIRC, Infiniti recommends ""Premium"" gasoline for your 2004 G35 engine (an engine well known for its poor fuel economy by the way), you should check your Owners Manual to be sure. Assuming that's the case, by running regular you are forcing the engine management system to retard the ignition timing to keep the engine from blowing itself to bits because of the low grade fuel you're feeding it. In turn, retarded ignition timing will further reduce the already marginal fuel economy of your engine.3) Given how modern engine management systems work, it is physically impossible for a K&N filter to improve fuel economy. In fact, there is a fair amount of empirical evidence that suggests this type of a filter can reduce your economy.4) Based upon the reports of other owners of your car, 15.6 mpg is not too far out of line for ""mostly city driving"".Sorry I couldn't be more helpful. Best Regards,Shipo "
"ghstudio","June 2008"," The nissan/infiniti engine is one of the really solid engines...it's still the base for the current nissan/infiniti engines. It is not the most thrify on gas, neither is it the worst. It is possible that not using high test is effecting your mileage, but I've tried 93 octane and 87 octane in my 06 M35 and I've seen no difference in MPG or pep. A larger factor is ethanol in your gasoline (unavoidable today) which gives you less mpg then 100% gasoline. I doubt that octane is causing any problem in this engine however you can try three tanks of high test and see if you see any significant difference.Fuel guage is what it is...I think it was the old BMW where they made the guage for the last 1/4 tank of gas almost 3/4 of the guage. It's rare that it matters how full the tank is when it shows full...but it really does matter when you're down to 1/8 a tank.High performance plugs and ""high efficiency"" air cleaners do almost nothing in a modern engine. Actually, most all additives also do nothing, in fact most car makers recommend against using ANY additives in the car. If you aren't driving aggressively, then about the only thing you can do that will really improve mileage is to turn off the A/C. "
"circlew","June 2008"," I have the BMW 330xi and have religiously used premium gas as spec. I get consistent 22 mpg tank to tank. Why you would use low octane on a higher performance engine is foreign to me. My car weighs 3,700 lbs and still gets acceptable gas mileage on standard A/S tires because each month I regulate tire pressure and rotate the tires each 5K miles.Tires last longer, wear even and get the best efficiency as a result.It doesn't take much to get the specified MPG rating for your car if you are aware of the small details.Regards,OW "
"1nickatnite1","June 2008"," I don't know about 04 g35s but with the current ones you cannot rotate the tires. 15.6 mpg does sound low but if it is mostly city driving and since you admit to driving with a ""medium to heavy"" foot it is not that surprising. Best gadget I've heard of for saving gas is the fuel ""mizer?"" (sorry not sure about the spelling) supposedly it will change your driving habits and increase your mileage up to 20%, hope this helps.

"markcincinnati","June 2008"," I read the post you replied to -- and I thought the number of posts pertaining to ""false economy"" would have somehow not been missed by this owner. I figured he must actually WANT to get poorer mileage AND poorer performance.The inside of the filler door, the manual, the dealer techs, the salespeople, this board and a few other places have repeatedly explained about the compensation for lower grade fuel that these engines make -- and, of course, the way that it is handled is as you say shipo.I leave for a few months and then come back for a look see and we're still talking about the same stuff. I find the search facility works just fine -- why would the car require premium fuel, tell you it requires premium fuel and then surprise you when it runs at less than its most efficient?Wonder if there is a ""glossary"" somewhere here that would be like an FAQ page for folks -- sort of like:Fuel requirements Regular, MidGrade & PremiumOversteerUndersteerHorsepower vs Torque: What we buy versus what we say we buyDrive Bias: front, rear, neutral, allNaturally aspirated, super charged, turbo charged, twin chargedAnd so on. . .""Hey doc, it hurts when I do this. . .""Doc: ""Well then, don't do that. . .""

I have never had an engine problem, never a transmission problem (other than the crappy tip-lag issue in the 5 speed auto -- and that was a software issue NOT a defect or hardware problem.)I MAY have had a headlight or tail light burn out LAST CENTURY. I also had brake rotor warping issues in my 2001 A6.My experience with over 2 dozen Audis is, statistically, probably not significant, but as an anecdote, it bears writing here perhaps to balance the ""Audi still has problems. . ."" Overall, I have no evidence that Audi still has problems. My '05 A6, soon to be gone, will be missed. In so many ways it is still ahead, by years, of the newest CTS -- if you could test drive these two cars back to back, the content and performance of the C6/A6 vs the CTS demonstrates this point.

Quiet smooth ride. Dampen road noise.2. Luxury cabin and modern amenities. i.e. soft leather, no cheap materials and someplace to plug my ipod in.3. Power and performance. Doesnt have to smoke everyone on the road or corner on rails but when I need to pass it should respond impressively.4. Back seat capable of fitting a car seat and an adult if needed.5.

"alltorque","July 2009"," The BMW would certainly do your jobs but the 3-series is hardly ""Luxury"". A4 is cramped in the back and the C Class can be very variable on built quality/reliability. No idea about the Acura, we simply don't see them in Europe.A6 or S60 would be my choice..............but I have to declare a bias as an S60 owner, (and a diesel at that). Best seats in the business, nice lines, very well built and typically excellent Swedish safety, (incl child seats). Between the S60 and an A6 would be a hard choice for me but the slightly more distinctive lines of the Volvo would probably win me over - again - after 2 years of enjoyable, comfortable, utterly reliable driving. $22k would buy you an '07 or possibly '08 S60 SE Lux here in U.K. and enough change for a good weekend away...........ditto for an S80 which is even nicer.Ah, but the iPod plug-in would be an after-market fit; but hardly a deal breaker.

The BMW seems to fit the bill in terms of fun to drive and status. Light on luxury and amenities, heavy on price tag and a lot of people have one.The TL sounds like it has a lot of features and luxury, but I'm not sold on the style.

"carnaught","July 2009"," The BMW seems to fit the bill in terms of fun to drive and status. Light on luxury and amenities, heavy on price tag and a lot of people have one.

"bobhoops","July 2009"," I bought a '06 TL in late October for $21K with 23k miles. It is everything you want except having an IPOD jack. I would recommend it as your commuter car as it will be very reliable, it has very good power, and I think it looks great and a great back seat. "
"dash5","July 2009"," Thanks Bobhoops that's a good endorsement, appreciated. Can you tell me if it's a quiet smooth ride on the highway? Really sounds like a contender for me.Well I saw a white, late model TL in the parking lot today. I am guessing it was at least an 06 but possibly as new as a 09. Sharp car, not what I would call distinctive or a head turner, but very nice. Really though none of the cars I am looking at are ""head turners"". TL makes my short list. BMW does as well. Volvo I will be checking the S60's and S80's. Audi I am eliminating because of reliability concerns, which may or may not be justified but I've just heard it too much and I need to eliminate something. Too bad too because the A6 is a sharp car. Benz I am eliminating for now, that will be my gift to myself as a next car perhaps in 5-7 years when I can go beyond the C class. Lexus doesnt seem to have anything I like within my price range. Cadillac... not feeling it. Only other car I'll likely check out is the TSX, not sure what the distinction is between that and the TL but it seems to get very good reviews. "

"markcincinnati","July 2009"," If you can get your choice of one of the cars on your list with the CPO designation -- from the factory -- I would urge you to consider doing so, as the cars on your list are breathtakingly expensive to repair without some kind of a warranty program.I traded in my 2005 Audi A6 (fully loaded and with the V6) and it had 60k virtually trouble free miles on it. Having said that, I would ONLY acquire one (of any of these mfgr's kids) with the CPO designation.PS don't think you will use snow tires on an RWD car and enjoy it as much as an AWD car with all seasons, in most places, that is.

"bastuk","January 2010"," I posted a similar post in the Luxury Performance forum but this is probably more fitting. And it's related to the recent posts by ""dash5"" on entry level luxury cars. I've been driving a '01 Accord EX-V6 for the past 8 years - it's been a great car - the only things I have done are the std maintenance items - brakes, tires, etc. I am starting to shop for ""newer"" used car with less miles as I have 151K miles on it. I am looking at moving up into a more luxury class - looking at Audi A4/A6, BMW 3 or 5 class or Acura TL. Today, I had a chance to drive all of these and in addition a MB. The dealer had a 04 Mercedes E320 and it was awesome to drive and seemed priced ok ($17K).As I have been doing research I continue to find the biggest complaints against the German cars being reliability and the high cost of repairs. Honestly, after reading the articles and reviews, I am reconsidering ""moving up"" and thinking about buying a newer Accord or just moving into the Acura class.A couple of questions -+ Are the repair costs significantly higher with a German car vs Japanese? I have no baseline on my Accord since I have not had to do any repairs.+ Is the reliability that much worse for the German cars than an Acura/Honda? "

I have no baseline on my Accord since I have not had to do any repairs.+ Is the reliability that much worse for the German cars than an Acura/Honda? Over the past 27 years I have owned nine BMWs. In my experience a 3 Series won't be all that expensive to run, assuming that you have a good dealer or independent BMW tech to rely on. Here are the current running costs on my four cars that are used on a regular basis:2007 Mazdaspeed 3- 4.4 cents per mile over 52,000 miles2004 BMW X3 2.5- 2.8 cents per mile over 86,000 miles1999 Jeep Wrangler TJ- 5.2 cents per mile over 58800 miles1995 BMW 318ti- 5.4 cents per mile over 120,000 milesIn 86,000 miles the X3 has needed one warranty repair- a passenger SRS sensor. Aside from that it has needed one set of brakes at 60,000 miles and tires at 46,000. The Inspection II(major) service and a brake fluid flush at 65,000 miles cost less than $370.The 318ti is my part-time track rat(note that its running costs include four sets of track rubber). In the 15 years I've owned it it's needed two sets of front pads and one set of rear pads along with four rotors. I've also replaced the drive belts and idler pulleys, the brake light switch, battery and the thermostat, all of which costs less than $550. My last Inspection II cost $495, and that number included a coolant flush and a four wheel alignment. In contrast, my Mazda has needed major mechanical and suspension repairs- it will soon be replaced with either an M3 or M5. "
"plekto","January 2010"," The problem stems from the suppliers for electronics in Europe that German companies use. With their insane taxes, they are pretty much forced to use Bosch and a few other makers for their switches and electrical components in the vehicle to keep costs down(Porsche doesn't but they also charge the difference and then some).Conversely, most of the better stuff in the world comes from Korea and Japan, so the components that cause the repairs don't fall fail half as often. The trick, of course, is to get a Japanese or Korean made vehicle that isn't full of Chinese and Malaysian and wherever else labor is cheap electrical and mechanical parts. "
"bastuk","January 2010"," How do the normal maintenance costs stack up for German Cars (oil changes, tires, etc)? I know BMW requires synthetic oil changes - not sure if Audi or M-B does either. "

Better hope the computers catch that leak before it goes bad.... :sick: And the shame about it is that while the cars are horrendously pricey to fix and maintain, and the electronics and accessories are crap, the engine and drivetrain in them are some of the best examples of engineering on the planet.For instance, the Mercedes engines are fantastic. But the rest of the car isn't put together any better than a Chevrolet(and for 2-3x the price, it had better be a LOT better in those areas) Don't even get me started on the pleather/MB Tex nonsense...

Now, true, there were cheap aftermarket parts to be had, but I can guarantee that since we're talking luxury and sport sedans and the like here, Lexus isn't going to be ""cheap"" to fix.If you look at the lists from 2008, it shows Isuzu(Chevrolet trucks), Infiniti, Mitsubishi, and Hyundai as taking most of the entire list. Toyota isn't there and neither are any of the European brands.(or Cadillac) edit:If you go back to 2006, Toyota is on the list.

One can bring their cars to a third party mechanic for major work.We are talking what happens after warranty when the tranny fails, water pump fails, alternator fails, o2 sensor fails, fuel pump fails, engine blows up. How much does an Infiniti alternator cost, vs a BMW, vs a Lexus?The first three years, 4 for BMW, are covered by B2B you can take the car to the dealer for warranty work and Jiffy Lube for oil changes. You can spend as much, or as little as you want on service. There are people who are DYI and people who bring it to the dealer.It's when the warranty expires what are the price of the parts and labor, and to even the playing field I'd suggest using dealer rates, not third party mechanics.

But to calculate the costs, one has to assume, either all third party maintenance or all dealer maintenance...except for BMWs.My assertion is after the B2B an Infiniti water pump costs as much to install as a Lexus water pump as a BMW water pump...or at least close enough for government work. "
"jimbres","February 2010","  My assertion is after the B2B an Infiniti water pump costs as much to install as a Lexus water pump as a BMW water pump...or at least close enough for government work. Agreed. This has been my experience with my BMW, which has been out of warranty since the middle of 2005. Here again, our independent mechanic provides the labor, & his rates are obviously the same whether he's working on the BMW or the Lexus.I think that people who say that Japanese luxury cars are cheaper to maintain than their German counterparts have something else in mind -- namely, that the German car is likely to require expensive repairs sooner (earlier in the car's life) & possibly more often than the Japanese car. So while it may be true that the cost of replacing part X is pretty much the same for a BMW as it is for an Infiniti, this part typically lasts for 125K miles on the Infiniti but usually fails at the 90K mark on BMWs. "
"plekto","February 2010"," True. And the electronics are more pricey on the BMW, Audi, and Mercedes as well, which are usually what goes bad first. For some reason, the German electronics firms just make second-rate junk, but they don't change to more reliable Asian suppliers. Actually I suspect the real reason is politics and taxes.I do know that when I owned a Mercedes a few years ago(and a couple of Volvos back before Ford ruined them), they cost significantly more for the parts and often there was no aftermarket replacement for switches, accessories, and computer modules. I think what finally did it for me was when it cost me nearly $30 for a factory shift knob replacement for my Volvo. (don't get me started on stuff like keys)The raw data suggests the following arrangement::1:Infiniti2:Lexus(Toyota is now almost as expensive for parts as Volvo, unfortunately. Their transmissions are a known hugely expensive problem as well)3:4:Cadillac/Acura (they tend to switch back and forth - Acura breaks less often, Cadillac costs less to fix - nearly a tie as a result)5:6:7:8:(all the rest start here)There's a tiny gap between Lexus and Infiniti, then a small one to Cadillac(major improvement in the last decade) and Acura, and then a large drop down to the rest. I think what does it is that it's really Nissan, Toyota, and Honda versus the rest. In Japan, there is only one product line - and the premium models are just that - the upper end models of the normal line. "
"qbrozen","February 2010"," Man, I'm getting confused. The same exact discussion on 2 boards right now. Here and the Luxo Performance board. "
"kdshapiro","February 2010"," Can you back up your ""raw"" data other than the website you mentioned. The internet is great, anyone can say anything and have it be a fact. I certainly, and this is me, would not get an Infiniti thinking it would be cheap to own after the warranty expires. But neither a Lexus or BMW either. How about true cost to own on Edmunds, what do they say? Frankly I'm not looking it up, because your assertions don't pass the wet finger in the air test.edit: I checked TCO. Try it..it contradicts your assertions and is line with some common sense. BMW 328X, Lexus 350, G37X are all within a few bucks of one another. BMW 335iX is $10 grand more...of course the 335 leaves the others in the dust in both performance and TCO. Camry 4c more than $20 grand less. "
"tlong","February 2010"," I assert all of the vehicles are cheap to own for the first three years. Actually, no. The depreciation costs in the first 3 years dwarf the maintenance costs in the out years. You just don't see those costs until you sell. "
"kdshapiro","February 2010"," Owning a car for 3 years and then selling it, might as well lease. One has to assume if looking at these costs one drives the cars until the wheels fall off or at least 5 years. "
"tlong","February 2010"," But still, depreciation is the biggest cost, dwarfing any maintenance costs. In fact, pretty much if you can afford to have a newer ELLPS you shouldn't be worrying about maintenance costs at all, as your big hit is acquiring the vehicle in the first place.

In today's economy even the super-rich worry about their dollars.I love BMWs too - I own one - but I don't think that BMW's ""Ultimate Service"" (their name) program will influence my decision when the time comes to replace my car (probably next year).It might be a tie-breaker for me if I had to choose between a BMW 335i & a comparably priced car from Audi or Mercedes. But I don't particularly like Mercedes & having owned one Audi, which was nothing short of horrific, I'll probably never buy another.It's much more likely that the final decision will come down to a BMW 335i versus an Infiniti G. And the price gap between the 2 cars is so great that the amount of money that ""Ultimate Service"" would save me - $649.40 over 4 years according to BMW's web site - is just laughably trivial.That doesn't mean that I might not buy another BMW, but it does mean that ""Ultimate Service"" won't be a factor in my thinking. "
"tlong","February 2010"," One only worries about depreciation if one is going to sell almost immediately. It is not a financially good decision to buy a car with selling it in three years in the back of your mind. If you are going to do that leasing is available. This is a silly argument we are having. Even if you drive a car for 10 years, if it cost $45K new and $5k in 10 years = $40K = $4k/year in depreciation.If you buy a new Camry for $30K and it costs $3K in 10 years = $27K = $2.7K/year.So the ELLPS is $1.3K/year more expensive due to depreciation. Which is why I'm saying that maintenance should not be a big factor. You would have to average $1300/year MORE in maintenance costs on the Camry PER YEAR to equal the much larger cost of the ELLPS purchase. So the ELLPS is a lot more expensive to own. And that is why even a grand or two every few years in maintenance costs is not that big. It has nothing to do with how long you keep the vehicle. Maintenance is not a large part of the ownership costs. And I haven't even brought up the costs for insurance, etc.So if you like an ELLPS and you can afford it, buy or lease it and don't worry about the maintenance costs, or perhaps you can't afford the vehicle in the first place. If you want a real worry, then the relative risk of breaking down or of time in the shop is probably more important, since that is a convenience issue rather than a cost issue. "
"plekto","February 2010"," TCO has a huge problem with it.1: Depreciation isn't a factor in comparing cost to fix/repair/upkeep a vehicle. Also, neither is stuff like insurance. Yes, it matters, but not to compare which vehicles are the least expensive to keep running(you really only lose money when you sell the car, if you ever do - or to be more accurate, you only GET BACK the difference in depreciation when/if you sell it)2: The first years where the factory warranty is in place artificially skew the results. BMW comes out well by this measure because it does cost you nothing to keep the car running, or nearly so. But try that with a 5 year old BMW...TCO is pretty worthless, really.Just looking at the data I posted - if you go back to 2005, you'll see Lexus is taking about half of the spots. Infiniti and Cadillac vastly improved their quality since then and Lexus slipped a bit down to where Honda/Acura is.(still very good, especially if you get a car with manual)link titleThe problem is that costs to fix things is skyrocketing. A replacement transmission in a Camry, for instance, runs over $3500 now. That's just silly. Bumpers and other components that get scuffed or cracked are hideously expensive. Want to replace a Toyota or BMW or well, almost ANY car's headlight assembly? So if one company can come in with less frequency and/or less cost per part than the competition, it wins. Mercedes, Audi, and BMW flat-out fail here. Volvo is also notoriously pricey to fix. Acura and Infiniti are a bit better, as is Cadillac(they take grief about not using the best newest tech, but then again, that's less stuff to break as well) Toyota just has problems recently and I'd not recommend anything with an automatic or ETC(electronic throttle control) on it from them.(that's 80%+ of their line currently. "
"ivan_99","February 2010"," Want to replace a Toyota or BMW or well, almost ANY car's headlight assembly? Gives me a flash back to last year when I wrote off my Q45 (wasn't that bad of an accident). ONE headlight assembly came in over $1200...ouch "
"kdshapiro","February 2010"," There's that expression again, lies, damn lies and statistics. You get to pick your metric and make your case based on your metric. There is no getting around it, the more expensive the car the more it costs to own.For example: In my area a rebuilt G35 tranny is almost $2K, but a rebuilt Camry tranny is $700. Not sure where you get your figures from. A headlight assembly for a G37 is nearly $800. Ouch.If you are saying an Infiniti tranny breaks less often than a Camry tranny after the warranty period, you would have to point to some credible source for me to believe it. Not just a CR survey.But it still boils down to will *your* car have an issue, and if it does what will it take to repair it. My BMW can be cheaper to own on a parts basis against a used Accord if nothing breaks on it and the Accord is constantly under repair. "
"plekto","February 2010"," I suppose if the rebuilt Camry transmission is a generation or two old and has no warranty and is out of some shop in the middle of the industrial section of town, you MIGHT find one for $700. But here in Los Angeles, a 4-5 year old Camry automatic is well over $3000 by the time you write the final check. The best I could find locally was $2100 with a warranty, not counting labor, shipping, tax(etc) and a core charge. The CTS transmission was only $1600. Now $500 might not be a huge amount to some people, but that's more than I spent last year on maintainance on my 4x4.With that sort of potential repair and the issues that keep coming up(plus the new Prius recall, now!) I can't recommend Toyota other than for their trucks. "
"kdshapiro","February 2010"," Who buys a new transmission? Almost nobody? It must be a regional thing. The numbers I cited were local. It must be a supply and demand issue in the LA area, which is a very narrow slice of information to make a broad generalization on.The other potential reason for the difference is that CTS trannies may be crap, you get what you pay for.I have no problems with Toyota, I would buy any of their cars in a heartbeat, recalls or not, doesn't bother me in the least. I really like the Camry SE and am mulling over buying it. "

"plekto","February 2010"," I guess the reason they are included is because I see Toyota as ""Toyota"", since it's just one company in Japan - with 40 or so different vehicles ranging from econoboxes for the poor to luxury cars and even military transport vehicles and commercial equipment. Also, many of the ""Lexus"" models share DNA and parts with the more common vehicles, which is where the problem is right now. Toyota isn't admitting it, but OF COURSE Lexus models are also going to be affected.That said, manual transmission Toyota/Lexus models are fine. They have no computers in the way and are as solid as a tank. The same can be said tor Mercedes as well. *If* you get a C or E class sedan with manual(yes, I know, only automatics normally make it over here in the U.S.), they are extremely reliable cars. Stripped of all of the electronic junk and transmission and throttle and everything else that tries to out-think you, they are perfectly fine vehicles.Now, the real question I guess is what out there that is a ""luxury car"" doesn't have all of that technological garbage applied to it? I'm unfortunately having a hard time getting any names on my list, as least for stuff that I can buy in the U.S. "

"jtla","February 2010"," As someone pointed out earlier, when discussing maintenance costs, we are not talking about oil change, break pads sort of thing, but repair cost should a car broke down -- and how frequent that happens.In my 3 years of ownership of a 2007 328i, I had to take her in 3 times for ""unscheduled maintenance"". Each and everyone it was due to malfunction of some kind of electronic control unit, and the solution each time was to replace some ""module"". These are repairs that cannot be performed by mechanics, no matter how good they are, not to mention the expensive ""diagnosis equipment"" they would have to purchase. Other than these electronic issues, I never had any problem what so ever. However, it is these electronic problems that keep me from owning another German car because they are notorious on electronic components. I do not want to be in a position where I have no choice but to go to the dealer for repair after the warranty expires. "
"kdshapiro","February 2010"," *You* may see Toyota as Toyota, but there is enough differences between a Lexus vehicle and a Toyota vehicle. That is like saying I see Nissan and Infiniti as one company since the same engine and a lot of DNA is shared between the two companies.Your original point, which is a silly statement, is an Infiniti is cheaper to own than a Camry. I guess as silly as it sounds, if you live in LA it's true. In the rest of the world, it's a laughable thought. "
"plekto","February 2010"," No, I said that an Infiniti is cheaper to maintain than a Lexus according to actual research. And I provided a link for the data as well. "
"kdshapiro","February 2010"," No you provided one link, which I don't believe. Just because it's on the internet doesn't mean it's true. Or maybe it's true by one measure and false by another. Edmunds TCO tells a completely different story. Additionally I dispute your research for indicated tranny prices as my research indicates the exact opposite.Anyone who buys an Infiniti thinking it's the cheapest thing around to maintain is foolish. I could make the statement BMW for the first four years is the cheapest car to maintain in the world and I would be correct and factual. Does it tell the whole story? No. "
"qbrozen","February 2010"," As someone pointed out earlier, when discussing maintenance costs, we are not talking about oil change, break pads sort of thing, but repair cost should a car broke down -- and how frequent that happens. Then we should be discussing ""repair costs"" not ""maintenance costs."" Maintenance is maintenance, as in the manufacturer's suggested maintenance. Not to mention, one person's maintenance is usually not comparable to another's. For instance, I may like to maintain my car by changing the oil every 4k with synthetic, while someone else with the same car may prefer every 7k with off-the-shelf oil.You don't find this sort of variance with repair costs (as long as both go to a dealer, that is).

If you look back 3-4 years, Lexus and Toyota *were* at the top, as you probably would expect. But in the last few years, Toyota has had massive problems with its entire line of vehicles that they've been fairly good at hiding and denying until very recently. It's not surprise that one of the other Japanese makers has managed to move into the #1 position as a result.2009http://www.intellichoice.com/top10/Top_List/year/2009/list/Lowest%20Repair%20Cos- - ts2006http://www.intellichoice.com/top10/Top_List/year/2006/list/Lowest%20Repair%20Cos- tsIt's been a very hard three years for Toyota.

"smarty666","February 2010"," I find this discussion about maintenance costs very interesting since I have a Infiniti, Acura, and MB. Its hard for me to add anything really important or helpful to discussion since in the 6 years I have had each car I haven't had anything but normal maintenance stuff done to each vehicle and no other problems as of yet; in regards to normal maintenance the Infiniti has been the most expensive to maintain because the gas mileage is lower than my Acura or MB and plus it has a larger tank than the other two! air and cabin filters were the cheapest in my Acura to replaceoverall, I think my Acura has been the cheapest to maintain but don't get me wrong, both the Infiniti and MB are not that much more expensive and I've been pretty happy at the amount each one has been to maintain!!! "
"kdshapiro","February 2010"," Pick your metric to prove your point. TCO for a ""generic"" Infiniti G3X is much more than a ""generic"" Camry. BTW I call Intellichoice a rag, which is why I do not believe their metrics. "
"kdshapiro","February 2010","  It's an interesting discussion but what is being discussed has to be clear. As gbrozen stated above maintenance is not repair. You may be of the ilk who likes to change their oil once a month even if you put on 12K miles a year, thus driving maintenance costs up.I am talking about repair, which is after the warranty expires. How much does it cost to get brakes replaced, altenator, transmission, water pump, ECU, light assembly, sunroof etc. A Lexus, BMW, Acura, Infiniti, Audi will have a higher repair bill than a Camry and Honda. This assumes you go to the dealer for service.As long as nothing goes wrong with the car after the warranty expires, oil changes are cheap. The major services run into some money. A friend paid $275 dollars for his 7500 mile service on his Acura. Sure he could have gone to Jiffy Lube and saved a few bucks, but he wanted the dealer experience.A BMW is the cheapest car to maintain because it costs you $0 for four years, but what happens after four years? "
"smarty666","February 2010"," as I pointed out in my post I would not be able to give any insight into repair work because I have not had anything yet fail or need to be replace so hopefully others can help you in that regard!best of luck! "
"billpaul","February 2010"," $275 for a 7500 mile service?I think that is a dealer experience that I could do without. "
"temj12","February 2010"," I recently talked to a Toyota mechanic. There are two dealerships side by side; one is a lexus dealership and one is toyota. He was familiar with both cars. I asked him if there were any similarities between them. He said that, when you get up under a Lexus or a Camry, you are looking at the same car. "
"temj12","February 2010"," Interesting post. Which of the vehicles is the best made? I do not own a German car, but I have always thought that Mercedes was the best built, structurally, of any luxury car. "
"alltorque","February 2010"," Interesting post. Which of the vehicles is the best made? I do not own a German car, but I have always thought that Mercedes was the best built, structurally, of any luxury car.I doubt that MB are even in the top 5 of the ""Any Luxury Car"" category, although they would have you think so. Rolls Royce, Bentley, Bugatti, Maybach are surely top of the heap and then there is a whole slew of builders who would tie for the next places. MB would have the ""S"" class in there but not much else in the past 5-10 years. Here in UK they rate pretty poor in JD Power surveys. Lexus always beats 'em - as do Skoda, and that's a VW cheapo-brand, (although it also beats VW and Audi every time).Then, of course, Maybach is to MB as Lexus is to Toyota. "
"plekto","February 2010"," It's odd, really. Mercedes make the best engines and bodies and car that I know of, but the accessories and automatic transmissions are among the worst. The only way to buy one, then, is manual everything and no options at all and with a manual transmission. They sell these in Europe but not in the U.S.(barring gems like the C230K they made a few years ago)The best built for cars is actually a near tie between Nissan, Mazda, and Honda. Honda gets the 3# place(by maybe a foot behind the others) if only because their prices on parts have gone up in the last few years.For trucks and SUVs, Nissan and Toyota if you get one with a manual transmission, that is. "
"kdshapiro","February 2010"," Best built cars are Porsche. Owners never take repair tools to rallyes.With the exception of the a Camry is more expensive to own than a G37, debating who makes the more bulletproof car is like debating vanilla vs chocolate. Most cars will easily make it to 150,000 miles. I know a few BMW owners north of 200,000 miles.It's what happens after the warranty where it gets interesting. "
"smarty666","February 2010"," only problem is Porsche is by no means of the imagination a entry-level luxury vehicle and the majority can't afford them! "
"kdshapiro","February 2010"," Absolutely correct. Some of the cars we've been discussing aren't quite elps either. But you can almost make the case if one can include a loaded 335, one can almost include a Boxster. "

"roadburner","February 2010"," fedlawman;I might be buying a 54K mile E30 M3. I'm just trying to decide if I should use it as my daily driver. "
"fedlawman","February 2010"," That's a tough one. One the one hand, what a shame to ""use up"" such a low mileage example just commuting to and from work. On the other hand, these cars are not exotic collector cars and they're meant to be driven. There are lots of factory and aftermarket parts out there to keep it on the road indefinitely, so as it ages and wears, you'll never have trouble keeping it in tip top shape. As long as you don't mind the thought of watching it get old and used up, I think it's fine as a DDer. It's funny, I know a couple of people who own E30 garage queens and can't help feeling some resentment towards them because I think it's such a waste, but I also know that if I owned one of those E30's, I'd probably be inclined to ""preserve"" it too. Maybe that's why my 210,000 mile restored M3 is right for me. It looks and runs great, but on close inspection, it will never be mistaken for a show car.Also, I guess I should to admit to you that I don't think I could drive mine every day. I love driving my M3 on the weekends and during the summer, I do drive it to work occasionally just because it's just such a joy on a nice day. Oftentimes though, I'm grateful I have a 4-door slushbox company car for my commute - especially during the winter months. A smooth, quiet ride, with cupholders and an automatic transmission is usually what I want when the weather is gloomy, I'm tired, and I just want to get where I'm going without any drama.Honestly, I wish I had kept my E30 325is when I got my M3. Having both would have been perfect - the 325 is a much better DDer, still a lot of fun to drive, fun to tinker on, and parts are cheaper. It doesn't have to be another E30, but if you can do it, buy the M3 for when you want to drive, but have something else for when you have to drive.EDIT: I guess I didn't really answer your question, did I? Sorry, I'm tired and honestly, I go back and forth about my M3 lately. There's nothing else like it and I love it, but sometimes when the rear speakers stop working, the interior lights fail, or a dashboard panel comes loose, I secretly think to myself that a Cayman S would be so much easier to live with. But that's crazy talk...very few cars are more fun to drive, and none of them have a back seat and trunk. It's really a very special, fantastic car - arguably the best BMW has ever produced. If I ever do part with mine, I'll be forever grateful that I had the privilege and pleasure of owning and driving one. "
"plekto","February 2010"," Cars are meant to be driven. Shoot, if I had a Ferrari, I'd drive it until the wheels fell off. :P "
"kdshapiro","February 2010"," What fed said... "
"temj12","February 2010"," What is the problem with the transmissions? Is it that they don't last or the performance? Is the accessories problem part of the electrical problems that I see mentioned? I have always thought that I would like to have one at some time, but I know the repairs are very expensive. In Europe, they are a fairly common car. Here, they are luxury. "
"plekto","February 2010"," Automatic transmissions live and die based upon their electronics and hydraulic components. Often when the system fails, the oil overheats and cooks the inside or damages something and the entire thing turns into a brick that needs to be completely pulled apart and rebuilt. As, say, opposed to an old hydraulic only design like Ford and GM used to make a decade or two ago - just replace the torque converter 90% of the time for cheap and you're done.($800-$1200 repair vs a whole new unit)Mercedes makes its cars in Europe with manuals only, essentially. They add in an automatic to placate the rental fleets and taxi users and the like. As a result, it's almost like an aftermarket accessory in their minds - just put something in and ship it out the door, who cares as it's not going to someone who cares or can't afford the maintainance. They don't re-design the transmissions for export, and so you get a great car with a Chrysler quality automatic stuffed in it(trust me - the designs are still very similar on the automatics).The only way to avoid this is to buy a manual like 80%+ of Europe does. The problem is, of course, that almost nothing shipped TO the U.S. by Mercedes(or most other makers other than VW) is offered with a manual. "
"kdshapiro","February 2010"," At some point in time for three seconds it might have been true. Clearly Mercedes lost it's focus for a while, but they have been working to get it back. So I say the above statement holds no water as a generality.One could do a search on Infiniti transmission problems and find some stuff. "
"fedlawman","February 2010"," ""They add in an automatic to placate the rental fleets and taxi users and the like. As a result, it's almost like an aftermarket accessory in their minds..They don't re-design the transmissions for export, and so you get a great car with a Chrysler quality automatic stuffed in it.""So you think that the Mercedes 7-speed automatic was an afterthought for the rental fleets and taxi's? I don't think so.Name one domestic car that has a 7-speed transmission. "

Well, I'd still have my 318ti Club Sport as well as my 2002A. I also don't really have a daily commute; my annual mileage depends on how many out of county assignments I receive. And when all's said and done, I don't recall the M3 being any less civilized than my Mazdaspeed...The thing is, I keep reading about how you should get an E30 M3 while they're still relatively cheap- and then there's the incomparable racing heritage. I guess the hook was set back in 1989, when I spent a day lapping Sears Point(Infineon) in a friend's 1989 M3. At any rate, I don't have to decide right away, but I will need to make a call sooner than later. "
"fedlawman","February 2010"," I've never actually driven a stock, low mileage E30 M3. Mine's somewhat modified, as you know, so it's not nearly as quiet and comfortable as I imagine a stock M3 must be. Even so, the S14 has never been described as refined, and even a stock M3 is gonna rattle, buzz, and vibrate all over. I swear, sometimes I think the car is trying to shake itself to pieces. The solution, of course, is to keep the revs above 5000 - my car just sings between 5K and 8K.The right time to buy is when you find a good one. If you've found ""the one,"" then grab it before it slips away (or give me the guys phone number... :shades: ). "
"plekto","February 2010"," The new 7 speed automatic is an attempt at making the problem better, but in reality, like all of these 6+ speed automatics, they end up being hideously expensive to replace when they do break. $4000+ for a new transmission just doesn't computer even if it were to last as long as the competition(try half as long most of the time).50-60K seems to be as much as you typically get out of a Mercedes automatic, while the manuals last for hundreds of thousands of miles.The number of speeds and complexity isn't a bragging right if it breaks all the time. "
"fedlawman","February 2010"," Oh, I never claimed they were bragging, and I never said these transmission were durable. I was merely pointing out that a lot of R&D goes into designing their sophisticated auto transmissions - specifically for the NA market. These are not taxi cab hand me downs.Of course, if you insist on buying any modern car, European or otherwise, with an a complex automatic, then the old adage, ""buyer beware"" comes to mind.The threads here (German, Japanese, and Domestic) are filled with people flailing their arms and seeking class action lawsuits because their transmissions failed at 80, 90, or 100K miles. Most of them , I'll venture to say, either bought the car second hand and have no idea of the maintenance history (or lack thereof), or bought their car new, and never thought to flush the tranny).I say, these days if you really want your transmission to last, row your own gears. "
"kdshapiro","February 2010"," Nobody buys a new transmission at 100K miles, should there be a failure. It's a real shame, it happens and is not limited to manfacturers due east of the United States.Honda, Infiniti, Acura, BMW, Mercedes all new transmission are between $3500 and $4500. People will buy a remanufactured transmission for thousands less. It's a rare bird that will swing for a new tranny at 100K. I also don't believe it's a normal occurence to have a Mercedes tranny fail at 100K. I'm not saying it never happens, heck I'm saying I'm sure it happens to all manufacturers, but not as a matter of course. "
"plekto","February 2010"," No, $2500 plus labor, tax, and so on is usually what the *rebuilt* ones go for. It's just insane.I found this in a typical search:C, E, and S Class Vehicle $2195.001996 and Up $300 CoreOnly a 12K/12 month warranty at that price as well. And that's if you buy direct. Your mechanic still has to install it, plus you pay tax and shipping and so on on the thing, plus tax on the install.$3500-$4K total for a *Rebuilt* one. Just insane. "
"kdshapiro","February 2010"," It is crazy. I just did a quick search. A remanufactured tranny for a 2004 G35 is $2250. I'm sure a new one is north of $4000. The reality is the typical G35 nor the typical Mercedes is not going to need a transmission for the life of the car. There are always the exceptions on both side.Here are the warranty terms on the Infiniti transmission:Our transmission comes with a 1-YEAR UNLIMITED WARRANTY. You may purchase our 2-YEAR WARRANTY for additional $1013.00. You may purchase our 3-YEAR WARRANTY for additional $2154.00.Core deposit: $800Not any different. "
"qbrozen","February 2010"," My Volvo is right around the $4k-$4500 mark, and that is for a rebuilt trans (no such thing as a new '01 auto trans). And many folks tell me I am guaranteed to need a replacement during my ownership.There is one other choice, though. A full manual trans conversion. Even that will run close to $3k, though, and that's with me doing all the labor myself. "
"kdshapiro","February 2010"," If the car is an '01 you ought to be able to rack up 250k to 300k miles. In that time you might need a new tranny, in fact a lot of cars would require a tranny swap by 300000 miles. By the time you reach the point prices should drop. "
"tayl0rd","February 2010"," Man, I'm getting confused. The same exact discussion on 2 boards right now. Here and the Luxo Performance board. Same here! This board has been dead for the longest time then all of a sudden it explodes back to life with off topic chatter about maintenance?? There is a maintenance board, ya know. Maybe there's been a mistake on the server side and the posts are showing up here by accident. :confuse: "
"plekto","February 2010"," Well luxury and performance and making the best choice means weighing a lot of factors. Currently we have a problem where the best performing cars are often the least reliable, despite the fact that logic would suggest that if you spent 40-60K on a car, it should be built better than a normal Civic.The question that keeps being brought up is how do I get a luxury sport sedan that won't give my mechanic a free trip to Hawaii every time I get it worked on? "
"kdshapiro","February 2010"," I don't understand the issue. A lot of people I know own German made brands, nobody is sending their mechanics to easy street, and everybody can talk about their favorite (insert your manufacturer here) horror story. One reason I don't take any maintenance and repair board to heart when buying a car is because people complain before they kvell. I found out long ago, trying to be the perfect statistic according to any automotive survey is a crap shoot, so I don't buy according to those either. Do I care what JD Powers has to say? Not really.Manufacturers make warranties to fix cars that have issues. I buy the car I like and let the chips fall where they may. I don't worry about things. That's what lemon laws are for, although I've never needed to use them. The manfacturer who holds the distinction for the most trips to the dealer is Nissan. So needless to say I have no burning desire to own anymore models from them or their luxury brand.One last thing, if one spends a cool .5 million on a car your logic suggests it would be bullet-proof, since Honda can make a Civic nearly bullet-proof. However, it aint so, is it? Infiniti can't even make a G35 as bullet proof as a Civic. At least a Civic as far as I know has never had a recall to fix an issue that cause cause an engine fire. "
"qbrozen","February 2010"," I sure hope you are right, shap, but it seems the '01-'02 had weak transmissions and many owners have replaced by 100k. :sick: "
"smarty666","February 2010"," first off you talk to me that I'm not paying attention to the forum posts yet now your going off about the Civic? did you see what the title of this forum is? entry-level luxury sedans!! the word, Civic, Honda, Toyota, or Nissan shouldn't even be in this forum since none of their products are luxury cars - we should get back to discussing the cars listed on the right hand side of the screen!! by the way, why is the G35 listed for comparison here, lets update it to the G37; the G37 is a vast improvement over the early model year G35s in almost every regard!! kdshapiro is right though that you should, when deciding on a luxury car not put too much stock in what people say here or JD Power or any of the other car mags say because in the end you have to do what you want and you'll always get people who had the opposite experience with a companyfor instance, kdshapiro had trouble with Nissan and Infiniti, I have had the best luck with those two companies in regards to few problems and the fit/finish and reliability which contradicts what he said; I have several family members and friends who have German cars all who have had extensive problems with some of their BMWs and MBs! so my point is, you have to take what people say here with a grain of salt and basically talk to people YOU KNOW who have cars or car manufactures your looking into possibly getting and then make your own decisions what you want to do; really, any car this day, as kdshapiro pointed out is a gamble and that is why we have lemon laws and hopefully new recall laws to enable people who have problem with their cars to either get rid of them or get them fixed!!!

It was, agaion, wonderful until the day I swapped - but I no longer trusted it. My Vauxhalls, (GM), were exceptional. My Skoda was an absolute gem and my current Volvo is a superb long-distance cruiser. My wife's Fords, Vauxhall and current Honda have all been faultless.

"rayainsw","February 2010"," As mentioned above, the 2 top contenders for my next car are currently the BMW 335iS & the Audi S4.I learned something about the Audi transmission behavior since I tested the first one available in the Atlanta area. So I decided to take another short test drive on Saturday morning. To see if what I had learned had a significant effect of the aspects of the dual clutch seven speed S Tronic trans. behavior that had concerned me in my previous test drive.And the short answer is: Yes.The fact that I did not know is the existence of a kickdown switch in the S4&#146;s throttle travel.From page 134 of the Owner&#146;s Manual:&#147;Kick-downKick-down enables maximum acceleration.When you press the accelerator pedal down beyond the resistance point, the automatic transmission downshifts into a lower gear, depending on vehicle speed and engine RPM. It shifts up into the next higher gear once the maximum specified engine RPM is reached&#148;My two objections to the transmission, when I drove one before, both had to do with the &#145;Manual-ness&#146; of the S Tronic when in &#147;Manual Mode&#148;. 1 - The automatic transmission downshifted when in Manual Mode & I floored the throttle. What I expected was: When in manual mode, remain in the gear selected, regardless of throttle position.2 &#150; My commands to upshift before redline when accelerating at WOT were [ ahem ] declined. Completely ignored.It turns out that I must have pressed right past that &#145;resistance point&#146;, and this caused the behaviors I observed.[ I did not know about this &#145;feature&#146; &#150; nor did the Sales Associate, when I questioned him about this. ]So, this kickdown \ resistance point at WOT actually addresses both my criticisms. Not pushing through this &#145;kick down&#146; switch makes a huge difference, for me.With substantial throttle [ essentially WOT, but not quite &#145;foot to the floor&#146; ] the upshift commands are answered &#150; quickly. And the shifts occur almost immediately &#150; and with authority. Very quick, but not jarring. Excellent. And almost surreal.And avoiding this switch also means no [ unwanted ] downshifts in manual mode, based only on throttle opening. We&#146;re good.I also confirmed that the trans. will upshift at red line &#150; not hang on rev limiter! The behavior I prefer.So &#150; I&#146;d still prefer that the trans. &#145;gear selected&#146; display be a bit larger, and higher in the dash display. . . But I can live with the current presentation, I suppose.And there is still one thing I do find somewhat annoying about the trans. At very low speeds, it automatically downshifts all the way to first &#150; making it difficult to drive smoothly at parking lot speeds.The rest of the car is impressive, to me: Interior comfort, materials & styling appeal to me.The handling is impressive.The handling feel, particularly considering the significant front weight bias, was quite responsive & satisfying.The ride was a bit harsh on cratered back streets, but this S4 had the 19&#148; tires & wheels &#150; where I&#146;d likely stick with the standard 18s.And the Audi Drive Select Package &#150; that includes the Sport Rear Diff.For European Delivery.Excellent.It is remotely possible that the 335iS, with 370 TQ and the performance exhaust may seduce me &#150; but, for now, the S4 is at the top of my &#145;short list&#146;.- Ray[ Note: It appears unlikely that the 335iS will be available for test at a Dealer before this June or July. Sigh. ] "
"plekto","February 2010"," I hear you about the odd transmissions. My biggest gripe is that when in manual mode, most will behave correctly until they think they should do something else and you are suddenly not in control. A great example was when I was test-driving a RX8 a while back. At least it has the general concept right in that it stays in the gear you select most of the time. So leaving it in 3rd running around town was fine, and there was enough engine compression to work fine(as long as you didn't hit the brakes).But when slowing down, it would do odd things. Say, I was going 35 and decided to slow down to 20. It would always drop into top gear and then wait. Then when it thought I was at the right speed, select a gear for me. Now, I know this is supposedly to keep the car from stalling with idiot drivers, but the second that you tapped the brakes, the engine reverted to automatic. So a simple maneuver of slowing from 35 to 20 in 2nd gear and then powering out of the corner wasn't possible if you used your brakes even the slightest bit. What happened was 35(tap brakes to slow down a little bit... shifts to overdrive(!), then when you hit the gas again in the middle of the turn, it selected 3rd(reverted to automatic mode - have to satisfy the EPA MPG tests). Then you had to manually downshift it to 2nd/override its behavior to power out of the turn.It felt a lot like when you're at the top of a hill on a roller coaster and the thing disconnects from the chain. tick tick tick tick (full second of nothing happening as you are freed from the mechanism) Going from 2nd to 5th in a turn feels like you just dropped into neutral as the engine compression evaporates completely. On the RX8, it was very disconcerting since the thing has no torque at all unless it's revved up to 3-4K+ It should have just stayed in 2nd the whole time. Instead I got this feeling of the drive shaft being disconnected every time I hit the brakes to slow down a tiny bit. Which given the mile high gearing on most cars these days is impossible no to do - leaving it in gear to slow down takes ages.Now some do better than others, but the thing is, just get a manual if they offer it. No idiocy, cheaper to repair and buy, and it behaves like it should at all times.BTW, check out the G37. It impressed me. "

"markcincinnati","February 2010"," The Audi offers, 3 1/2 different modes with the Tiptronic and ADS (D, S and M#1 and M#2, providing the ""1/2"" mode):D = Drive mode (but you get Drive Comfort or Drive Auto)S = Sport mode (still fully automatic shifting, but you get Drive Dynamic until you exit Sport mode) M = Manual mode #1 - where ""it"" decides how long you stay in M mode; ""it"" decides when to take you back to D mode or S mode if you have used the paddle shifters and were either in Drive or Sport when you used the paddle.M = Manual mode #2 - where it stays where you keep it, unless you slow below ""lugging"" then it will downshif from M6, to MN, where ""N"" is a lower gear based on road speed. In Manual mode #2, I do not actually know if you were in M4, for instance and pressed the pedal to the metal if it would down shift or not. I thought I had read somewhere that kickdown was either disabled or that you had to push through the resistance (Resistance is Futile -- the Borg!)So, in D, Auto mode, apparently you get, sometimes, D = Comfort mode and sometimes D = Dynamic (or sport) mode.The Tip I have is the best ever -- it does, however, make me long for the DSG 7 speed and maybe even the new 8 speed Tiprtonic.

My new commute, 3.25 miles each way. To avoid piling miles on my wife's RX350 (yes the Subie was hers, don't ask) I need something I can enjoy driving on backroads, and which my family of 3 can enjoy on long highway drives as much as the RX, with better mileage hopefully. Since I'll put few miles on it, anything with less than 70k on it used is on the table. I'm in New England, with a steep driveway,so RWD is a dicey proposition.

"plekto","May 2010"," (mulls over the data)The best car for you would be a white 2009 Pontiac G8.(the other colors are ""meh"" and most women want that pearlescent white) Good reliability, low price, handles very well. Overall a great deal for the money that unfortunately GM in its idiocy decided to stop selling. I drove one and it was about 80% as nice as the previous generation CTS, which is what I'd probably have otherwise recommend. But the fact that you want midsize over luxury and are considering the Mazda 6, plus the G35 means a few years old or certified is also in the consideration... (I get a $25K new/used price range, right?)It really was an eye-opener. GM as usual, has their second best car aside from the new CTS NOT for sale in the U.S. It's still sold in Australia, and is the #1 car there. Be sure to get the premium audio but NOT the nav, since that radio/information center is incredible and NAV systems are a waste of money.(just get a portable model for $300) One look at the radio and you'll see that it's the best radio/information center GM has ever built. Note - the 2007 CTS is also an absolute steal. As the last year of the previous style, it has few reliability issues, looks and handles great, and well, it's under $20K for a certified example. There's probably no better used deal right now that I can think of, especially since in three months, off-lease models will start to appear.(4 years old is the sweet spot for certified/off-lease executive type cars)No reason to buy now, though. Wait until the 2011 models come out and the used prices go down by several thousand dollars. http://www.autotrader.com/fyc/vdp.jsp?ct=p&car_id=278774963This is the V8 model - crazy fun.

"slance66","May 2010"," Well every car on my list is a ""luxury"" brand and this is the entry level luxury form. I mentioned the Mazda only because it seems all around capable. The only GM I've ever owned is a 1970 Cutlass convertible. I have planned on continuing that streak. I find the CTS mostly unattractive, and it was unfortunate that Acura has been copying all the harsh angles. The new LaCrosse is good looking, but I'm just not that old. There is no way a G8 will ever get up my driveway in winter, and the styling? Maybe when I was 15. I'd get a CTS first for sure.I feel like the default pick is a 3-series, but the run-flat tires don't appeal and the out of warranty service could be a problem. Maybe I should chance the Audi reliability with an A6. It does everything else well. "
"plekto","May 2010"," The previous generation CTS is a lot less ugly than the new one and would be my pick, then. The pearl white and light blue are very nice and are aimed at female buyers. YOU might not like the CTS, but your wife probably will love it after a test drive after her old car she's been suffering with.I know this as my mother is looking for the exact same type of car - and the CTS keeps staying on her top 3 list.That's a nice car - lighter colors hide the angles a lot.Look, the simple fact is that anything from BMW, Audi, or Mercedes will literally cost you thousands a year in repairs and maintainance once it's out of warranty. I'm talking about idiocy like $6000-$12000 transmissions and $500 for a sensor under the hood. You have been warned if you go down that path.

New one is hideous.Acua TSX: Too small...glorfied Civic. ****Your original list immediately shrinks to this. Lexus is largely bland, souless junk. (two exceptions though - I'll get to them in a bit). Infiniti is great. The G37 Journey is fantastic. And, honestly, NONE of the AWD system in cars unless they are 100% full-time engaged actually work in bad weather. It's pure marketing and smoke and mirrors. So either get a 4x4 vehicle or something like a Subaru that has full-time 4 wheel drive. Or just get a 2wd vehicle and save money. note - this also gets you 2-5mpg back.Interesting that you say that the new 2009 TSX is small - it's much larger than the older one and I thought it would be a perfect fit.Anyways - the reason you consider domestic vehicles is because they depreciate quickly and yet are solidly engineered. I can guarantee that 95%+ of the people on this forum can't begin to reach the limits of a first generation CTS, let alone something like a G37. So, the two Lexus exceptions you should look at:The IS300 was perhaps the closest thing Japan ever made to a 3 series in terms of getting that small European sport sedan feel. They also are one of the least expensive luxury sport sedans ever made in terms of repairs and upkeep. I'd look at one - and actually drive it before you pass on it, because it is a great car to drive. I'd also say the same thing about a 2007 CTS - DRIVE it and then decide if it's bad or not. The other one is a 2005 Lexus GS300. What makes this car special is that it is RWD and has a 3.0L inline 6 engine. As a result, it has great reliability, smoothness, power, and does it while getting good MPG. There's a reason BMW and uses inline 6 engines, and Lexus got it exactly right with both the IS300 and the GS300(same engine, btw, in both).Why did they change? They worshiped HP and marketing more than building a perfect compromise. Then again, to be honest, both designs are dated compared to the CTS, which was a real game changer. Other than that, you're looking at a Volvo or maybe a SUV. The reality is fo rused cars:Japan - reliable, expensive to fix, costly to buy used.(depreciate too slowly)GM - less reliable, inexpensive to fix, reasonably priced.(depreciate normally)BMW/Mercedes/Audi - terrible reliability, insane to fix, reasonably priced.(depreciate like a rock) "
"tlong","May 2010"," Disagree that BMW/Mercedes/Audi depreciate like a rock. They actually have really good residuals, as does VW. The driving experience and interiors of these cars raise their values even though the maintenance is high and reliability is highly variable. I've owned VW and Audi and I love the vehicles. I've had pretty good luck with reliability, but you are correct - if you have to pay for the repair it is not going to be pretty. When I owned an Audi (not THAT bad for repairs and reliability) I wished for a very reliable Japanese car.Then I got rid of it and bought an Acura TL. I now have a very reliable Japanese (brand) car. And I really long for the Audi!Pick your poison; I am still searching for the European driving experience together with the Japanese reliability. Let me know when you find it.  "
"plekto","May 2010"," I am still searching for the European driving experience together with the Japanese reliability. Let me know when you find it. One car fits that bill, a used IS300. I know, I drove everything, and the only *Japanese* car in your price range that feels like a European model is that one.Now, domestics have that as well, though reliability is a little less. It's still worlds better than BMW or Audi, though. GM has spent a lot of time testing their cars in Germany lately, and the G8, CTS, and a few others show it. They feel properly ""European"" as well. "
"slance66","May 2010"," Yes this is exactly my problem! My prior car was a Volvo S60, which was a compromise that fell just short on both counts. Still it was an excellent car for 9 years. Now I'm in a bullet-proof Subaru Tribeca. Build quality is amazing, but I want a sedan again and better than the 23 highway MPG I get with the Tribeca. As for the CTS mentioned previously, my wife hates them. She has a Lexus RX350, so she's very happy with that. She wants me to get a soul-less Lexus ES350, which she loves. I'm looking for a little more of the European driving experience than that, even a TL would be better. I'm looking at used because I pay cash for cars, never had a payment and I don't want one and because new cars are a rip-off, especially for someone with a 3 mile commute. "
"plekto","May 2010"," Ah. Bit clearer now. The G37 sedan is your likely best bet, then. It's big, luxurious(just get the Journey package with the wood trim and NO sport package), and handles far better than your Volvo did. It also costs the least per repair of any of the luxury models, so that's a plus. It's a much more refined car than the G35, which felt like a 4 door Z. IMO, it's critical to get the wood and interior premium packages with the Infiniti and TL/TSX and NOT to get the upgraded suspension or tires. The stock suspension is exactly firm enough and gives the car a slightly sedate feel on highway roads as opposed to jarring you to death for that extra 5% grip.There is one more option as well, but that's only if you like manual transmissions. The Mercedes C class is actually a perfectly decent vehicle if you don't get a sunroof, nav, or anything that is electronic or a gadget that can break AND get manual as well. Of course, less than 5% came as base models like this(leather, wood trim, etc, but no electronics), so it can be hard to find the exact right one. Avoid automatics - the repair bill on one is reason enough to never get anything from Mercedes with an automatic.The gem of course was a 2003-2005 C230K *sedan*. The replacement for it is a tremendous seller in Europe(now C300K, iirc). It gets a legitimate 35 mpg highway and is the ""real deal"". But only if you get manual. (the manual is easily as refined as the 3 series - almost video game easy) "
"roadburner","May 2010"," A BMW won't be as inexpensive to run as a Honda, but they are nowhere near as expensive to maintain as the urban legends some like to parrot. Since 1983 I've always had one or more BMWs in the garage; I currently own a 1995 3 Series as well as a 2004 X3(and a 1975 2002- but that's a hobby car). The 3er has 121K miles on it and the X3 has 92K miles on the clock. Maintenance and repair costs for both are averaging @5 cents per mile(in the case of the X3, that number is calculated over the 42K miles after the free maintenance plan expired). Non-scheduled repairs on the 3er have consisted of a brake light switch, a thermostat, and the serpentine belt idler pullies. The X3 has required a passenger seat SRS sensor(replaced under warranty). Of the cars you mentioned, I'd take an E39 530i- with the Sport Package, of course. It's a fantastic car; many enthusiasts(myself included) think that it is superior to its E60 successor.As for non BMWs, I'd also take a look at the Mazdaspeed 6. I find the Lexus models to be terribly unsafe;if I drove one I'd almost certainly die of boredom...  "
"slance66","May 2010"," Yeah G37 looks nice, but is beyond my ""no car payments"" price point, since it's a new model. I drove a G35x, and liked it except that what I'd like even more is a detuned model with 230-240HP and better mileage. The 4 door Z description is right on. Where is the balance? I agree on the wood in the Inifiniti and Acura, the metal looks too ""techno"" and cold, and agree on the suspension and tires. Anything less than an aspect ratio of 55 is way too hard to handle our broken New England pavement without punishing your kidneys.I don't need Nav...I would opt for it in a Japanese car, as I expect it to be trouble free. I can't get a manual, as my wife can't drive them. So Auto it is, but I like the idea of de-electifying a MB. I really like the 2008+ C class, looks better and the prior version was awfully small in the back. Prices are still high though. Haven't checked the 03-05, but will look at specs. I had the same thought with BMW...a 525xi with no i-drive. I'd rather a nice cupholder than that knob. At least MBs have cupholders. "
"slance66","May 2010"," roadburner, if I had an indi BMW mechanic nearby, I'd probably put an E39 530i near the top of my list. I've seen several of them for sale, at good prices. Snow tires and wheels would be a definite expense however, for any RWD car. Even then I'd worry about my steep driveway, but a 5 series should have good weight distribution. Are there any known big expenses with those (I assume timing belt...what mileage?).  "
"plekto","May 2010"," The base G37 starts at almost exactly $30K new(cars direct has one for $30,200 after $1K in incentives!) So used run 4-8K less. The Journey with premium and maple wood accents(2010 only  ) is $34,115(advertised street price). So 25K for a 1-2 year old example is possible to find. Yes, it surprised me as well - it seems like a steal at that price.http://www.autotrader.com/fyc/vdp.jsp?ct=u&car_id=278031393This is a nice color combo - though it's not the Journey with wood trim and all of that. edit - these two are different shades of blue...http://www.autotrader.com/fyc/vdp.jsp?ct=p&car_id=272067925Typical private party price. It's a stunning color in person and looks like a very expensive car. Doubly so since it's the new model. I know how women want to be seen in the new model if possible  Maybe it's not required, but it's certainly a feather in their cap if it's new bling vs old bling. My brain also did a double-take at these prices. If you can wait until September when the 2011 models come out, a 2010 with that nice wood trim will be available in the 25K range.edit - they have 0% and 2.9% financing now, so this fall, expect great incentives on a 2010. I can't find one, but the light interior and wood trim makes it feel much more luxury inside. "
"roadburner","May 2010"," No US spec BMW engine has used a timing belt since late 1991. The cooling system is the only major issue. Most owners practice preventative maintenance and replace the water pump, thermostat, and radiator at @100K miles. My indie shop charged me @$1000 to do the work on my wife's 528i back in 2005(it's an easy afternoon DIY job but it was the middle of winter and my wife needed the car pronto). I bought a set of winter tires/wheels and changed them out myself in November and March; the car had no trouble in any sort of winter weather. There's a great E39 group non Yahoo as well as several websites dedicated to the E39. It is just a fantastic car. As a matter of fact, I'm considering picking up a low-mileage E39 M5 for a daily driver/track toy. "
"slance66","May 2010"," Some nice possibilities, especially at that price. Hopefully the new auto tames it a bit, but it shocks me that they don't make a version with better mileage at 250HP. They would sell loads of them (just like teh 328 outsells the 335 by a lot). The interior is much more M like. MPG is terrible, so I'd honestly probably just get an M35x instead, since it is plenty fast enough for me, and there are lots of used ones. Need to drive a 2003 530i too..and probably a few others. "
"plekto","May 2010"," Well, funny you should mention that... :P The G25 is coming out this fall. Same car, smaller ~220hp engine. The base model should be in the $27-28K range(msrp at $29-30K would be my guess, invoice closer to $27K). Finding a program/dealer car a few months old for $25K should be possible. That is, if you can wait 5-6 months.And, yes, the automatic tames it quite a bit. It drives more like a 5 series or E class than a Z. (that said, yes, it will make scenery go by very, very fast.)There are pictures online but Nissan is keeping very mum about the car. My guess is that they want the competition to get theirs out first and under-cut them. I'd suspect that they are worried about the IS250 and the new Regal, though the Regal is out now, so we might expect a major announcement sometime soon.EDIT:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_SkylineIt's sold as the Skyline 250GT(same exact car as the G25, essentially) and is currently on sale in Japan. The combined fuel economy for the car (testing comes from Singapore, of all places) lists it as roughly 24-25mpg combined, with a highway figure of close to 35mpg. One site in Japan lists it as getting 38mpg in a test, but that was on a track under controlled conditions. And it should weigh about 3250lbs - about 300lbs lighter than the G37. This will make it a great car among people who like mountain roads, since the only complaint with the G37/Z370 is its weight is a bit more than you'd like for serious mountain roads.G37 5.6 seconds.G25 7.0 seconds. (that's about a second faster than the IS250 and Regal)It's not stupidly fast, but it certainly isn't a slouch, either. Getting that type of performance out of a tiny engine like that is amazing, really. If they pull it off, it'll be the equivalent of a hat-trick. Low cost, sport/luxury, and economy car mpg. All while NOT being slow. "
"slance66","May 2010"," Interesting...looks like they dropped a beefed up version of the 2.5L four from the Altima in? Or is this a smaller displacement V6?. I really like the small 6 in the IS250 and the efficient 6 in the 328. I can't see paying premium prices for anything with a 4, although I've considered it with the Audi/VW 2.0T. I wonder where the weight drop comes from? 7 sec 0-60 is not bad at all. Fortunately, I do have time...no hurry really.***Just read a few reports. No turbo, 2.5L V6, specs around the 220 mentioned. Of course some writers asked ""why move downmarket"". Do these writers live in the real world? Not long ago, 220 was pretty powerful...300 was reserved for rarified company. This is a brilliant move. "
"plekto","May 2010"," Yeah, 220HP is plenty, as it comes close to the 15lbs/HP make-or-break sweet spot. (14.7 actually) For reference, that is 3000lbs and 200HP plus at least 200lb-ft of torque.(basically a 6 cylinder engine, preferably as small and quick to rev as possible)The IS300 was very close to this magic ratio. BMW has tried to maintain this as well, though the recent 3 series' are too fat and suffers greatly in handling compared to the E36, which is still the best choice - it's the last ""classic"" BMW worth getting. But, at 10 year old, now, it's a dicey proposition due to maintainance.That's why the 1 series is so popular - lighter and quicker on its feet for a fairly reasonable price. It eeks just under the 3000lb limit/ proper ratio. Very fun to drive as a result.The problem with the Regal and IS250 is that they are in the 3500-3600lb range and lose their edge. Not *quite* fast enough, not *quite* agile enough. Sure, the bigger versions (IS350 and Regal GS when it comes out) are stomping, wild beasts, but they lose that small sport sedan feel,. And they cost a lot more money. "
"qbrozen","May 2010"," I'd be surprised if they could cut 300 lbs compared to the G37. I mean, we're talking same platform. Changing just the engine wouldn't save that much. Unless they are going to use lightened body panels, which would add cost, I don't see it happening. "
"markcincinnati","May 2010"," . . .why not look at a new Genesis (with the 6) sedan. A friend of mine bought one and he says the deals on them are ""impressive."" He had come from a 5 series Bimmer, the last in a string of many, too. . . . Far as I can tell, although he is hardly rich beyond the dreams of avarice, he bought because of the deal compared to the deal plus the content differences on yet another RWD 5 series, not because he no longer could afford a 5 series.I thought, at the time, he was crazy -- now, not so much. And, before you think I am crazy, my current Audi (#29 in my life -- including the ones that have been mine or my wife's) is an '09 A4 Prestige with the 19"" sport package and ADS on it -- I live in Cincinnati (that is we have about a 70 30 ratio of road to potholes); all that lovely sportiness I paid for is virtually useless. I play dodgem' with my car -- and including the factory originals have now had 12 tires (4 OE plus 8 replacements) due to tire damage. I love the sport quotient of these great German cars (and probably the Japanese and American cars of the same ilk) -- but frankly, until the US, Ohio, Hamilton County, Cincinnati infrastructure reaches a road to pothole ratio of 95 5, my cars sport/lux quotient is great to look at but virtually impossible to enjoy (much.) If I could get an AWD Genesis, I'd probably seriously consider it -- or a tank with rubber treads.Perhaps a new or demo or leftover Genesis (or lightly used one) is out there somewhere at an even better price. The warranty is impressive and the car certainly seems to push many of your buttons. :shades: "
"kevinc5","May 2010"," I'm getting bored with looking at all the usual suspects in the family car line...Altima, Camry, Accord, etc. C300 too small. IS 250 same. Thought I'd move up a bit and test drove a 2007 G35. 38,000 miles, dealer asking $25,800. Nice ride. Miles a little high, price a little high. But do I need 300+ HP for my 2d car??? Might get 18 MPG on premium fuel in the city?? I'll probably pass...though I'd be a Happy Boy in a G25. What to do? What to do? "
"slance66","May 2010"," You're not crazy. I was just looking at the Genesis. Power is there with the 3.8, mileage is better than most, and honestly, is a damned handsome car when you see it on the street or in a parking lot. My biggest concern personnally is the size...I look at an A6 and think, damn, that's a bit bigger than ""mid-size"". Then comparing the the Genesis to the A6, it is longer, but not as wide. It is longer and wder than a 5 series, M35 or MB E350. I just don't know if I want to drive anything that big (length in particular). Lack of AWD is a drawback. "
"qbrozen","May 2010"," Lack of AWD is a drawback.Only if you are offroading or deal with 6 months of snow, IMHO.I made it through 3 blizzards this year with a '92 Benz with snow tires. No traction control. No stability control. Just the snow tires and an antiquated ABS. Not one iota of drama driving in horrible conditions (had to take 9-month pregnant wife to the hospital in the middle of the night after 2 feet had fallen and no signs of letting up). I'm a convert. I am no longer concerned about having a RWD daily driver. (although that is all I grew up with, so go figure why I, and so many other people, have forgotten we survived it then, so we'll survive it now.) "
"slance66","May 2010"," On AWD, I look at it this way: I have a 20 plus degree grade in my driveway, so hill climbing is critical. RWD will suffer compared to AWD at hill climbing, even with snow tires (it will better AWD in stopping and turning with snows vs all weather). Then there is the cost of buying wheels and tires, and paying for the changeover and storage (I have no room for 4 sets of wheels/tires). The cost probably evens out, but AWD is just more convenient, and you don't have the occasional early or late snow, or the unusually warm winter days that chew up your snow tires. So I could give it a try...hell I grew up driving a 77 Cougar in the snow...no ABS, no traction control, and horrifically bad front/rear weight balance. Of course it couldn't climb our snow covered driveway then either. "
"plekto","May 2010"," If you have a 20 degree driveway, you need 4 wheel drive. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7dVFY5CxT0&feature=relatedThe problem is that the systems try to out-think the situation and react too slowly. So they get stuck and actually in some cases literally stop turning ANY of the wheels despite the throttle being on full. 6:15 is the part to watch - a dirt hill climb.What appears to happen with most of them is that the system transfers enough power to the rear wheels to merely keep the vehicle's place stable on the hill and does the climbing with the fronts alone. This works to a point. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xJusLJQbv8Ouch.Trust me - almost all of the drive systems that transfer power back and forth fail like this and are only good for getting unstuck from a flat snowy driveway or the side of a road. Note - Subaru and a few others are full-time AWD and do work. Part-time is rubbish, so don't bother wasting your money.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXOPcwMnC6c&feature=related4wd. Just pay the extra money if you really need snow performance.Snow tires are much more critical, though:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P03wqClnq-0&feature=relatedA nice video I found showing how AWD isn't going to save you while snow tires likely will. There are 6 in the series - it's very informative, if a bit repetitive.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXuhfwY74b8A bit more funny  "
"slance66","May 2010"," Here's my experience so far:2000 Volvo v70 XC: usually climbed the driveway with few problems2001 FWD S60: had major problems, even with just light snow. However, I when put Nokian WR all season/snow tires on, and it climbed as well as the XC did.07 Lexus RX350: Climbs pretty well, similar to the Volvo.07 Subaru Tribeca: Climbs ok, but slides more than the Lexus or Volvo XC, and is much worse going down. Why? 255-55-18 tires act like snow saucers. Stupid choice by Subaru. So I'm reluctant to move away from AWD, and the modern electronic systems do work better, in my experience, than the YouTube videos show, especially when good AS tires are used. In fact, the superior Subaru system proves less important than the tires in most respects. "
"qbrozen","May 2010"," the superior Subaru system proves less important than the tires in most respectsThat's really the key point. If someone NEEDS awd/4wd, then they also need to be concerned about what tires are on there. It is the most important part of the car. "
"kdshapiro","June 2010"," I made it through 3 blizzards this yearI think ""made"" is the operative word. I used to live near Buffalo and owned a car without ABS or AWD. I ""made"" it through horrible winters. My RWD did have snows.My Subie with good all-seasons, ABS and AWD, is a much better driver than my old RWD.I also ""made"" it through several winters in my BMW with just all-seasons.A number of houses in my development have 20 degree inclines. I have pictures during the winter where cars were parked at the bottom of the driveway. For those houses the trucks and AWD models were the ones that made it up the driveway.Until I move to San Diego (or Phoenix), AWD will stay on every vehicle in the family. "
"kdshapiro","June 2010"," We had a nasty, nasty winter. My Subie with all seasons did just fine. The only reason I couldn't drive it out of the garage is the the snow on the ground was above the front grill, I wasn't even going to attempt it.In my opinion, unless you are in a climate where the majority of winter you deal with huge snowfalls and unplowed roads almost any AWD system will be fine. If I had to deal with huge snowfalls and unplowed roads on a regular basis, I would get a big truck with AWD and outfit it with snow tires. "
"slance66","June 2010"," Well the search continues. I drove a 2008 Lexus IS250 AWD. Not fast, but not a dog either. Cockpit was nice, if slightly tight. I was very happy with the balance between handling and ride on out broken pavement. It's just quite small in back, and never inexpensive. Wondering if I can suffer FWD again with an ES, which would be bigger and faster...without the handling.Next stop, a 2007 328xi. Interior had many loose pieces and was a grade, no two grades below the Lexus. Hell the interior in my Tribeca was a grade better. Ergonomics however, were perfect...armrest exactly where it is needed (Subie's is 6 inches too low). Seat was fine. More room in back than the IS. Now the drive...there wasn't one. Battery was dead and couldn't be jumped. Yes, BMW is off to a glorious start. Don't even ask about cupholders. This same place has a 525xi and a MB E350 4matic. I'll give those a go instead. "
"kdshapiro","June 2010"," I had a BMW, and over the years I've driven almost every model extensively except the M variations and Alpina. They drive like they are on rails. (As an aside I didn't have any issues with my BMW)I was just in an 2010 ES and I have to say the interior is nicer than a CAMRY but was just so so to my tastes, a little classy not really luxurious, but defintely upscale. Yes, it has all of the bells and whistles and drove very nice, buy you pay for the Lexus(BMW) experience. As an aside I'm a fan of BMW interiors, they have exactly what it takes to drive the car and nothing else, I even like idrive.A friend has the IS250 and I've ridden in the car many times and I agree with your assessment.I'm not one to get a pre-owned/used vehicle. I know there are people on this board who go to sites to get in my opinion unrealistic pricing on certain vehicles. I know of nobody who has ever gotten a car from one of these sites, so it's not something I would ever try. "
"qbrozen","June 2010"," Until I move to San Diego (or Phoenix), AWD will stay on every vehicle in the family. The weight and fuel penalty for EVERY car year round for just a few days when its needed? Well, to each his own.Next winter, I'll be trying out FWD with snows (my luxury performance V70... to stay on topic  ). We'll see how that goes. Considering my S70 with good all seasons was one of the best winter cars I ever had, I have no doubt I'll be just fine.And, yes, I'll be hoping to ""make"" it through. Not sure what else I could ask for. Winning a winter rallycross? Summitting the highest peak in NJ in record time? Nah. Making it through is all I want.

"mz6greyghost","June 2010"," The weight and fuel penalty for EVERY car year round for just a few days when its needed? Well, to each his own. Quoted for agreement.As someone that's lived in Upstate NY (Syracuse), I've dealt with all kinds of weather, including snow that falls from 4-6 inches PER HOUR. I've also driven all kinds of vehicles, from subcompact cars to pick-ups and full-size vans. No matter which wheels are driven, winter tires are BY FAR the best choice. I've had better control in 4 inches of snow with a 2WD pick-up with winter tires than an AWD compact with all-seasons. Don't forget the weight penalty (and worse fuel economy) that AWD adds compared to a similar FWD/RWD vehicle, the better chances of driveline/mechanical issues/failure, and the tighter tolerances in terms of tires (which adds to more out-of-pocket $$$$$).AWD is by no means a necessity in the snow belt, as long as you know how to drive in the snow, and use a set of proper winter tires that also help to STOP and STEER, not just accelerate.And, yes, I'll be hoping to ""make"" it through. Not sure what else I could ask for. Winning a winter rallycross? Summitting the highest peak in NJ in record time?Yeah, those ""rally"" drivers are usually the SUVs and/or Subaru drivers that fly by me in a snowstorm, only for me to pass them when they're buried in a ditch and need a wrecker to pull them out.OT: Did anyone notice how the 2008 G35 is still shown on the right when it's now two (almost three) years old and superseded?

They see a tiny bit of dirt and some gravel roads every so often. And for their soft-roader SUVs, life is good.But for snow, you absolutely need mud terrain tires as a minimum. And 4x4 engaged. Also, look for a tread pattern that has lots of sipes in it. The older BFG mud terrains were very bad in rain for this reason(zero sipes anywhere), though good otherwise. "

"jtla","July 2010"," Thanks for the link to 2011 Volvo S60 T6 AWD. I read it the first time you posted. The new S60 looks promising. I think its T6 engine power output -- 300 horsepower and 325 pound-feet of torque -- is among the top of this group, especially the torque. IMO, Volvo did a fine job in both exterior styling and interior layout. As to handling, we will have to wait until the car hits the showroom and do a proper test drive.While this car may be a legitimate contender, the biggest problem for Volvo may be the lack of convincing reason for potential buyers to choose it over the competition. For performance, the 3-series and G37 still lead the pack. For luxurious feels, TL and A4 may have the edge. For dependability reputation, the Japanese brands are always safer bets. For badge shoppers, MB certainly sounds more prestigious. Safety is Volvo's strong suite, but others are not far behind. A Volvo is just so easy to lost in this crowded segment. And its new Chinese ownership doesn't help, either. "

"jtla","July 2010"," Sorry, but as much as I like the Maxima, it does not belong to this discussion. First and foremost, Nissan is not considered a luxury brand. Secondly, Maxima comes in FWD drivetrain with CVT transmission -- not a performance/sport sedan in my book. "
"kfdmed","July 2010"," TL has a five speed. The Maxima with the CVT will perform as well if not better than most the cars listed on the right. True it is not a ""luxury"" brand so I guess it doesnt belong. "
"shipo","July 2010"," While the Nissan CVT is about as good as it gets from a CVT type of transmission, ""Performance"" and ""CVT"" are mutually exclusive terms for many folks, myself included. "
"jtla","July 2010"," The Lexus IS is RWD. You are correct on TL and TSX being FWD, but TL does offer SH-AWD (not on TSX) to enhance handling. "

"fedlawman","July 2010"," Well, none of these cars are ""sports cars."" The question is how much sport do you want. I don't think FWD is a huge disadvantage in this category - 99% of people shopping this segment won't be able to tell the difference.The FWD TL may be less sporty than a RWD G37, but it is definitely sportier than a Maxima.I personally agree that the CVT completely eliminates any hope for the Maxima being included in this category. It's seems more like a sportier Toyota Avalon to me... "
"smarty666","July 2010"," Excellent topic to say the least, considering I have a 3G FWD TL, a FWD Maxima, the new one, and a RWD Infiniti I think I can add some decent insight on this. I can tell you this, the CVT does take a little away from making the Maxima a true sports sedan, like a G37 or 3-Series, but that is only b/c of the noise during acceleration and lack of shift shock. The Maxima is just as sporty as the 4G FWD TL, but FWD in itself does have limitations that RWD obviously and my 3G TL has a more sporty flair to it then the 7G Maxima. The new Maxima has virtually no torque steer during brisk acceleration and I've been able to keep up with higher powered V6's with both A/T and MT so the power and performance of the Maxima is not hindered by the CVT in the least. Saying the Maxima is a sportier version of an Avalon is a little bit ridiculous to me. Drive both cars back to back and they are totally different. The Maxima's handling is much more crisp and precise then just about anything else in the FWD market, except for say Mazda maybe. I would go as far as to say, that the Maxima is about as sporty as you can go in performance, driving dynamics, handling, etc for a FWD sedan without having to spend more money and go into a RWD luxury division vehicle. It is a four door sports sedan, no, the CVT and FWD layout prevent it becoming that, but its a sporty four door sedan. Except for one or two things, the CVT is not as bad as people make it out to be. It takes a few months, but you get used to and then when you get back into a vehicle with a regular A/T and feel shift shock, you think something is wrong In regards to fitting into this thread category its tuff to say. The Maxima is an oddity and hard to classify. Its not from a luxury division and some people have difficulty using the word luxury and Nissan in the same sentence and I can understand that. On the other hand, the power/performance, price, luxury sedan features, etc that you can get in this car would suggest and warrant at least a entry-level luxury classification. Everyone will tell you something different b/c there are no books stating what car classes there are and what goes into what. I've heard people classify the Maxima has followed over the years, ""entry-level luxury sedan,"" ""premium full-size sedan,"" ""near luxury sedan."" Pick anyone you want and use it or whatever floats your boat. It really, in the grand scheme of things doesn't mean jack squat! "
"kfdmed","July 2010"," Have any driven the Maxima CVT for any period of time? Driven it in the sport mode? The CVT in sport mode does more than just give you shift shock ... the engine revs more like a traditional auto transmission. I once thought whats the point of artificial shifting in a CVT? After using it for a while I understand why they included with the CVT. I drove the base FWD TL and Maxima back to back and dont think the TL is any more ""sporty"" than the Maxima. "
"smarty666","July 2010"," The 4G FWD TL is less sporty in my opinion then the 7G FWD Maxima, not by much but enough I noticed a difference. The Maxima had a slightly firmer/sportier ride and feedback, slightly better handling, and the look of the actual vehicle was sportier. Your right the CVT in sport mode does help to give the shift shock imitation, which is important in the feedback department, louder exhaust note upon acceleration when gunning it compared to regular drive, and the engine revs as you mentioned, all of which provides the sportier needs anyone would want from a regular A/T. Now, once you move up to the AWD 6 M/T version of the 4G TL, that the TL becomes sportier than the new Maxima, but the base version is definitely tamer then the new Maxima.Remember, a lot of people have valid critisms and hatred of the CVT b/c of what happened with the 1G version of it from 2003-2008. Since 2009, all the Nissan products have the updated 2G CVT which is much more efficient, less troubles, and far fewer problems then the 1G had. Nissan extended the transmission warranty so the CVT for them is here to stay! So far I overall really like the CVT and the fuel econ for 290HP is absolutely fabulous. "

"marcus216","July 2010"," I currenlty own a 2010 TL SH-AWD. I looked at the RL also. To be honest, I can't understand why anyone would buy or lease the current RL versus the TL. The TL is slightly larger, has the same engine, gets better gas mileage and is thousands less. Yes, the RL in its current form is quite dated but has some nice attributes. My suggestions for the next generation RL is to make it a few inches wider, about 6 inches longer (adding back seat room and trunk space). Instead of rear wheel drive, they can keep the current AWD platform and use a turbo charged V6 engine that produces 300+ ft/lbs of torque and around 330+ HP. Acura utilizes turbo charging technology in the RDX , so it is not new technology for them. BMW, Audi, and even Ford are using turbo charging with great success. "
"kevinc5","July 2010"," Finally, someone gets it right. Thanks. (A long time Bimmer fan.) "
"smarty666","July 2010"," Exactly, Acura screwed themselves on the RL just like Nissan, until the newest generation of course, did with the Maxima and Altima. They made the Altima more powerful, nicer materials, etc over their flagship Maxima, which then in turn hurt the Maxima b/c the Altima was cheaper and you were getting more for your money. Thankfully Nissan rectified this problem with the 2009-pres Maxima but will see if they screw it up again when the Altima is redone again for 2012 model year. Acura did the same thing to their flagship right now (the RL) with the current TL in the regards you pointed out. "

"marcus216","August 2010"," I don''t think comparing the TL to the A4, S4, 3 series, or G37 is an accurate comparison due to the fact the the TL is considerably larger. Why not compare the new Infiniti M series to the S4 or a Mercedes E 350 to a G37? The only thing the TL has in common with the smaller cars is price. I would not expect a TL to be able to run a slalom course with any of the above cars due to the shear bulk of the TL compared to the others. 0-60 times have the same issue. I could care less whether a TL can beat an S4 to 60 mph. My TL SH-AWD comes close to equaling most performance measures of an S4 . And when I entertain clients, I can put two full sized adults in the back seat of my TL in comfort. And the list price of my TLwas about $9,000 less than a comparably equipped S4. "

"sweendogy","August 2010"," why do they make the RL then?? I think its great that the TL is roomy but so is a buick, In comparison tests the TL always ranks lower then cars in its price class-(as noted in the 3 links i posted)-the class acura put this car in from the beginning --as an entry level lux sedan -- this is the class that makes it possible for other cars under the lux line to exist because they sell alot of them.. if your driving an automatic TLAWD and think it will outperform a S4, then you never drove an S4,-- TL is a good middle of the road sedan, in manual form its comes closer to S4 but no one here on these chats ownes a 6speed (infact one in 6k comes in manual....ronn knows this stat).. edmunds reviewed the 6speed-- its a different animal.http://www.edmunds.com/acura/tl/2010/testdrive.html "
"marcus216","August 2010"," Before my TL SH-AWD purchase, I drove every midsize luxury performance sedan out there. E350, 5 Series, M37, Audi A6, GS 350 to name a few. And, in my opinion, the TL in terms of power, handling, comfort, amenities, and over all luxury feel is in the ball park with all the cars mentioned here. Now, if price were not a consideration, would I choose the TL over a 5 series or A6, probably not. But the TL is $10,000+ less comparably equipped. That is a huge advantage. Another advantage to the TL that the others don't have is the SH-AWD. When you take a corner hard in the TL, it almost defies physics as you can feel the outside wheels forcing the car into the turn. It is a unique feeling and makes for a fun drive. I also drove a Buick LaCrosse and with the exception of a beautiful interior, the LaCrosse does not measure up to the TL in performance areas and is not the same type of car, more of a nice luxury sedan. Regarding the RL, that is a dated design that needs a change. I assume the next gneration RL will be a step up in size and maybe power from the current TL to differentiate it. But who knows. Again, the TL does compare well to the other sedans. It is a tremendous value in this very competitive segment. "
"billyperks2","August 2010"," That's why I dont read those silly comparison test because it is just useless to the everyday driver. Is anyone really going to be going 0-60 in 5 seconds on the highway? Is anyone really braking at 114 ft from 0-60? Is anyone doing 0.84g in a sloam with their cars? Unless you take the car over to Skip Barber race track, then these things become a reality.Secondly, did they test the 328I manual 6spd and the Audi manual against the TLAWD? I am guessing they did. They need to test a 328xi automatic and audi automatic AWD against the TL AWD. "
"slance66","August 2010"," The cars they choose to review are annoying. Almost always a manual transmission, which few Americans buy, almost always the most powerful, top of the line car, again usually a low volume car. Like the CTS-V for example. Do they sell any? I'll see BME 550 and 535 reviews, but none for the much more popular 528. Same with the 335 and 328. They need to test the cars most people will buy, equipped in the way most people will buy them.

"nyccarguy","August 2010"," He actually USED to drive a TSX. He sold it and bought an E30 M3 (no further explaination needed).The chat is ENTRY LEVEL LUXURY PERFORMANCE SEDANS (not for the Money).I think it is a fantastic category. Each car is different in its own way. Each car is better in its own way. Different things matter to different people as far as entry level luxury performance sedans go. I'd be happy with most of them.Yes BMWs do get pricey if you load them up with lots of goodies, but the chassis dynamics & balance of a 3 series (even a 328i) make it WELL WORTH the price of admission. Not only does a 328i handle extremely well, but it also rides comfortably. Tremendous brakes & wonderful steering are 3 series hallmarks. The 3 is a great car for 1 person or if it is a 2nd car, I think personally the E90 sedan is on the small side. There are other costs to consider besides the price paid for the car. BMW includes scheduled maintenance. Check out the prices of CPO 3 series vs. a CPO G. If you've got the time, European Delivery is available for the BMW & now you're talking 335i car for 328i price. The 3 also gets decent fuel economy. 6 Speed stick availability is a BIG PLUS for me. I have a terriffic service advisor at BMW that treats my family and I like royalty. ""What's that Bradd, your Dad drove over an 2x4 in the snow that busted his radiator on his X5 and he's stopped in the middle of the bridge in a snowstorm? He's OK? Good. Are the dogs with him? You're in the towtruck?"" There were no service appointments available for 4 days and no loaner cars available for at least a week and a half. I drove out of the dealership in an hour with a loaner car which they let me keep for the 3 & a half weeks my Dad's truck was being fixed. I agree with you that for the money, the G37 is very hard to beat. I've been on Infiniti's ""build your own"" site and my ideal G37S 6 Speed has an MSRP of $39K and change. You can buy the car for what, $36K? I've driven a G37X before. I love the accleration. The car is extremely well balanced & feels like it turns on an axis. The VQ isn't nearly as smooth as the BMW I6 & it guzzles gas (even with a 7 speed automatic). 6 Speed stick availability is a plus for me.The A4 is a nice car too. Very roomy compared to the 3 & the G. Rides smooth. Brakes don't have the bite of the 3 or the G. Amazingly finished interior, gorgeous materials. A very sharp looking car with the S Line Sports Package. Turbo With 258 lb ft torque & great highway mileage. Even though all the others offer AWD, they offer it because of QUATTRO. My Mom had an '02 A6 and I'm nowhere near impressed with Audi's customer service.I actually think the IS is a handsomely styled car. LEXUS came so close with the 1st generation IS, that I was disapointed with the second gen version. It has aged well though. The IS350's accleration rivals that of the G37 & 335i. The interior is well finished, beautiful, and very comfortable. The back seat is about as useful as my Prelude's. They do offer some type of Sports Package that supposedly makes the handling razor sharp. There is something to be said about LEXUS reliability too. The IS250's 204 hp V6 is laughable at this price point. Not only is it snail slow, but doesn't get that good gas mileage. 6 speed stick only available on the IS250. Brakes are instant on with ZERO linear feel, but they do stop the car now. I felt the handling to be disconnected.Say what you want about the TL SH AWD, but it is the only one of these cars that is real sized. Gonna go out with another couple? The other 3 people will vote Acura every day of the week and twice on Sunday. It has a big trunk too. Available 6 speed stick w/ SH AWD makes it very competitive in this segment.

"kfdmed","August 2010"," BMW's are butt ugly, ride harsh, and cost a boat load of money to maintain/service (after the free stuff).

The RWD/FWD debate is overrated much like the manual/auto trans debate.Yes I know how to shift gears and work a clutch. Yes I have driven rear wheel cars. No, I am not sixteen anymore and don't care to drive like I am on the autobahn.The TL/AWD, CTS/4, and G37X are the best choices. The Germans are just ugly/boring and expensive.

"ivan_99","August 2010"," ""I would think that to be a very heavy vehicle with (280 hp?) not enough motivation""Yeah...I think that motor has been around for 5 years or so; time to upgrade i think. But still not too far behindI thought about a CC 2.0T and chipping it...making a fun project car. But when they first came out you couldn't get the Nav system (really nice) with a manual. Their auto wasn't the DSG...just a regular 6spd (plus my wife was giving me a hard time about a 4 seater)I had a few cars between the old G35 and IS350 (I have a problem).I did a CPO for the IS350. I was looking at CPO'd 335's...coupe. I was scared off by the maintenance stories (the IS has not been perfect...even requiring a tow truck--boost). I thought the BMW was gorgeous, but didn't care for the interior. The Lexus CPO was better than the BMW and one of the 335's I drove was only auto (i know like the IS  ). The manual 335 i drove was a base...again the interior threw me off. Materials and quality were good, it just didn't look right to me (or not as good as others...although i'm tiring of the IS interior...that problem i have) .An A5 would have been my first choice, but the price got too high (the S5 was a dream to drive---felt like James Bond  ). The new A4 wasn't out yet...love the recent Audi's. I really liked the CTS as well; it just didn't feel as good as the others The new MB C was out, but I couldn't find a price similar to the IS's CPO (they were too new) -- it drove similar to the IS.I probably wouldn't buy another IS today. I get very annoyed by Auto trannies; they never do what i want them to. I can rant even further about the shiftable auto trannies like the IS and CTS (etc)...shift...wait...wait...wait...wait...gear change (if you ever see a grown man screaming at the shift leaver...that is me  ) BTW -- Like the DSG I can't drive the IS in 'normal' mode...i have to leave it in 'power' mode. This alters the throttle response (makes it shift less smooth -- sometimes jerky ). In normal mode I feel like i'm going to loose my mind; think driving a Corolla in the sand. The traction control comes on WAY too early (this is an 06); I believe they altered it for other years. You can disable the traction control...through an esoteric sequence of brake and parking brake taps...at every startup.The thing I like the least is the low torque at normal driving speeds. If you squeeze the pedal too slow you're left wondering if something is wrong. You have to learn to tap it just right to get a one or two down-shift.If you keep the pedal down and past 4K the thing flys; but at this point you're getting into triple digits and you'll need a good layer and a lenient Judge...mommy why's daddy in jail...During my test drives i was a maniac so I didn't notice the little nuances in 'normal' driving; which I suppose we all have to do at some point But it's an ok car...I like it...looks nice, interior is fine. Goes fast when I need to. My average mileage is 22ish which i'm content with.Think my next car will have to be a coupe...or a tunned up turbo something...or both "

I had a 2003 accord -- 4 cyl 5 speed (I run the gamut from mid-end to affordable low end...); funny thing is I made *sure* with my wife that the manual was fine...took about 3-4 months...then after we got it...""I can't believe I have to use the clutch with my bad knees"" :confuse: We already had a mini van...so I thought -- why do i need another family car...and it wentThen it was a Mazda 3i 5speed sedan. Great car, one of my favorite...it was like the whole body was carved out of one piece--very solid and composed. I took a test drive, didn't look in the trunk or try the stereo or sit in the back seat...was very impressed (sport package) and said ""I'll take it"". Fun car (more than my IS)...but the engine was lacking (didn't care for the hatch which is where the 3SPEED was limited to) and it was too buzzy on the highway (really needed a 6 speed).Then it was an Infiniti Q45. V8 was very nice...but way too quiet. Car wallowed a bit too much. It was luxurious, but I quickly felt like an old man. When I had this I was at a VW dealership with a co-worker and the salesman convinced me to take a test drive (he didn't have to try hard) . I took a VW Fahrenheit GTI and loved the burble sound of the engine compared to my quiet V8.I still would have kept the Q45 longer except I had an encounter with a deer...nobody tells you the air bag could rip all the hairs off your arms with friction...think wax scene from 40 year old virgin...The longest I've kept a car (other than our min-van) is almost 3 years...a 99 1/2 Audi A6; 10 years later and i still think the interior is one of the best out there.I'll probably keep the IS longer...it's a CPO which isn't transferable. So you end up paying a few $k more than 'normal' when you purchase it. I'm tired of being 'upside down' when trading in so i figure I picked it for a reason...and those reasons must have been valid at the time...basically talking myself out of going car shopping; which I enjoy...i can take a new mini-van out and have a good time.

"nyccarguy","August 2010"," to check out the C300 Sport w/ 6 speed stick tonight. They had it advertised in the paper for $309 per month for 36 months. Now this is for 10K miles per year, paying the taxes up front, with a $1999 cap cost reduction.They did actually have 2 C300 w/ 6 Speed sticks on the lot. The car is really nice. Very handsome & aggressive looking. I really like the headlight cluster and the big 3 pointed star in the middle of the grille. Roomier inside than an E90 3 series. The trunk was quite large for a car of this class & size. Interior materials were very high quality. The MB Text seats were traditional ""Benz Rock Hard.""The salesman promptly offered me a test drive, which I declined until we ran the numbers. So once he taylored the lease figures to meet my needs: 15K per year for 3 years, $0 Cap Cost Reduction, MB Maintenance (residualized in the lease), sales tax, the payment became $460 per month. Which actually isn't bad for a $35K Mercedes, but nowhere near the screaming deal I'd have to bring home to the Board of Directors (she gets 2 votes, I get 1).

MPG's and legroom are great but so is performance and looks -- I would put this new TL on par with the buick/lexus ES category except they are better looking cars-- i think the real comparison should be the lincoln mkz-- both are larger then entry level sedans, 40k and offer an upgrade engine that only really come in automatics (one in 6k Tl's sold comes in manuals/have yet to find one here on edmunds). They are both middle of the road performance sedans (look at the reviews)/The G does eat gas for sure-(i get 18mpg most fillups)-and the reason why you see more G's is because they trounce acura TL in sales. (billy i posted the numbers on another chat) To knock the auto is a joke because the TL has a 5 speed auto from the accord.-- and if you see one on a rental lot you should rent it and flog the snap out of it..

"jtla","August 2010"," sween, if I remember correctly, you have the 2008 G35, right? The 7AT in the 2009+ improves the mileage notably. The EPA rating for the 2010 G37 sedan is 19 city/27 highway. In real world, I can get 21 MPG average on 40/60 city/hwy. I think it is pretty good for a 328 HP performance sedan. As to the 7-speed transmission, I did not experience the ""gear hunting"" some people mentioned here. In the ""D"" mode, it has adapted to my driving style and shifts at higher RPM than in the break-in period. Occasionally I will use the paddle-shifters to down shift for highway passing. IMO, the combination of 7AT and the paddle-shifter is about the best you can get -- short of manual tranny. "
"sweendogy","August 2010"," billy, good comeback.. always insightful with tons of facts, smart people should also look at the sales numbers and performance numbers-- but i do agree with you that safety is important as well.JTLA- yeah i have the old 5speed auto-- wish it had 2 more gears but cant justify trading in a car thats paid for and has no miles on it for extra 2-3 mpg. "
"marcus216","August 2010"," I respectfully disagree regarding performance of the TL against other premium performance sedans. My neighbor has a 2009 BMW 535 IX and I have driven his car and he has driven mine. Acceleration in a bit better in the BMW, but not much and my TL handles almost as well as his BMW. Now, am I saying that the TL is a better performing car, no. But it is fairly close. So to say that the TL is better compared to a Buick or Lincoln than a 5 Series is, in my opinion just not accurate. "
"jtla","August 2010"," Certainly no need to trade in a 2008 for a 2010. They are still basically the same car. The point I was trying to make was that the G, especially the current model year, is not nearly as gasoline thirsty as some may think. "
"roadburner","August 2010"," That is, until you get one with a manual transmission. Then your jaw drops. I was being facetious; 3 of my cars are manuals, and only one is FWD. "
"sweendogy","August 2010"," your free to have an opinion -- and I do think the TL has its good points vs BMW (one big one being price for sure) but its blood lines dont make it a true performer (thats why it NEVER wins in comparo tests)--- its an accord (not a bad thing, billy loves its safe nature, and lord knows its a proven platform)what about the lincoln mks with awd and the SHO engine-- 350/350 hp/torque vs 305/265.. 6speed vs 5, both big and have pushed the styling to the obsurd.. i would bet the acura handles a little better but the MKS can park itself..Buick offers the LaCross CXS which if you look close tops the base acura TL in HP--has a 6speed auto and starts at 29kk (which is 6k cheaper then base TL) and if you put the cars sidebyside (exterior) and took the badges off you would think the buick was more money. "
"billyperks2","August 2010"," Okay let me try and understand what you are saying.Before you go out to purchase an automobile you research how many units been sold and the performance of the car.So basically you are telling me if the Pontiac Aztec sold a zillion units, returned a time of 0-60 in 3.2 secs, skid pad 0.84g and braking from 0-60 at 112ft - you have to get one? oh really?I thought normal people picked their cars by their taste, budget and what fits their lifestyle. Secondly you keep harping on the 5 speed auto- what's wrong with it? Do you think 15 gears make a car better? I think the gear ratios are remarkable in the TL- at 85mph my tach is hardly at the 2500 RPM. Try doing 85mph on your G, probably you will be cranking 4000rpm easily.When will Nissan- oh I mean Infiniti get their math correct? Can they make a car that does not harm the enviroment- all that gas guzzling just destroys the ozone-GOSH, get it right Maxima- oh, I mean G35. "
"marcus216","August 2010"," Bloodlines in automobiles don't really mean much to me. How a 2000 BMW 5 Series compared to a 2000 TL does not apply to how current models compare to each other. BMW 5 Series has always been the standard bearer for luxury performance sedans. My point is that my 2010 TL SH-AWD compares very well to a 2010 BMW 535IX in acceleration, handling, over all drving dynamics, interior appointments, and build quality. One can call the TL and ""entry level"" performance sedan because of the price point, but in real world driving, it measures up quite well. Regarding the Buick Lacrosse, I looked at it when I was car shopping. I would call the LaCrosse and ""entry level' luxury sedan. It is more Lexus like. It is a comforable highway cruising car with a great interior, decent handling and driving dynamics. It has a totally different feel than a 5 Series or TL SH-AWD. And probably appeals to a different buyer. I was looking for performance more than luxury and TL delivers in that department quite well.FYI, I also shopped the Taurus SHO. Now that was an interesting car. Extremely large, but drove much smaller. Absolutely killer engine. Nice interior and the Ford SYNC system is great. I might have leased one except that the TL came in almost $200 per rmonth less for cars that had similar list price and similar equipment. "

For someone like my mother, who wants a car like the G37 but without the 300+ HP, since she's just using it around town, it's perfect.EDIT - Japan's site says that the car gets an average of 24mpg combined(converted to US gallons).

Any opinion on the durability of the 3.2 vs. 2.0 engine and general quality of the new vs. old A4 versions or either Audi vs the BMW? Seems that people tolerate BMW repair issues better than Audi but I don't get it. Thanks.. "
"sweendogy","August 2010"," tomorrow i will be taking a long distance trip and report back the RPM at 75-100mph -- but as you JTLA has posted the infiniti engine, while being more powerful gets about the same MPG as a FWD TL according to the EPA-- billy once again posts are without underlying information. To say nissan is killing the environment is a joke as all cars are subject to the same government mandate. An Aztec did not sell due to its odd looking exterior, i did not buy one -- similar to whats happening with the current TL, styling killing sales right now.And on the maxima it might share a similar engine but power goes to the rear on infiniti cars as noted before. edmunds link -- http://www.insideline.com/infiniti/infiniti-launches-ipl-performance-line-with-g- - - -coupe.htmlThis is the first step of infiniti dominating acura once again... they were first to 300hp then 300, now move towards 350-- now i think this first attempt could of been better executed at least they are trying,something you cant say about a 5 speed auto taken from the accord and installed into acuras ""advance"" performance sedan. "
"bayman48","August 2010"," It depends, i would think the 3.2 is pretty solid, the 2.0T, while a great engine, is new. But if you like to mod, i would go with the new 2.0T A4, if you like to keep it as is, keep the 3.2, sounds like you have low mileage. I have an 09 A4 3.2, glad i could get one since they discontinued it here in the states. Repairs...if they happen, they happen, its not like repairs on a bmw is that much less expensive than on an audi. However, if you keep leasing, i guess technically, you never have to pay for repairs since it will always be under warranty. "
"sweendogy","August 2010"," 3500.. not much time spent at that speed due to lots of Mass traffic/law enforcement. Plus with the new Radar my V1 is basically useless. Avg 21 mpg on the highway over 200 miles "

"billyperks2","August 2010"," Okay Infiniti is a much more superb and dominant than Acura- I concede, lets move on. "
"sweendogy","August 2010"," billy it takes a real man to admit they have made mistakes (i.e. leasing that car).. we have room for you over in the performance group.trade that pig in.join us "
"billyperks2","August 2010"," In case you did not get the memo, I bought my TL, in addition I put over a thousand more in accessories on it. Wood Wheel, Wood Gear Shift Knob, Mud Flaps, Weather Mats,Back Up Sensors and 35% tint all around (except for windsheild).Let me tell you, this is one sweet masculine hell of car. Oh, I almost forgot, bought the Bright Whites Bulbs for the Rear License Plate and I am also going to get those really nice genuine Acura seat covers for the rear seats-kids can do damage back there.So whenever you see me coming down the highway (White Diamond Pearl SH-AWD) get that wimpy outdated Maxima oh sorry,G35 out of the left lane.PS- remember the allotment they gave you when you signed your lease-10k miles or .20cents for every mile over, so be careful with your mileage or you will be dipping in the kid's college fund. "
"kfdmed","August 2010"," Why do you insist on calling the G and outdated Maxima? They have virtually nothing in common except for similar engines. "
"smarty666","August 2010"," Billy, I understand being annoyed with him, b/c he does come on and put down/belittle people who are buying the new TL and Acura in general, but you don't need to sink to his level and start putting down him and his vehicle. Be the better person!  "
"billyperks2","August 2010"," Same bones- VQ 3.5 engine, I think now its 3.7 but its the same engine, I think the current Maxima interior is a step up from the G35 interior. Same engine is in the Quest, Altima and the rest of the family.So I dont know why G owners think the G is apart from the Nissan family. "
"billyperks2","August 2010"," Some times you get the hunch to defend your vehicle but I guess you are right- why stoop? "
"smarty666","August 2010"," Listen, I'm kinda of in the middle of this b/c I have a TL (3G), a Infiniti, and the new Maxima. Having vehicles from all three makes, each automaker has pros and cons compared to the other one. One isn't dramatically better then the other. They each do certain things better than the other so it's just a matter of what things your really want or are willing to sacrifice. I'm just trying to keep the peace I guess. "
"kfdmed","August 2010"," But the G is RWD/AWD vs. FWD Maxima and has a 7-speed vs. CVT. Given the choice I would take a TL SH-AWD first, a G37X second, Maxima third and a base TL fourth if money was no object. I have a limited budget so the Maxima worked for me best. I liked the interior size of the TL except for the trunk size over the G37X. The G is a bit cramped inside. The Maxima has the best overall style inside and out and is just the right size ... and it has the superior glove box .... it's huge.  "
"jtla","August 2010"," smarty, I am with you on this. Keep your cool, billy.I owned both Maxima and Accord in the past, and bought a 2010 G37S in March -- would have chosen TL SH-AWD had it been the same size as the 3G TL. Personally, I like the intimate feel in a cabin. Some may think the interior of G37 is cramped, but coming from a 2007 BMW 328i, it feels spacious to me.A friend of mine is considering the BMW 5-series, but I strongly recommend the TL to him and save the $10k-$15k. I think I almost sounded like a Acura salesperson.There isn't any bad car in this class, just personal preference. "

"billyperks2","August 2010"," Who said I was heated- I don't take any of this stuff personal, I do this for fun entertainment and information.

"mdx_tl","August 2010"," It's quite an entertaiment here in this forum. I admire people that think Acura is not the same class with Infiniti.  :P Poeple please help me, what's wrong with me?

"2233","August 2010"," Through the years I've owned a Toyota Supra, an Acura TL, Acura CL, an Acura MDX and a 2004 Infiniti G35 and my wife has a 2007 G35. Owned several Accords and a Prelude. All nice cars.However, the transmissions went out after the warranty on the TL and the MDX. We had a great deal of problems with the CL. The transmission went out on my brother's MDX and his Accord. All of these transmission blow ups occurred shortly after the extended warranty ended.Older Accords were bulletproof and unbelievably reliable. Transmission problems there now too.The Infinitis are fun to drive, reliable, great looking, and reasonably priced. MPG suffer a bit but it's not bad. Their AWD is amazing and the car is 100% rear wheel drive unless it detects a need to use the front wheelsWhen the new body style on the G37 sedan comes out in a year or two, I will be one of the first in line to test drive it. "
"2233","August 2010"," I forgot to mention another important point.Infinitis (and Nissans) have timing chains. Hondas And Acuras have timing belts.Timing belts are $600-800 to replace and if they break, it probably will cost you a new engine.Timing chains are virtually indestructible. "
"fedlawman","August 2010"," Not all Honda/Acuras have timing belts. For example, the RDX and 4 cylinder TSX use a timing chain.Even though the timing chains are generally lifetime items, one should replace tensioners and guides every 100,000 miles. The Infiniti uses 3 timing chains, and replacing the tensioners and guides involves removing the exhaust, starter, AC compressor and upper oil pan - about 11 book hours. How much do you think your dealer will charge for that?!?! "
"2233","August 2010"," I wasn't aware that the 4 cyl TSX and the RSX use a timing chain.I've never heard of a timing chain breaking or needing replacing. It may be expensive if it did happen but it rarely happens. Timing belts are a maintenance item and are expensive to replace. If the timing belt breaks while you are operating the vehicle, a new engine will generally be required. I've heard of many timing belts breaking which cause at minimum a bent valve, a hole in your piston or a need for a total engine overhaul.If you are lucky and your Acura timing belt does not break, you can use the money you save to buy a new transmission. Check the Acura posts if you don't believe me. "
"duke39","August 2010"," Until Acura gets the transmission issues of the MDX, RL, and TL resolved, I would never consider an Acura.Many TLs are on their 3rd transmission according to this Edmunds site. "
"fedlawman","August 2010"," ""I've never heard of a timing chain breaking or needing replacing. It may be expensive if it did happen but it rarely happens.""Replace your timing belt every 6 years or 100,000 miles (whichever comes first) and it will be as reliable as a chain.""Timing belts are a maintenance item and are expensive to replace.""A basic timing belt service will run $300 at an independent mechanic. You'll only pay $600 if you include a new tensioner, idler pulley, serpentine belt, and water pump.Have you priced new tensioners, guides, serpentine belt, and water pump for the Infiniti?  "
"2233","August 2010"," The Acura's with timing belts are interference types which means you will likely need a new engine if your belt breaks. Not so with chains.Have you priced new engines for an Acura?How about new transmissions for an Acura?. "
"fedlawman","August 2010"," Gravity pulls objects down, so if lightning strikes the tree next to your driveway and the tree falls on your Infiniti, you'll likely need a new car. "
"smarty666","August 2010"," The major/widespread transmission issues with Acura vehicles ended in either 2005 or the 2004 model year. People with 2006+ model years are not running into transmission issues like you guys are trying to imply. Go and check CR's reliability history charts for all the Acura models and you'll see that. Starting with the 2006 model years, the transmissions got above avg or much above avg ratings. If you look at the charts, the black dots for transmission issues were for 2004 model year and earlier. I have had two TL's so far, one which had a lot of miles on it, and had absolutely no issues. Get your facts straight before you go bad mouthing an entire brand. To anyone else, if you get an Acura model 2006+, you'll have little to no worry about transmission issues. Very very reliable vehicles. "
"2233","August 2010"," I guess you neglected to check the Acura transmission problem section on Edmunds.There are many posts about transmission and clutch problems in 2006 vehicles, not just 2005 and prior models.Remember, it took several years before the transmission problems surfaced regarding the transmission failures of TLs from 1999-2005. Now the problems with the 2006 transmissions are surfacing. Next year we may hear about problems from 2007.Acura's customer service and care are terrible at the national level also. "
"smarty666","August 2010"," Trust me, Acura customer service is ten times better than anything I've gotten from both Infiniti or Nissan when I've had a issue, question, or warranty problem that needed to be addressed. Acura at least pretends like they care, even if in the end, they can't help you out. Nissan/Infiniti on the other hand just flat out won't believe you and tells you anything wrong with your vehicle is normal. The customer service treatment I received from GM for almost 30 years was an abomination to say the least. Acura might not be as high as Caddy, Jaguar, or Lexus for customer service but trust me, there are much worse customer service from other companies out there! Just remember, the population sample of edmunds reports is a small minority of the total owners who have Acura vehicles and we don't here from the vast majority of Acura owners on edmunds, only a small group, sometimes only a few hundred, out of the hundreds of thousands of Acura owners. Doesn't mean there isn't a problem, but you have to take the sample size of problems with a grain of salt and try not to paint a broad brush, as your trying to do, that all Acura's are bad products. You can make this same point with any automakers and their specific problems you here complained and reported here on edmunds and then paint a broad brush about the entire automaker and try to frighten people not to get those brands: GM: numerous power steering and airbag issues in various modelsHonda: brake/rotor issues on several models Toyota/Lexus: acceleration, transmission, and safety issues Nissan: early gen CVT issues BMW: numerous electrical/sensor issues that need to be fixed Chrysler: various mechanical/safety issues across the boardInfiniti: hunting/pecking and communication issues with transmission/computerAudi: some mechanical/electrical gremlins in a more than avg chunk of its modelsthe list can go on and on for each automaker and the point is, you take your chances with anyone of them; it just depends on, what one gives you a slightly higher chance of not getting a problem model from that automaker I can tell you with having two Acura's both 2006+ that I have had no problems or no sign of problems with my transmission and I don't know anyone personally with a Honda or Acura model that has or has had transmission issues; I belong to a few Acura boards and the MAJORITY do not have transmission issues; I only have seen a few dozen over the years on those boards report transmission issues, not that they can't happen, but they are not happening left and right with every Acura model and in the intensity your trying to portray it as! "
"xeye","August 2010"," ""Acura's customer service and care are terrible at the national level also. ""I went to test drive a TL-Type S in January 2007 in Framingham, MA. The roads were clear and dry during a spell of unusually warm weather in the 70's. The torque steer was surprisingly difficult to handle to the point where I dismissed the car as an undisciplined and poorly designed automobile. Nicely appointed, but dangerous to drive aggressively.What really turned me off, though, was the attitude of the salesman who took me for the drive. Upon returning to the showroom, I wanted to know more about the vehicle and asked for the detailed brochure as I like to devour the technical details and be able to imagine myself behind the wheel. The salesman told me they didn't have any brochures, that I wasn't ready to buy and to come back when I was ready. He was arrogant and rude. He then promptly walked away leaving me thoroughly unattended.That turned me off Acuras so completely that I wouldn't even consider another dealership. Too bad as this one was less than 1 mile from my home.I then went to a local BMW dealership that I had avoided as I didn't think I could afford a BMW. I did a test drive of the 335xi. I was so impressed by the car, but more importantly, the manner of the salesman and the time he took to chat with me over the next 7 months when I would drop by that we are now on our 3rd BMW from the same dealership. ('07 335xi traded for an '11 335i xDrive, and my wife's '08 328xi).Acura? No thanks. "

"2233","August 2010"," Trust me, I've had much better customer service with Infiniti. I guess it comes down to the individual dealership so this can vary from city to city.All I know is that we had 3 Acuras and all 3 had the transmissions go out. That's my experience. Around 2003, my brother and I went shopping for an MDX for him. We asked about the reported transmission problems in the TLs from 2000 and 2001. The salesman was adamant that the problem only existed in the early 1999 and 2000 transmission in the TL. He indicated that there were no problems in the later TLs and never in the MDX.Guess what? My brothers MDX's transmission went out last year. Now we see 2006 transmission problems with the TL. Keep us posted in a couple of years on your TL or an MDX if you own one. It takes 4 years for this problem to manifest itself and become public. I am in contact with the NHTSA re any deaths or injuries from the TL trans failures.Hopefully you will be lucky. My family is batting 1000 with 3 for 3 transmission failures. "

"ivan_99","August 2010"," Is that transmission a manual or auto?I thought all the tranny failures for Honda/Acura were related to the Auto.Pre 2006 I knew of 4 people with an Odyssey /Pilot and they all had the trannies replaced (a close friend was on his 3rd). They were all replaced with rebuilt versions...they presumably still had the design defect.I assumed that the new versions were re-designed and 'good' now...who knows, maybe their failure rate was the same as others and the owners are just more vocal.I maybe wrong in my assumptions...but I'd be pretty PO'd if any transmission went out...at anytime throughout the life of the vehicle; of course with the caveat that you're not at the drag strip or towing 10k lbs everyday...

"2233","August 2010"," Our 3 transmissions that failed were automatic. I don't know about the 2006s though.I agree with the poster who said that all brands have their problems, quirks and nuances. How the manufacturer resolves these problems is what is crucial.I complained for 5 years about the transmission in my TL, Acura only performed a jet kit quick service of some sort. That's it. Complained constantly about the other 2 also that went out. Acura refused to replace these unless they went out during the warranty period.My daughter drove the TL and constantly called me worrying that she would not make it to her destination and would break down on an expressway. This eventually happened. Acura could have replaced this transmission with a rebuilt one and that would have satisfied me but they chose not to do so, An Acura rep in California named Ingrid took 11 days to tell me they would pay for 10% of the repair after the TL trans went out. That was insulting and waiting 11 days was inconsiderate at best.My 2004 Infiniti G35 had a well known problem with the brake pads wearing out prematurely. However, they were proactive. After I had 35,000 miles on the vehicle they contacted me and put 4 new pads and new front rotors on the car at their expense. They even gave me a free loaner and an oil change.At 68,000 miles I took the G35 into Infiniti of Ann Arbor and reported that rear rotors may need turning. I mentioned the pads and rear rotor replacement from 3 years earlier. They called Infiniti and gave me 4 new pads, turned the front rotors and replaced the rears at no cost. Incredible.Last month, we took my wife's 2007 G35 to this dealership with 40k miles on it for a front rotor turning. The service advisor said they just received a TSB indicating that a problem with the front splash guards may have caused warping of the front rotors. They replaced the front splash guards and turned the front rotors at no cost.This is truly great service. This is what we experienced with Infiniti.Disregarding constant complaints and arrogance is what we got from Acura, in addition to 3 blown transmission between my brother and us.None of us ever towed a thing nor did we abuse the Acuras in any way. Acura is not proactive and Infinti was for us. Acura should learn from the lessons re the Camry and Lexus models.

"smarty666","August 2010"," When I got my new Maxima last year, the auto up features on the front windows did not work at all. After two visits to the Nissan stealers and being told they worked fine and that it was MY FAULT they wouldn't go up in the way I was pushing the button, I called Nissan Consumer Affairs. I reported the problem to them, and without even asking me any details, they too tried to blame me and say I was not pushing the button correctly. They then went behind my back, called the stealer where I took the car and then called me back saying they talked to the stealer and they couldn't find anything wrong. About a week went by and I did some of my own research online and found a TSB put out by Nissan for the auto-up feature not working on the Maxima and what needed to be done to correct it. Printed out the TSB and took it into the stealer on the third trip, gave them the paper and threatened to get the stealership owner involved if they did not address the issue. Suffice it to say, third time was the charm on such a ridiculously non-complicated issue that both the Nissan stealer and Nissan Consumer Affairs could have addressed but do to their idiotic and poor customer service I was dismissed and blamed for my warranty problem. Doesn't get any worse then that. Never have had Acura stealer blame me for a warranty or issue on my vehicles yet.I've got 2 or 3 more issues I could describe but this specific one above is enough to illustrate my point. :shades: "
"smarty666","August 2010"," You know why you didn't have any troubles with Infiniti in regards to your brake and rotor issues, b/c I went through the same thing with them on my 2005 FX35. Every 10k miles, I had to have my brakes replaced and rotors resurfaced b/c how poorly they were made/grinded together. When ever I applied the brakes, I had this terrible grinding/shimmy through the pedals and wheels, which always indicated to me I was nearing the 10k mile mark for another Infiniti stealer visit. Luckily it was all covered under warranty which I never could understand b/c most automakers consider brake/rotor wear a normal wear and tear item which is not covered under warranty. Come to find out, there were multiple class action lawsuits against Infiniti for poor brake/rotor problems that people with early year G35 and FX35/45 vehicles had. Infiniti was not covering the brakes and rotor repairs even for people that had their brakes and rotors shot to hell after only 6-7k miles on them. Enough people sued and Infiniti was forced to settle and cover the brake and rotor repairs under warranty. It wasn't until Infiniti was forced to do the right thing that they actually stepped up and did it! Thats the reason why all those issues you had were covered under warranty at no cost to you. Enough people had problems and sued to get that stuff covered. Shame is, Infiniti continued to put poor quality brake/rotors on their vehicles all the way up to 2008 models. I've only recently seen signs that the issues on their models have changed with a changed to better quality brake/rotors on their 2009+ models and the frequency and occurrence of brake/rotor issues has dropped dramatically since the change in parts in 2009!

"puffin1","August 2010"," I had the same problem At North Hampton Acura. The Manager was under the impression I was selling my RSX Type S and untill I sold it I was no where. He said to me I wasn't ready to deal. He was a turkey from MA. (arrogant) I had $33000.00 in my checking account my wife was looking to buy a TSX. What a nut case, he got upset because I liked a RSX and wanted to try it out.It was a 2006 used. He thought I was poor and needed a loan.He asked me if I was upside down on a loan. I got peeved and went 8 miles down Route #1 and bought my wife a new Lexus.I did have to pay 5 % sales tax in ME and I think $1200.00 in excise tax also. Prime Motors of Maine owns the place I guess they sold out in MA and bought half of the auto mile in Saco, ME I'd stay away from them. :lemon: "
"2233","August 2010"," Infiniti stepped up with me and replaced a second set of pads and rotors. The terms of the class action suit did not require this nor were they required to do anything on the 2007 Infiniti. That is the difference between Acura and Infiniti in my experience. I am commenting only on my experiences with these 2 companies. IInfiniti has resolved their issues. Has Acura?If you checked my other posts re this issue, my extended family was about as loyal to Acura/Honda as anyone in this country. I owned a total of 8 Honda/Acuras, my parents owned 2, and my 3 brothers owned a total of about 10. My brother worked for Enterprise Car Rental and purchased over 50 Hondas from our local dealership.My driveway looked like a Acura/Honda dealership at Thanksgiving. You would think that Acura would be a little accomodating and pay for half of my transmission repair. It might have cost them $1,000.My brother is shopping for SUVs as we speak and he has eliminated Honda/Acura in his search. I just bought an Altima Friday for my daughter. My other brother is looking for a sedan and has also eliminated this brand.That's 3 lost sales in 3 weeks and more lost sales are forthcoming.Good move Acura. "

"smarty666","August 2010"," I'd suggest you re-read the class action lawsuit b/c it DOES REQUIRE them to replace the brakes and rotors on the opposite axle to the drive under warranty! Since the G35 and FX35 in my case, was RWD, this covered the front brakes/rotors. I had them replaced and resurfaced for free at 10k, 20k, 30k, and 40k. Thats four times! When the rear brakes/rotors started having troubles at 20k, was told by TWO SEPARATE Infiniti stealers that, ""oh, the rear's were not covered under the class action suit b/c the vehicles were RWD!"" Called Infiniti headquarters who only confirmed what the stealers told me and despite all my problems with the fronts, even though I was still under warranty would do nothing to help pay for the rear brakes/rotors. Yeah, great customer service! Infiniti does not step up to the plate when it truly matters! That is why they are ranked at the bottom of the luxury customer service list by JD Power! No matter what automaker, you shouldn't be having brake/rotor issues at those kind of low miles anyway if they are made and put together properly. What is sad is that Infiniti could not step up to the plate until being legally forced to and actually had the nerve to tell 2003-2006 G35 and 2003-2006 FX owners that they had to pay out of pocket for brakes/rotors being shot at 7-10k miles as NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR!We used to have a lot of Nissan/Infiniti in my family, like you did with Honda/Acura and none so far have gone back to Infiniti and replaced them with Acura's, Lexus's, and BMW's. "
"duke39","August 2010"," I test drove the new TL last yearThe torque steer in the TL was so bad that I felt that I affected my control of the vehicle when it was driven aggressively.The TL tries to portray itself as a performance luxury car but it can never be a performance car with all the torque steer. If you never drive in a sporty and aggressive manner then the torque steer will not matter. But if your hoping to have a fun vehicle to drive, there are much better choices out there.A car with this much power cannot effectively use the front wheels for steering, handling and delivering power to the front end. I found the handling way too jittery. "
"smarty666","August 2010"," I've felt some torque steer but nothing to the dramatic extent your describing. It is easy to compensate for by just having two hands on the wheel when accelerating fast. Its not perfect but its not terrible either. I have the 3G Base so I can only speak for that vehicle. The Type-S had the bigger engine and displacement so I assume maybe that could have more severe torque steer. One thing I give Nissan credit for in the new Maxima, is they have virtually eliminated torque steer. A pretty impressive feet for a car with 290HP/261 lbs of torque in a FWD set-up. I have felt little to none under brisk acceleration since having it. Can't speak for the new TL since I don't have one if Acura was able to improve upon that compared to the last Gen TL. "
"2233","August 2010"," smarty 666,My point was that Infiniti made several repairs to our vehicles after the warranty expired and well after any mandate required them to do.Acura did not. Their refusal to equitably share in the repairs of the transmission occurred after we presented, in wiriting and in great detail, our documented complaints over 5 years on this transmission.This is my experience. Yours may be different. It seems we are both ""car guys"" with differing experiences who can engage in lively discussions but with different opinions.Acura is clearly having sales problems with their TL. That is not in dispute. Hopefully these discussion are read by them and they can return Acura to their prior level of quality and desirability. Hopefully Acura, Infiniti, BMW, et al read these posts and attempt to improve their transmissions, brakes, engines etc and provide better and safer cars for their customers.Loyalty is important to me and my extended family and it should run both ways. I'm sure you feel the same way. "
"smarty666","August 2010"," Couldn't agree with your last post more! I personally, after seeing first hand how the sales animals treat you, have no brand loyalty. I go where ever I like the vehicles, get the best price, treatment, etc. B/C at the end of the day, there is no brand loyalty. When you walk in to the salesman, no matter how long you've been with them, they treat you as if your there for the first time and try to screw you over. I've had it time and time again with multiple automakers.I'm sorry to hear Acura was not willing to step up and back you up. Its quite a shame. I had the same experience with Infiniti not stepping up and helping me so I guess we were the victims of the same mistreatment, just by different companies! It is a shame with the sales figures of the new TL. I too was turned away from getting one, b/c of the size increase and ugly grill, hence why I got a new Maxima, so hopefully they get the message on that one and the next gen TL will be back on track. So far, my Maxima has been fun to drive, and after 12k miles, I'm happy to say, no rotor/brake issues like I have on my FX35! Its a good thing for the class action lawsuit so that all my brake/rotor fixes were covered b/c that would have added up quickly and really hurt the bank.I'm glad, though I can't understand why it took Nissan and Infiniti over 5 years to finally put the proper type of brakes and rotors on their vehicles, that they finally have had their brake/rotor issues solved. Before 2009, it was a really serious problem on both Infiniti and Nissan vehicles. I know the 2007 and 2008 Altima's had major troubles with wear as well, but so far, since 2009 model years, I've read very few brake/rotor issues compared to years previous! It only goes to help us! "
"2233","August 2010"," I really like the new Maxima. It resembles the M37 a great deal. I didn't test drive one when searching for a car for my daughter since it was priced higher than the Altima but it's alot less expensive than the M37.Infinti's brake issues existed from 2003 to 2006 in the G. They changed the design and the pad for the 2007 model and no problems with my wife's 2007. I'm not up to speed on the FX though.I'm looking for a new car in 2011 or 2012. I think the FX is the best looking SUV ever made but some find it not attractive. Speaking of sleazy salesmen, we test drove a Camry last week also. The salesman knew me somewhat for many years having sold me a Toyotal Supra back in the 90s. He knew that I was an informed consumer.When we spoke about price, I mentioned that the dealership of a competing brand was cutting the holdback and crediting it to us in their price. He first said he never heard of ""holdback"" and when I chuckled he later said Toyota only pays $200 for holdback.I corrected him and informed him that the holdback was more than double that.We walked out. You'd think that an experienced Toyota salesman would have more sense and class but I guess I give some car salemen too much credit. "
"ctl","August 2010"," A potential TL buyer here. I would think the TL auto trans. issue is history by now, after all, they have been on the same 5 speed all these time! one would think... I wish for the new 6 speed but is a bit worried, almost everyone (benz 7, infiniti 7, toyota 6, has had issue with their newer version of auto trans when it first came out.Funny all the bittering on infiniti brake pad... now all the issues with 2008-2009 Accord brake pads (consistantly short lived, avg. 20K) makes me wonder about the TL brake pads. Haven't heard much about it yet, but watching closely. "
"2233","August 2010"," I would wait until the current body style of the TL is out for at least 4 years to assess the potential transmission issues.Remember, the 2000 + TLs took about 4 years to manifest themselves as did the MDX. "

"sweendogy","August 2010"," comments on CR reliability charts and dealership experinace==On consumer reports-- I use them for almost everything I buy, from Toasters, Tvs and cars-- i think its a great paid service that does have merit. The break and transmission issues on both the tl and infiniti-- its all about luck when getting a car - most cars have something thats going to be problem (or reported as a problem by the owners)-- no one builds a perfect car (but the accord/civic have been close).On dealerships-- well i''ve owned both acura and infiniti.. Acura has a better overall setup and you feel wanted when you drop your car off -(2 dealerships i've visited, for oilchanges only, dam i miss the GS-R)- this is my Infiniti -- well i bought my G35 at a small dealership in the middle of nowhere and they have great service but the larger in-town dealership is cold, mass marketed, non-user friendly monster. I think its more about who owns the dealership and where its located. "
"smarty666","August 2010"," As far as I know, the brake/rotor wear issues are mostly contained to the 2008-2010 Accord. I haven't heard similar problems with the 2009+ TL which I believe uses different pads/rotors from the Accord. Don't quote me on that since I don't have the new TL and not sure what was changed or not changed. But I know that current gen Accord owners are going through hell with Honda on the brake/rotor issues and Honda has not done a great job of stepping up and helping people until being forced to legally or with severe pressure from corporate Honda. Such a shame. From my own experience, both my 2006 and 2008 TL have had absolutely no brake/rotor issues at all. "
"billyperks2","August 2010"," 2009 TL AWD- 1 year and 1 week of ownership, absolutley no brake or rotar issues. "
"ctl","August 2010"," The current TL auto-trans 5speed is the same one Honda used across the board (RL, TL, Accord, Civic...), since 2000 TL! On one hand they would probably have made it to perfection by now. On the other, one would think they have extincted by now, lagging behind virtually the whole industry in the transmission area! Amazing stubbornness or confidence? :mad: maybe also they were bite hard by the early trans. issue and being cautious.As to the brake pad, if I have to bet, I would take that they share the design and parts with Account, at least the FWD version. Will be great if they didn't, but the jury is still out on this one. "

"Kirstie_H","August 2010"," That is actually my major complaint with my G35 - it chews through brake pads & rotors more than any other vehicle I've owned.Of course my major complaint at the moment is that it handles so poorly in the snow, but I knew that when I bought it. I just didn't have a lifestyle then that made it matter. "
"smarty666","August 2010"," I know exactly what your going through kristie and I feel for you. Its such a shame b/c except for the brake/rotor issues, my FX35 has been flawless and such a blast to have and drive! Luckily, all the repairs were covered under warranty by Infiniti, after the lawsuits of course, but so far, since 2009, I've read very few complaints from G and FX owners having brake/rotor issues. For 2009, Infiniti put different pads/rotors on which so far looks like solved the problems from 2003-2008 model years. Wish it didn't have to take that long but it is what it is. Sad to see Honda is doing the same thing to its Accord customers now! "

"sweendogy","August 2010"," i've had the front rotors resurfaced under warantee once at 17k miles- I thought that was a bit early... now at 22k they tell me I need rear breaks during my next oil change so I agree with you. I dont have the problem in the snow due to the fact my car is the awd-- i'm assuming you have the RWD if so it prob would handle better in the snow with a good set of snow tires.my only other grip is the MPGS- "
"Kirstie_H","August 2010"," Mine has 106K on it, so I doubt anyone will cover anything under warranty. And, considering I haven't spent a dime on the vehicle in repairs (just maintenance, wear-and-tear items), the brake issue is relatively acceptable.It's not the reason I'm likely trading in, but the snow issue is. I used to live in a suburban area, with restaurants, a bar, grocery store, and movie rental place less than 0.2 miles away - easy walking. Now I live in a more country-like setting, with nothing in walking distance, and the roads in the area just aren't great, nor do they get plowed well. Better tires would help, but not enough. 2 of our 3 vehicles don't go anywhere when it snows (both RWD), so I'm considering trading in before Winter hits. Last year was one of the 3 snowiest years on record here, so that's probably affecting my decision.MPGs aren't fantastic, but I currently do so little driving that it isn't a big deal. "
"pv2","August 2010"," Since you have a manual transmission, your car probably came with summer performance tires which are useless in the snow. Suggest you change to an all season performance tire. I have an '07 TL-S with auto, so it came with Michelin HX-MXMV all season performance tires and they work well in anything under a 6 inch snowfall. The other alternative is to havea separate set of winter tires and rims, but that can be expensive. You'll be sacrificing a tiny bit of dry performance at the limit, but that shouldn't be a big issue unless you drive very aggressily. Good luck. "
"Kirstie_H","August 2010"," It's an auto, and I did change the tires. I've had it since 2006, and it's been a great car. In fact, I've owned few, if any, cars for this long, so it doesn't bother me to start thinking about trading. Even *if* I could get it to perform OK in snow, I'd still prefer something that performs *well* in snow. Plus, we're kind of looking to make mine the ""middle car"" balance. We've got a Crossfire and a giant pick-up truck, which will likely be traded in on an even more giant pick-up truck. I'll probably looking at something that is AWD and can do some very light (waverunner) towing, but if that happens, I'll not bore this discussion's members with it. "

That the brand spanking new 5-Series has a very specific teething issue with the steering control software (which causes a pull to the right and has caused a number of folks to ask BMW to buy the car back) is A) not surprising given that it is a first year model, and  cannot be used as a metric to bolster your argument that BMWs aren't reliable.FWIW, I've had two BMWs and driven them for a combined 150,000 miles. The single unscheduled service event that I've ever had was a burned out taillight. Sounds pretty reliable in my book. "

There are reasons that those badges have certain reputations. As a former Audi owner and a current Acura owner, I can tell you that the Acura has been a LOT more reliable than the Audi. But do you know what? I MISS the Audi. It inspired more passion as its interior was nicer, its handling was better, and it was more solid. But it was less reliable and cost a lot more to fix. Sit in a Mercedes and then sit in an Acura. Can you feel the difference? I can. (and no, I've never owned a MB). Different people have different preferences. Some might want reliability or more tech gadgets. Others might want better leather or a more solid feeling or a better handling drive.

"jimbres","September 2010"," I have an '01 BMW 330i that I bought new in June of that year. Since the factory warranty ran out, in June 2005, I've spent a grand total of $1200 on unscheduled repairs. (Most of that went toward replacing a control arm, after I drove into the biggest pothole on the East Coast. Can't really blame that on the car.)That works out to a little over $19 per month, or about 60 cents per day. I spend more than that on coffee.You'll find that the 3-series is a very reliable car, particularly when it's equipped according to God's wishes - with a stick. "

"nyccarguy","September 2010"," About BMWs being unreliable and expensive to fix/maintain is just plain absurd. Not every car is perfect. For heaven's sake, my brother in law's Civic just had to have the engine replaced after it overheated, oil started gushing out from underneath it, and ceased (he's fanatical about preventitive maintenance). Should he go into the Civic forum here on edmunds and say how unreliable they are.Yes, Acura gives you more bang for the buck if you are a tech guy. But the TSX is cheaper because it is built on a FWD Honda Accord chassis. A 3 series is built on a dedicated RWD platform which is more expensive to build & design.Yes some people buy BMWs, MBs, Audis, Lexuses, Infinitis, Acuras... for the badges, but there are many who do drive them because there is a noticable difference in the steering, the brakes, the handling, the responsiveness.

"smarty666","September 2010"," I wasn't trying to make it out that prestige was the only reason but in regards to BMW and MB, when they are similarly equipped/packaged to their Acura, Infiniti, or even Audi counterparts are chosen a lot for the prestige factor for those thousands of dollars extra. For many, its not the only reason as you pointed out. For BMW, it could be for a combo of prestige and sport performance/dynamics as to why they chose their vehicle or say for a MB it could be a combo of prestige and luxury comfort. Personally, Audi to me, has sales similar still to Acura and Infiniti in quantity but even Audi is different from MB and BMW in that like the japanese, they have nicely priced trim levels that include a whole bunch of features so that you don't have to get really expensive option packages or pay extra for each luxury feature you want. But then again, you have the reliability factor with them so your right that there a huge set of factors, prestige being just one of them, to consider with each luxury automaker. I've found out recently over the years, customer service at the dealership and headquarter levels is coming into a sales factor for me because some of the companies are terrible where as others are great. "
"sweendogy","September 2010"," From the sales numbers it doesn't look like many people are buying acuras at all- regardless of prestige factor you speak of. I think for 75% of these cars (in this chat) bought new are traded in within 5 years so I think the reliability factor should be discounted-unless you are looking at used. Most come with 4yr earrantee. Most keep value well regardless of reliability in this group.I think if your looking to spend 40k on a car - you should compare what 40k buys you. A 40k BMW 335 is not going to give you the same options as a TL but will give you better performance. It's all what your looking for - performance or convenience. On a side note I think audi a4's are way overpriced for size and performance. "
"roadburner","September 2010"," That works out to a little over $19 per month, or about 60 cents per day. I spend more than that on coffee. My 1995 3 Series has 121,000 miles on it and the cost of scheduled maintenance and repairs(including four sets of summer/track rubber) averages a bit under 5 cents per mile. As for my wife's 2004 X3 2.5, at 101,000 miles the sole unscheduled repair has been a bad passenger SRS sensor- which was replaced under warranty. Maintenance costs are again averaging @5 cents per mile, and that takes into account the fact that I change the oil and filter twice as often as the SI system calls for. I better be looking for a good Chapter 7 attorney... :P In contrast, my 2007 Mazdaspeed 3 has 64,000 miles on it and it has needed a LF strut, a turbocharger, and a VVT Actuator- all before it hit 50,000 miles. "
"smarty666","September 2010"," agree sween with most, but I was only talking about the prestige factor in regards to BMW, MB, and Lexus, not Acura. Your right, Acura sales have been pretty disappointing. If they didn't have the MDX or TSX they would be in really bad shape. Now that we know they are keeping the RL, they need to focus on that and do a complete overhaul on the thing. Its killing them right now. "
"xeye","September 2010"," I drive a 2011 335i xDrive, traded in from a 2007 335xi. When I press on the accelerator, never mind stomp on it, it blows by, as if it was glued to the rails, by any Acura. I test drove both, and the performance, warranty and post-purchase feeling of complete peace leaves me with absolutely no regrets. I had really thought about driving the Super Handling what's-it-called, but the AWD handling of the xDrive is so good that it's not worth it.Acura is good, but whether the marque will endure with serious enthusiasts is debatable.

"billyperks2","September 2010"," I saw some pics of the new one, I am not sure if its going to make production.Point is- a five year old NSX will blow the doors off a 335XI. "
"shipo","September 2010"," Let's see here, forgetting for a moment that the NSX in 2005 cost well over twice the price of a 2011 335i, comparing a purpose built two-seat sports car to a four-door family/sports sedan isn't a terribly relevant exercise. That said, my bet is that a 2011 335i SP will take it to the NSX on any number of tracks, maybe even the majority of tracks. I mean geez, a couple of years ago Honda sponsored a race on a tight road course in Japan to compare their various performance cars, and a JDM Civic SI gave the NSX all it could handle. In the end, the NSX would run away on the straights and the Civic would just reel it back in on the twisty bits. "
"sweendogy","September 2010"," dont get it.. the NSX was a supercar-- just like 5 years from now the a 2010 GTR will outdo a Bmw 3 series- "
"fedlawman","September 2010"," I've always thought a better old school ""comparison"" to the 335i is the Nissan 300ZX turbo.20 years ago, Nissan built a $35,000 300 hp 3.0 litre 6 cylinder twin-turbo RWD 3500 lb. sports car. Three years ago, BMW built a 4-door version. "

"smarty666","September 2010"," If you had read the second post I put up, I said prestige was not the sole and only factor but it has a lot to do with the BMW and MB choices. If you don't think so then your just kidding yourself and if you looked closely at what I was comparing and talking about it was vehicles that were comparably equipped between the German and Japanese automakers. That means, same size engines, features, technology, etc. The Germans are always going to cost a few thousand more. It is more a statement of fact then opinion. That is just the way it is. Your absolutely right that Acura currently has lacked in the hardcore sport performance offerings of RWD and V8 but not every body needs that. I certainly have no issues with performance out of my 3G TL's but not everyone is so happy and wants more. If you want sport performance with a V8 and RWD go get a BMW or Infiniti, plain and simple. That is why there are choices in the luxury market. "
"ivan_99","September 2010"," Love the 300ZX turbo...almost bought one (used).1990 -- $35,000 = $58,000 in 2010 dollars.I remember by mid 90's they were selling for around $50k...which = $71k in todays dollars.Makes the 370Z look like a bargain (even the 3 series)...of course there are new features, equipment, safety on the new models...different times of course.Wasn't cheap. "
"fedlawman","September 2010"," Same here. I wanted a 300ZX turbo bad - and later, the Supra Turbo. Every now and then, I see a super clean one on the road and still think about maybe finding one. But you're right. The 300ZX turbo, RX7 Turbo, Supra Turbo and 3000GT were too expensive in their day. Nobody wanted to pay German money for a Japanese car. Looking back though, it's amazing how ahead of their time these cars were. "

"jimbres","September 2010"," Easy, big fella. I've been a subscriber to CR since the 1970s, & as I write this, I'm looking at the April 2010 Annual Auto Issue. For the 3-series BMW, CR's ""New-Car Prediction"" is ""Better than Average"", which happens the be the same rating that CR gives to the Acura TL & which also happens to beat the ""Average"" rating that the Toyota Camry V-6 gets.The 5-series BMW's rating is only ""Average"", but that's mainly because of problems that owners have had with its sound system. The critical major systems - engine, transmission, fuel system, electrical system, etc. - get mostly ""Much Better than Average"", with a few getting ""Better than Average"". And let's face it: a bum car stereo is annoying but it won't leave you stranded 500 miles from home. "

I don't think Infiniti is stupid enough to charge full msrp on a G25 when a G37 with incentives costs just about the same. I think the range of prices is $30-$34 thousand. It will be interesting to see how many loaded ones will be on the lots compared to mid-level trims. "
"edwardsf","September 2010"," Interesting post. A lot of strong conclusions claiming ""fact"" without any data, even opinion surveys. I bought a 3 series recently after owning an A4, and a couple of Saab 900s. I bought these previous cars after testing TLs and G35s. I certainly thought the Japanese cars were as good looking and I liked the idea of owning a less blingy, more reliable car. But I like the road feel of the European cars so I bought the Euromobiles even though they did not have as many standard toys. I never tested a Bimmer in these 3 shopping trips because I think there has been a stigma or stereotype of a haughty jerk that is connected with Bimmer drivers. So, for me at least, the BMW image was a turnoff. But I have a hearing loss and now need a quieter car. So I tested more cars this time, including the A4, TL, CC, IS, ES, and the C300. And the 3 series, even though I think the 328 sedan is the least attractive of all these cars, especially the gorgeous C and G. Not only was the 3 series quieter than all but the land yacht ES, it handled better than the C300 and the A4. It handled much better than the TL, ES and IS. The G37 had similar handling. And the 328 had better ergonomics for a 6-3 guy and better highway gas mileage/emissions than all the other cars. As another poster mentioned, the 328/325 has better Consumer Reports repair ratings than A4 and C300 and the same ratings as the Japanese cars, except for the land yacht. I bought a three year used 328i for about 50% off original MSRP. I got over the image. The bad one that is. "
"smarty666","September 2010"," Again, no body looks at all the post and picks and choose what they want to nit pick on; It is a FACT, German automobiles cost more than their Japanese counter parts with the same equipment, etc. I'm not saying nor did I say that was a bad thing, its just the way it is. All I ever mentioned was the word prestige and how that contributes a lot to German luxury sales. I did say that was not the sole and only reason that people buy German vehicles but many on here seem to have missed that. I even mentioned BMW performance/handling as a key factor in conjunction with the BMW badge as reasons why they are so successful. You as well have strong conclusions claiming ""facts"" about the 3-Series without any data. Don't get me wrong, the 3-Series is a great car but, it doesn't have better city or highway gas mileage then all those other vehicles you test drove and I find it hard to believe it has the best ergonomics for a tall person considering there are other vehicles in that class with more front headroom then the 328 where when your taller, headroom makes the most difference. Not saying the 3-Series is a bad car, it certainly has several pros over some of the other entry-level lux sedans but not in those areas you mentioned. 328i 19/28 mpg (F/R Headroom 38.5''/37.5'')G37 19/27mpg (F/R Headroom 39.1""/37.2"")A4 22/30mpg (F/R Headroom 40.0''/37.5'')C300 18/26mpg (F/R Headroom 37.1''/36.9'') TL 18/26mpg (F/R Headroom 38.4''/36.7'') IS250 21/30mpg (F/R Headroom 37.2''/36.7'')ES350 19/27mpg (F/R Headroom 37.8''/37.0'')I'm not saying I only get Japanese luxury vehicles because that couldn't be further from the truth. I've had Acura, Infiniti, Mercedes, and a Caddy so far. Unless Acura changes direction, I'll most likely be shopping Infiniti, Lexus, BMW, and Audi the next time around. "
"murphydog","September 2010"," every thing you just described here also related to buying an Acura over a Honda or Hyundai or Nissan....Find that you like your Acura - but wow, talk about the kettle calling the pot black... "
"sweendogy","September 2010"," edwards i agree about the facts statement-- poor job in this and other TL related chats getting real facts. For a laugh read the 2009 + TL chat room-- its full of how fast the TL is verse other cars, how it handles, and other fluff pieces (im banned from that chat) - Fact the 3 series (no matter what the stigma or price) is still the standard in the entry level lux group.. I think its a fantastic car myself and would of bot one but decided the extra 10-15k (i have a G35x) wasnt worth it (vs 335xi) for my needs. I think all cars in this group are good choices... but for performance its 3 series (335) then G from there you go down the line (in no particular order) and its prob IS350, 328, TLAWD, C350, and Catty 3.6.. and further down the line is (no order again) A4, CC, sabb, IS250, ES350, TL Fwd, TSX, g25, caddy 2.8, suzuki..

"smarty666","September 2010"," while that is true, Nissan, Hyundai, Honda, etc are not luxury companies so its puzzling why they would be brought up here; any luxury company in this country is going to have more prestige or what ever you want to call it from the mainstream parent company. I like the Acura I have, but nothing really from their current product line. That is not new news and not the first time I've mentioned it on here. "
"edwardsf","September 2010"," Easy now. The main message you have been communicating in many of your posts is the following: ""prestige and how that contributes a lot to German luxury sales."" And over and over. But... you cite no data to support that oft repeated claim. That is my point. Not the other strawmen you bring up. And what exactly is a ""strong"" conclusion? I made some statements such as the ergonomics are better for a 6-3 guy than the other cars. Um, okay. I got in the cars and moved the seats around. I fit in the BMW much better than any of the cars, including the A4, which I actually owned. So, the manufacturers specs are relatively meaningless. For all its warts, CR does try to deal with the manufacturer discrepancies by trying to compensate for them. But even CR does not account for sloping roof tops, which hinder vision. I take it you don't have that issue of being a big guy ....Which brings us to big highway mpg. Thanks for all your googling of stats but I don't think they help this conversation, the point of which is to share experiences and go beyond the manufacturer and EPA dynometer specs. If you look on fuelconomy.gov or at Edmunds self reporting responses, BMWs get remarkable highway mileage - and mind you, these are BMW drivers who drive fast. The 328, 528 and even 535/335s are almost legendary for getting 29-33 mpg going 70 mph. I averaged 29 mpg going from SB to SF doing about 72 mph. Sure, these are self reporting and anecdotal but the number of them certainly helped convinced me and my experience confirmed them. Again, that is what these forums are for. Also, your mpg numbers use 2 pretty suspect models. The A4 FWD, which is [non-permissible content removed] due to the fuel saving CVT and the slow, remarkably cramped, Toyota-like IS250. BTW, my post starts off referencing your apparent mission (BMWs are for prestige hungry wannabees) but mainly, I just wanted some buyers to take a look at my personal experiences. Have a glass of wine or something (after you drive that nose heavy TL, that is....) "
"edwardsf","September 2010"," Yes, performance wise, the G and the 3 series seemed much better to me than the rest. I did not test the higher end 335, IS350, C350 or TLAWD as they seemed a bit pricey to me and the gas mileage on all, except the 335 was pretty bad. I don't need AWD. So we all have our own needs, which puts us into different markets. I had never thought about it before but the TL drivers do seem to be a bit combative. I think this thread has a huge TL vs. G battle in past years. I actually like both cars (I considered both in 2 car purchases) and think that many people would be happy with either. I think the G and 3 Series are a little more engaging to drive but every once in a while, I pine for a slightly smoother car - maybe like a TL or C300. I never pine for a GM, Suzuki or Toyota.... "

Please try reading the actual posts and responding to the actual text of the posts. It make the thread go better. For instance, if I say the 328 has better highway mpg than the other cars in its class, you are not responding to that statement by saying ""the 3-Series is not the best fuel economy vehicle in its class."" That is what is called a strawman. Since you do it repeatedly, I doubt I can convince you to stop but I will try anyway. I did not refer to overall fuel economy as city mpg was not important to me in my purchase. I, like a lot of other people, drive very little city miles as I walk or ride my bike to work. If I say that the cars you selectively posted are not a good representation of the 328 competitors, you are not responding to my post by saying ""those competitor models get either better or the same fuel mpg then the 3-Series or puts them down regardless."" First, I don't know what the heck that sentence means and second, my statement stands unrefuted. But if you want putdowns, here is one for you: the IS250 is blingy Scion tC. Please don't compare it to the 3 series. Also, I agree that no one cares about one's anecdotal experiences in beating the EPA numbers. However, people do seem to care about the dozens of reports from owners that could amount to some cumulative evidence about the real world operation of the vehicle that they are considering.

"plekto","September 2010"," My real issue with the 3 series is that it's now a seriously overweight and misguided vehicle when you compare it to its roots. It just is a very fancy and plush ""sedan"". Now, it might be among the best in its class, but that's a lot like the ""class"" that includes cars like a Camry and Accord. Being the best of bland isn't what I want. And neither is ""overweight and boring euro sedan"".If you want a real sport sedan experience, you need three components(manual is a given):1 - RWD2 - Inline engine, preferably an I-6 or turbo 4 180-200HP minimum.3 - curb weight under 3000lbs.

"shipo","September 2010"," The problem is that, in this era of airbags, anti-crush passenger zones, and gizmo packed cars, I seriously doubt any company could build your ""real sport sedan"" for an affordable price.FWIW #1, the 2011 328i weighs in at 3,362 pounds, only 165 pounds more than my 1999 328i. Not too shabby.FWIW #2, the last time a 3-Series sedan with an I6 engine weighed 3,000 or less was 1991 (although the 1992 tipped the scales at 3,021 lbs.).FWIW #3, given that the MUCH more capable 2011 328i weighs only 341 pounds more than the 1992 325i, I think BMW did a pretty good job at packaging all of the new safety requirements, structural integrity and extra size. Personally if I was given the option of the 1992 or the 2011, I'd choose the 2011 every time (although I would almost immediately chuck the RFTs in favor of a good set of GFTs, a move that will knock another 25 pounds of weight off the car).

This is real easy but you seem to not understand nor would I provide links since your going to just dismiss them and thus waste my time. 1) German vehicles have lower resale values then their Japanese counterparts (look at ALG for that one) 2) On a whole, the German manufacturers still do not have the long-term reliability and less problems their Japanese counterparts have ON AVERAGE (look at CR long-term reliability history charts specifically). Can also say, the chance of getting a problem littered German vehicle is still slightly higher than the chance of getting a problem littered Japanese vehicle3) similar equipped BMW/MB and Japanese vehicles do not cost the same amount with the Germans having a few thousand price premium (just build them on each website with same equipment to find this out) Those 3 FACTS indicate that, SIMILARLY EQUIPPED Japanese vs German luxury vehicles are giving the Japanese a better financial decision to get. But, there are a lot of people not choosing the Japanese vehicle and opting for the more expensive, more depreciating, higher chance possibility of problem littered German vehicle. Some people making that decision HAVE to be doing based on the prestige/ reputation factor that MB and BMW have. Now, as you conveniently leave out every post you respond to and don't say, I've said time and time again, not ALL people are making that decision based on prestige, though you are trying to make it out that is what I'm saying; I've said before, some are making that decision for other reasons, like performance advantage, luxury comfort factors, etc but prestige is a factor. Maybe its not called prestige, maybe its called something else, you can make up your own word, I don't care, just get over it. Again, you took my comment out of context that I said at the end of my post to try and make it appear I'm anti-German and that couldn't be further from the truth "

I do agree with you about the value of German engineering and as I mentioned before, that is definitely a factor when purchasing one of their vehicles for many people, myself included. I would have not tried that Mercedes a few years ago if it wasn't. At least in my case, prestige did play a part in getting that MB because in conjunction with the luxury precision comfort MB's are known for.

"smarty666","September 2010"," Have to agree with most of what you say. My whole point is that it comes down to choices in the luxury market and as you pointed out yourself, it all comes down to what each persona personally is looking for in a luxury vehicle.

You cannot get an Acura or Infinity with an in-line 6 engine. The VQ is a thrashy mess, and the Acura V6 is fine, but it's no inline.Now the I-4 in the TSX is a sweet engine - especially when mated to their excellent 6-speed manual.

"shipo","October 2010"," I'm thinking the only engine ever made that might go 400,000 miles with no oil changes is the old Chrysler 225 Slant-Six. Oh! And the Lexus engine of course. :PThen again, once the sparkplug tube seals and that looong valve cover gasket dried out and cracked, the 225 would need a quart of oil every several hundred miles just to replace what got through the seals.

"sweendogy","October 2010"," by my count 2011 is a year that brings nothing really new.. the new S60 ""naughty volvo"" kind of cool i guess but its not going to win in performance. Lexus IS has new commercials that talk about its new performance package but its the same car... The G changed the front end a bit for 2010, but nothing has really changed-- i guess the new performance line is kind of cool but the sedan is not part of it... The Caddy has no changes planed, Acura TL will have to wait until 2012 for the nose job but nothing in the blood work..Audi looks like they dropped the v6 option for the A4. BMW has new ""s"" models but again the sedan not involved in the changes.. any thoughts?? "
"xlu","October 2010"," Here are the facts in the great Japanese vs German luxury debate! 1) Japanese vehicles have higher residual values then German vehicles still 2) The CHANCE of getting a problem littered German vehicle is still higher than a Japanese one and a higher CHANCE of having more expensive/numerous long-term reliability issues 3) when similarly built up with the same size engine, features, content, navigation, etc the German vehicles cost a few thousand more than their Japanese counterparts All these fit the descriptions of any appliance....Here are some facts about German cars;1) They handle better; the car is part of the driver; it goes where the driver wants to go; the driver feels what car is doing.2) They give passion to the drivers. I only see my wife smiling while driving a BMW, any BMW, in all the test drive events.3) They look better from outside; tight body, short overhang, creative curves.4) They look better from inside; tasteful usage of wood, metal, color and texture.5) They have higher prestige.In short, the Japanese cars are for people who just want a tool from point A to point B. German cars are for people who love to drive to any points in style. "
"gbriank","October 2010"," 1) I'd have to agree. BMW has the best handling car out there (better than an Acura...and I've owned two...TL and RL).2) Not sure about passion, but definitely allows the driver to push the limits while driving with confidence3) Designs are more evolutionary than revolutionary, but that's not a bad thing.4) In my opinion, BMW interiors are very sedate and understated. My only gripe is the radio system. Without having read the manual, I challenge anyone new to BMW to figure out how to change the radio station.5) Living in Dallas, BMWs are everywhere! Prestige factor is lower here. "
"ivan_99","October 2010"," I'm on the Lexus now (1.5 years)...I usually don't keep them long. I have the intention to...but then something comes up where I decide a change is needed. The Audi (A6) duration was 2.5years or so; an A4 was in there as well...was only 1.5 years duration.Although I do have a mini-van since 2005...probably will keep it for another 5 years... "
"smarty666","October 2010"," Can't argue with any of that!  "
"smarty666","October 2010"," I would agree with you on points 1 and 2 for the most part but not on 3, 4, and 5. There are Japanese offerings from at least 1 of the 3 companies that can match the Germans in points 3, 4, and 5. Lexus definitely has the prestige factor or so many people would not flock to them month after month for most of their products have such souless driving. I feel the same way about MB but they do a little bit better job of not making the drive as boring as Lexus does but do not come close to Audi, Infiniti, or BMW when it comes to driving dynamics and sport performance. Infiniti gives passion for the driver, but if you have never had one you would not know that. I've raced many BMW's in my time with my Infiniti and have beaten many of them. Its a really fun to drive and I smile a lot when in it so there are Japanese vehicles that offer that passion and fun factor for the driver. In regards to point 3, Infiniti has really nice looking vehicles, tight bodies, and many sporty curves to them. BMW used to really lack in this area until the new 3 and 5 series which finally have some nice curves in their body styles and I quite like the looks of both of them now on the outside. Audi's body styles are really nice as well. In regards to point 4, the only German make who has a gorgeous interior is Audi. BMW is still on the plain side with little textures, color in their interiors and just are functional. Luckily they use high quality materials and little plastic which helps the blahness and makes the interior's livable and presentable. MB is using too much plastic like Acura does now on the interiors which is disappointing and a turn off for me. The new M from Infiniti has a really nice textured/high quality interior which competes finally on par with the Germans. Lexus has nice/high quality interiors as well depending on the model you get. There are plenty of Japanese vehicles that are for people who love to drive to any points in style, you just don't care to look for them. Talk about a rash generalization. "
"tlong","October 2010"," In regards to point 4, the only German make who has a gorgeous interior is Audi.IMHO MB interiors are much nicer than Lexus. They also smell much richer, something about differences in the leather. "
"plekto","October 2010"," There are a few exceptions from time to time, though. The IS300, for instance, was awesome when it was released. The IS250/350 somehow lost that ""Euro"" feel and magic to it. I think it's more than just designing a car to handle well. I think it's that BMW and Mercedes know how to balance all of the factors so that none of them really stand out. ie - you get a solid B+ rating in everything and so it feels poised and has the same feel to it.A good analogy is a band. If one instrument stands out badly , it kind of ruins the thing. Japan usually gets only a couple of areas wrong, and sometimes manages this balancing act. GM -well, they're lucky if the band is in tune most days. :P "
"tlong","October 2010"," GM -well, they're lucky if the band is in tune most days. They sometimes play really well, it's just that the band has trouble getting through a song before one of the members goes unconscious from an overdose. :P "
"smarty666","October 2010"," Perhaps but they don't use enough high quality materials like BMW and Audi do consistently throughout the cabin. I've found way to many cheap imitation plastic things in their vehicles when I test drove them which bothered me a lot. I've seen two or three reviews over the last few years slapping them a little bit on the amount of plastic as well. Though the leather was really nice quality and comfortable I'll give MB that! "
"fedlawman","October 2010"," Plekto is right.The IS300 is a good example of a fine effort by Lexus to build a BMW. For the most part, they did a good job - in-line 6, 5 speed MT, fun to drive, and sporty inside. At the same time, they missed a few little things that held the car back from becoming a hit with enthusiasts - the interior was cheap and gimmicky (chronograph instruments), it wasn't as quick as a comparable BMW 330i, and it was nose heavy.Of course, the biggest problem with the IS300 was sales. It didn't appeal to Lexus shoppers. It wasn't quiet, luxurious, or elegant so it didn't sell well.A couple other opinions:GM makes the Cadillac CTS, which by all accounts is a fine car in this class. It compares well to any car in this category, and does well because it doesn't try to be all things to all people. It is what it is, and it's proud of that.Infinity is the closest Japan gets to building a BMW in this class, but it lacks many of the things that BMW buyers want - a smooth and refined driveline being at the top of the list. I also think it's wheelbase is too long and it's too heavy.Kind of off-topic, but the best recent examples of Japanese sports cars are the dearly departed Honda S2000 and the Mazda Miata and RX-8. These cars are/were fantastic because they aren't trying to beat BMW or be a ""Japanese BMW contender."" They are great simply because they were built from the ground up to be great cars. Period. "
"jimbres","October 2010","  These cars are/were fantastic because they aren't trying to beat BMW or be a ""Japanese BMW contender."" They are great simply because they were built from the ground up to be great cars. Period.Excellent point - very insightful post. I had never thought of the Miata & the RX-8 that way, but I see now that you're right.A used Miata can be a terrific value. A friend bought an 8-year-old Miata for less than $3K some years ago & is having an indecent amount of fun with it. It's not fast, but the handling is superb & the gearbox is almost as much fun as you-know-what. "
"nyccarguy","October 2010"," was also built to compete with the E36 BMWs or maybe the early E46 328i. The I6 was a smooth mill, but it wasn't that powerful (215 hp) and didn't get very good gas mileage for such a small car.It handled very well and was handsome once they tinted the taillights. The wheels were sharp & filled the wells quite nicely.It was ultimately too sharp, edgy, & rough for the traditional Lexus buyer. It didn't perform well enough to Wow the BMW crowd.There were actually a bunch of us BMW lovers back in late '05 that were eagerly awaiting the arrival of the '06 IS because we thought Lexus was so close with the 1st gen IS that it would hit a home run with IS version 2.0I happen to like the styling of the current IS. The IS 350 gets out if it's own way, but the brakes are instant on and cannot be modulated. Performance-wise, the IS250 doesn't compete at all with a 328i. For the price of an IS350, I'll spend a few $$$ more and get a very nice N55 powered 335i which is available with 6-speed manual transmission. "
"plekto","October 2010"," Like I said, they somehow missed that sweet spot. The G25, though, appears to be the magic combination, though. Especially with the Journey package and wood trim. I think at 30K, it's going to be a huge wake-up shot across everyone's bow. My only hope is that Infiniti figures out that it's the right thing and not mess with it until it's broken. "
"nyccarguy","October 2010"," No sport suspension, no stick shift, no nyccarguy. "
"plekto","October 2010"," Sport suspension isn't really required, and I don't like super-harsh rides, but the omission of manual... Oh lord, they've just fallen on their face. So close and yet, someone in the board room is just a daft idiot. Because in Japan and Europe, you'll be able to get the manual version.Seriously, what part of ""put your best foot forward"" isn't reaching these guys? It's like GM's Regal. Get rid of the base model corporate nonsense. Get rid of the base trim, the puny base engine, and only offer your best example FIRST. Then offer a cheaper alternative in a year or so. You have to strike hard when the product is new and fresh. If all you hear(as GM did) is ""awesome, but the engine is pathetic"", by the time you get to doing it right, everyone will have passed on for better choices. "
"smarty666","October 2010"," was was a bigger disappointment for me on the G25 is the lack of navigation and the fuel economy. How the heck does a G25x, with an over 100hp reduction, have the same fuel economy as a RWD G37 :confuse: :confuse: "
"ivan_99","October 2010"," The non AWD shows 20/29...which is better than the 17/25 for the G37.Better question is how does the V6 mustang get 30 highway with almost +100 hp...if only Ford had something a little more refined on par with this class. "
"edwardsf","October 2010"," Wow, that is a lot of: ""get over it"" and ""you don't get it"" and ""give me a break"" in one post. Why would I ever want links, cites or stats? Ivan99 and a couple of other posters have some interesting comments about prestige as a factor and some are convincing. But I still think most people buy the car they like to drive. Or as you would say, ""it is a FACT people buy the car they like to drive.""BTW, I would take a nose heavy TL over a MB anyday. MBs are very good looking but of course are very expensive, super costly to repair and are not nearly as fun to drive as Bimmers, Audis or Infinities. But I guess - given your theme song - that people drive them because they think they are ""prestigious?"" "
"ivan_99","October 2010"," ""it is a FACT people buy the car they like to drive."" I'm not certain it is a fact.WE -- buy cars we like to drive (of course speaking for you here  ).A large number of people in my corporate office buy cars that have a good resale, have good reliability, look nice, have a good reputationThe way they drive (which I'm assuming means a well handling vehicle) is further down the list somewhere.Of course I suppose if the vehicle meets the requirements above (resale, reliability etc)...they'd ""Like to drive it""  "
"edwardsf","October 2010"," I loved the IS300 and they had a wagon. This was another Euroconcept that the IS300 had that Japanese cars normally eschew. And I love wagons and long hatches. The 1st gen G20 was also a tossable little sport sedan - something like the 1993-5 era Audi 4000. None of these three were rocket ships but then I don't buy cars for that. I will take tossabilty and usable torque over raw stoplight takeoff power. But that is just me. "
"edwardsf","October 2010"," Um,yeah. That was the point - my statement was an opinion and calling opinions ""facts"" is dumb. Reread my post. I wrote, ""or as you would say...""On the point that you know people who do buy for resale, I thought that was just Acura drivers.  Seriously, I would buy a minivan for that but not a sport sedan and that is what I was referring to. "
"smarty666","October 2010"," Thats not what I'm talking about. Up here in the Northeast, I would never buy just RWD vehicles b/c of the snow factor in the winter so its either FWD or AWD. So I'm left with the AWD option on a G if I were to get one. The fuel economy should be better than this with such a smaller engine in the vehicle and its size. I was hoping for 21/30mpg minimum but didn't even get that. To me, the way Infiniti has it, there is no big advantage of getting the G25 over the G37. Mise well get the bigger oomph G37. AWD G25 is rated 19/27mpg RWD G37 is rated 19/27mpg AWD G37 is rated 18/25mpg I'm left :confuse: "
"smarty666","October 2010"," We actually agree on somethings :surprise: :surprise:. I agree that many people buy the car they like to drive and one of the reasons some like to drive it, is b/c of the badge it has on the front end  . You be hard press to find BMW or MB drivers who would still think they would like to drive a vehicle with say a Chevy or Toyota emblem on them simply b/c they liked the way they drove. Reason why I would not consider MB the next go around is for personal reasons. Their vehicles are very luxurious/nice looking but both the C and E class have gotten way to close to the ground for my taste and I have a really bad back and would break my butt getting in and out of them all the time. Plus, as you pointed out, they are not as fun to drive as Audi's, Infinities, or Bimmers which is a factor for me when driving! Luckily, BMW and Audi have not followed MBs direction of low ground clearance on their sedans and those 3 makes will most likely be the brands I cross shop next time around, maybe Lexus if they can improve upon the IS enough for my liking.

"sweendogy","October 2010"," i agree the G25 is not a great deal in awd form vs the g37. MpG on this car stinks, i have a g35x. i really hope the g25 owners get more mpgs because the 3k difference in price FOR me is not worth the lack of quickness. I just went on infinitis website and the new g25 is now listed.. no manual stinks...no navi in the cheepo 25 and the price of the sport(g37) now starts with all the options (i would get them all, yes) and its a tad under 40k-- right now i am not a fan.. Infinti where is the manual AWD car we are looking for. "
"smarty666","October 2010"," It is my hope that the lack of manual, nav, and a few other things on the G25 was done intentionally by Infiniti b/c they really are just using the 25 right now to test the entry-lux level for it and see how it does. All those features it lacks would jack the price up on the G25 further making it compete in the G37 territory of price which would be just plain ridiculous. Remember, this generation G is coming to an end hopefully at the end of next year since 2011 is the fifth model year now, and it will be due for a redesign across the board for 2012.It's my hope that if the G25 sells okay for Infiniti that when they go to redo the 3G G-Sedan they will completely redo/rethink the G25 and add these features and maybe even make a totally different body style for it from the high trim G sedan. This is just speculation of course though. "

"sweendogy","October 2010"," i think from that article you posted that infiniti didnt change the body for a reason.. and that reason is to take on the bmw328-- keeping pricing as its biggest advantage and not losing the ""g"" spirit. I think its a calculated move but misses the target without the manual option. as for the g coming to an end in 2012--is that the case?? why would they offer this car for just one year before an overhaul... dont know why you said ""hopefully"" - this is the car that saved infiniti from being boring. "
"nyccarguy","October 2010"," for different folks.Every single one of these cars has pluses and minuses to different people. For the longest time I've actually favored handling and driving dynamics over raw power and torque.Maybe I'm getting older & the fact that I live in CT where the entrance ramps on The Merrit Parkway are short and have STOP signs at the beginning of them has something to do with it. My 2001 Honda Prelude Type SH handles brilliantly. However, its 200 horsepower @ 7000 RPM (7500 RPM redline), 156 lb/ft of torque @ 5250 RPM, & almost 128,000 miles just doesn't quite cut the mustard anymore. Even my wife's 4cyl TSX feels like it has more pickup. I'm not in the market now because I just bought a house and a second car payment is out of the question right now. Plus I think we're going to try and ditch the TSX next year to get wifey an SUV of some sort (she misses her '07 X3).So if she gets an SUV, then my next ride doesn't have to be huge. Just as long as it has LATCHes for the car seats so I can take my boys somewhere without stranding wifey without a car (she can drive stick, but hasn't in years). In my new home,I'll be putting over 21,000 miles per year on a car just commuting.I believe with the modern electronic nannies (traction control, stability control, ABS), I can rock a RWD sport sedan through our winters with a dedicated set of snow tires (as I do with my Prelude).The G37S is priced right, has gobs of power, and I'm really impressed with how it handles. I've only driven an AWD G37X, so I can only imagine how well the S handles.BMWs are not cheap to buy. 3 series are everywhere you turn. I love the way the E90 3 series drives, rides, handles, brakes. I've only owned new cars in my life since I passed my driving test at 16 (I'm only 34 now), but I will totally consider a CPO N55 powered 335i in the future.Like I said before, the Lexus IS350 appeals to me. I like the styling, the interior is very well finished I'm sure, They now offer an F Sport version of the IS which I'm sure sharpens the handling. I went to Lexus and built one, it isn't as expensive as I once thought. But no stick shift available on the IS350 kills me. I know there is a stick offered on the IS250, but that car has the pickup of a Corolla. At least the slushbox AWD version I drove did. The brakes are impossible to modulate. There is NO way the steering is as sharp as the 3 series. I keep my cars for a while. Going on 9 years with my '01 Prelude (bought new as a leftover in April '02). We'll see what happens when the time comes. "

"shipo","October 2010"," You beat me to it. Funny thing; I live in a rather hilly part of (often) snowy New Hampshire and I have yet to understand why so many folks ""need"" AWD. I mean geez, unless you have a driveway like my 'cross the street neighbor (a driveway that rises more than 100' over a distance of about 250'), I feel that the extra weight of an AWD system can actually lead to a less safe vehicle when it's slippery out there. ""Less safe?"" Some might question. Yes, less safe. Why? Because the extra weight will, if anything, lengthen stopping distances and reduce the already diminished capacity for a quick maneuver.FWIW #1, when we moved up here I had a 530i SP, and after the first quarter inch snow fall I promptly ordered a set of winter wheels and tires; they in turn transformed my 5er from a car that couldn't make it up my driveway (only a 9% grade), to a car that could easily reel in AWD and 4WD vehicles in rutted snow up to about 7"" deep (beyond that my car would turn into a snow plow, causing me to simply stay home or leave it at home in favor of a set of cross-country skis).FWIW #2, the neighbor I referred to above has a winter tire shod Audi A6 Quattro, and as often as not, when the snow flies I see his car either parked down by the street, or stuck kinda sideways some distance up above the road. Said another way, even AWD isn't all it's cracked up to be on really steep slopes. "
"Kirstie_H","October 2010"," It isn't *just* AWD on these vehicles. I'm certainly not an expert, but for whatever reason, I haven't had good luck with MPG results on Infinitis. Right now, I'm looking at putting an average of under 10K miles per year on my car, so it's not a big deal. But when I was driving 22K/year, low MPG on my G35 (RWD) was disappointing. "
"ivan_99","October 2010"," What kind of mileage do you get? I had an 03 G35 and would see about 21mpg or so. This was mostly highway (70-80%).At the time I thought it was fine...but TODAY... with Sonata's putting out more power than my G did back then (especially with the old hp rating system) and getting in the 30's mpg...my expectations have increased. "
"smarty666","October 2010"," no, I didn't say they were ending the G they will be due for a redesign on the G model since 2011 is the 5th model year of the 2G. I wouldn't get so hung up on the lack of manual at this point. Like the article says, there is no demand for the manual and Infiniti even has trouble selling them in the G37 so most are not going to want the manual in a G25 and they might have some cost issues with at least offering. The TSX does not offer a manual and you don't see its sales tanking. Yes the option is nice to have but Infiniti might have the lack of it as an excuse to force people to get the more expensive G37 as a sales ploy so you never know. Maybe in the future they will make it an order only option.The 3G G models are just around the corner and I'm eagerly anticipating what Infiniti is going to do to their best selling vehicle. I'm interested to see what influence MB is going to have on the next gen G engine since Nissan/Infiniti is now in a co-op partnership with Diamler and they are suppose to be sharing things between divisions! "
"smarty666","October 2010"," Well I can't speak for when, how, and what kind of vehicle you have, but I know from multiple bad winter storms here in NJ over the years, that with my FX, I was all over the road with just the RWD. I tried driving numerous times without the AWD and II was scared for my life. Even doing 10-20mph below speed limit and being extremely careful the wheels would spin out. Once I engaged AWD the vehicle felt planted to the road and I stopped spinning out and having difficulties controlling the vehicle. Everything I read to this day still says AWD is the preferable option for winter weather traveling and I concur with my own personal experience.To me, there is usally only a 1-2 mpg difference between AWD and RWD so mise well not take the chance and sacrifice a little mpg. Personally, I like that Infiniti has AWD option and not AWD all the time like Subaru and others. This way, 85% of the year I can use just the RWD with better fuel economy and just use AWD when I need it specifically. If there is ice on the road forget AWD or any drive for that matter. When there is ice on the ground nothing can help you. "
"jimbres","October 2010"," Shipo's point is that with the right tires - dedicated winter tires - one can safely drive an RWD car on snow-covered roads. Did you switch to dedicated winter tires, or were you using all-season tires when you tried to drive in RWD mode in snowy conditions?If the latter, then you really weren't addressing Shipo's point.

"smarty666","October 2010"," I didn't realize he was referring to winter tires so that is my bad. If that is what he was making then maybe with really excellent quality winter tires you could get away with just RWD. You are right, I had all season tires on the vehicle since I don't have the extra money lying around to go buy a second set of tires just for winter driving. I can't see spending several hundred dollars for tires you only would use on occasion 2-3 months out of the year. Just my personal preference. "

"sweendogy","October 2010"," tsx does come in manual--and has since they started making the car..and has pretty sweet throws. On TSX sales not tanking, i would like to see the numbers. The reason infinti offers a manual is to compete with the BMW 3 but- i guess research shows that the lower 328 sells most cars as autos which for me is a shame. I need a g37x 6 speed. and on the diamler partnership I agree I hope they keep the nissan 3.7 (or do they go to 4.0) - it might be loud and offers less mpgs but its a pure beast "
"shipo","October 2010"," You can't afford a set of winter tires but you can afford to buy AWD? Uhhh, what did I miss?FWIW, the winter tires paid for themselves, and then some. Consider the following: - I had the 530i for three winters before I turned it in at lease end. - The winter wheel/tire set cost me $1,005. - At lease end my factory tires all had at least 1mm more tread depth than BMW Finance's minimum, and as such I didn't need to buy a new set of summer performance tires; cost (then): ~$900 installed. - After the 5er was gone I sold the winter wheel/tire set for $500.Long story short, not only did I not pay a fifteen hundred to twenty-five hundred dollar up charge for AWD, I made $395 by spending the $1,005 on the winter wheel/tire set. Kinda like found money. "
"edwardsf","October 2010"," Hmm, what is this ""agree"" thingy? Well, okay, I will run with it. Regarding ground clearance, I have the same issue with getting in and out. My A4 avec sport package was lower to the ground than my 3 series (sans sport package) and the Audi's seats were just a smidgen lower. This meant I used my back much more getting out of the Audi than I do now with the Bimmer. So make sure you try them all in various packages. BTW, the Bimmer non sport seemed to be similar in cornering to the A4 sport. Of course, the Quattro sticks better due to AWD but the Bimmer's steering is just sublime. I truly think the Audi is the balance between the Bimmer and the Mercedes. I also felt that the Infiinty drove heavier than all three German cars. The G almost reminded me of an American muscle car. NB, I only drove used (2007-8) models. But since cars don't seem to get lighter, I think the Germans are probably more nimble feeling than the Infinity. Regarding my other infirmity, I have a hearing loss and carefully scrutinized for road noise. The Germans win again, especially the C300 and the 3 series. The new A4 was definitely my favorite car but it really was had much more road noise than the the others. Also, the Lexus were pretty quiet. That said, I like almost all these cars on the list on the right. The only exceptions are the Caddy, which just seems gauche and the cramped, slow IS250. They all have their strengths and cars are really just better now. "

"jimbres","October 2010","  I can't see spending several hundred dollars for tires you only would use on occasion 2-3 months out of the year. Just my personal preference. My guess is that you're a young guy. All-season radial tires didn't become widely available until the mid to late 1970s. Before that, just about everyone who lived in the snow belt switched tires - from regular to snows, as they were called then - at the beginning of winter & then switched back to regular tires at the beginning of spring. Keep in mind that almost everyone drove RWD cars in those days. FWD didn't become widely available until the 70s, & AWD was available only on trucks until the 90s.I remember that Dad always made the switch to snow tires on the Friday after Thanksgiving.Something else to remember is that your regular tires will last that much longer if you're running with winter tires during the cold weather months. So the total ownership cost is less than you think.Given that tires are the only part of your car that actually touches the road, do you really want to cheap out on them? Think about it. If you can't afford top quality rubber for your car, you might be better off riding the bus. "
"smarty666","October 2010"," sure! winter tires are not exactly known for smooth ride and low noise level so why would I want to deal with that from Dec-Mar! I'll take the smoother/more quiet ride all season tires offer "
"smarty666","October 2010"," Research by many companies has shown that the 6spd does not sell well on many cars. That is the reason Nissan stopped offering it on the Maxima. There was not enough demand for it and they were losing money no the manual models. You can get a manual on the G37 just like on the TL now so you have options if you want manual they are just much more limited then if you wanted automatic. I said TSX sales have been pretty good so I don't know why you want numbers on why its tanking :confuse: I want them to keep the VQ engines as well b/c I agree they are a performance beast, it is m hope Diamler and Mercedes will be able to just help Nissan quiet them down a bit at idle, etc so they are more refined sounding. "
"smarty666","October 2010"," Well, despite not getting winter tires, I have always tried to get some of the best all season tires for road grip, handling, etc to compensate and most have done pretty well. Its not that big of a deal for me b/c I will not drive on the road with more than a few inches of snow. Its just nice to have the AWD so that I don't get stuck at work or anywhere if I'm not home when a winter storm or blizzard starts. "
"shipo","October 2010"," ""sure! winter tires are not exactly known for smooth ride and low noise level so why would I want to deal with that from Dec-Mar!

I've driven cars with a dozen different winter tires over the last few years, and to a one, the tires were easily as quiet as the rubber used on the car for the other three seasons; that and in most cases they rode smoother! ""Smoother?"" you ask. Yes, smoother. Why? Because typically when one buys a winter wheel/tire set, they ""minus one"" on the size (my 530i is a good example; the summer tires were 235/45 R17s while the winter tires were 225/55 R16s), and the taller sidewall of the winter tires afforded a cushier ride.

"nyccarguy","October 2010"," Bingo! Right on the money as usual Shipo. My winter wheels & tires are minus one on my Prelude (Summer size 205/50 R16, winter size 195/60 R15). In 8 & a half years, I've never been stuck in my Prelude once. That includes getting buried overnight while parked on the street in a snowstorm by the NYC Department of Sanitation, living in Westchester County (NYC suburb) that is anything but flat. Not once being able to NOT make it to work (not an option, my Dad is the boss & my name's on the door) due to inclement weather.

"smarty666","October 2010"," I don't know why you guys are making a big deal about this winter tire BS! Did you ever think maybe some people have special situations that would preclude them from doing so? Not only do I not want to spend the money on a second set a tires I only use a few months out of the year, I've had 3 back surgeries and major back problems and would break my a#$ trying to lug tires in and out of car to go have them put on the car twice a year and lug them down stairs for storage the rest of the year. I spent enough money on tires and back surgeries that I don't need to go and screw up my back just to get winter tires put on my car.Its much easier just to get AWD and it works fine for me and a lot of other people so live with it. Plus, I can't speak for other northern area of the country but I know that all the Infiniti dealers and BMW dealers around where I live only have AWD versions on their lots. The only way you can get RWD only is by special ordering one. Once in a while you might get lucky and see a RWD only on the lot but usually the service departments snatch them up as service loaners. "
"jimbres","October 2010"," Steady there, big guy. We're just trying to educate you. No need to get excited. "
"shipo","October 2010"," ""The only way you can get RWD only is by special ordering one.""So? Since I prefer to do European Delivery (and save thousands of dollars in the process), I have to order anyway. Thinking about this further, since, ummm, 1979 we've ordered 8 of our 13 cars (including both of our RWD BMWs, one ED, one not). "
"mz6greyghost","October 2010"," Being from Upstate NY, I can mostly agree with the amount of AWD models on the local lots, but there are still RWD models available, without having to special-order them (and they're NOT only base models with no options either).As far as winter tires are concerned, granted each area has a different climate, but when you live in an area that averages over 150"" of snow per year, and when it can fall at rates of 4-6"" PER HOUR, winter tires are a must. I lose count of how many different AWD vehicles (SUVs, cars, etc.) that end up being buried in a roadside ditch simply because their all-seasons can't keep up with the conditions. People tend to forget that AWD only helps with acceleration, but does nothing in terms of steering or stopping on slippery roads. Given a choice, I'd take a vehicle with winter tires over any AWD vehicle with all-season tires, no matter which set of wheels are actually attached to the drivetrain.And IIRC, there are some local dealers that actually store the winter tires/wheels for you when they're not needed, and will swap out the 3-season wheels/tires and store them in the winter months (for a fee, of course!)

"sweendogy","October 2010"," i agree lawman.. but smarty is again mistaken as you posted, just like he was mistaken about me even talking about the TSX -- i have never made comments saying the tsx sales have tanked but I did say and prove (using hondas own sales numbers) that TL sales have ""tanked"" since they changed to the modern design -- i can pull up the numbers again for the TL --the car i mentioned. Smarty might be having flashbacks on the TL2009+ chat when i threw a bunch of slaes facts about the TL. But for smarty to say the TSX sales not tanking-well again I would like to see the numbers -- wait i went to wiki and here are the facts-Total American sales2003[28] 18,9322004 30,3652005[29] 34,8562006 38,0352007[30] 33,0372008[30] 31,9982009 28,6502009 was when they changed the body style-- I dont think this is a tank job-ALA TL -- so smarty I agree..but acura in general cant be happy with the present momentum of sales. that was easy (sorry for the long post) "
"smarty666","October 2010"," Again, you put words in their that I did not say. I did not say that TSX sales were strong or really really good.

For the last time, I DID NOT say TSX sales tanked, I said TSX sales HAD NOT TANKED! :mad: Just because they have decreased over the last two years by a few thousand does not mean they are tanking and as I just showed you in a post above, the TSX is higher in sales this year thus far then at this time last year hence a upward rise. Yeah, your figures really showed how bad the TSX sales have tanked :blush: And here is the figures for the TL to show its decrease in sales and thus poor sales performance, taken from Acura media newsroom.YTD 2010 25,031YTD 2009 25,882YTD - 1.8% TL 2004 Sales: 77,895TL 2005 Sales: 78,218TL 2006 Sales: 72,348TL 2007 Sales: 58,545TL 2008 Sales: 48,766TL 2009 Sales: 33,620 As you can see, the sales decrease in the TL is quite substantial compared to the TSX and hence why I have said tanked for the TL. It is sad considering the TL was Acura's bread and butter model for so many years and that now has changed to the MDX. You can state a whole host of reasons why it dropped but its safe to say that the TSX has been a better success for them then the TL is right now. "

I just drove a 2011 G37S (auto - wife ruled out the manual.... :blush: ) but it seems a bit small - I'll have to drive it again. I enjoyed the power and handling. Any thoughts out there? Any other cars to consider? I'm not a fan of the American offerings and while I love the drive of the 335i I don't like the price tag with all the options I'd want... :confuse: I've been on this board for several years now so I know someone might offer some thought I hadn't considered... "
"plekto","October 2010"," Does it have to be new? I have several that I'd recommend if you are willing to consider something a couple of years old, like a 2008 CTS. 20K, give or take, and just about perfect for your needs.I guarantee that it's not ""American"" in how it's designed or drives. Probably the only thing that GM has for sale now, in fact, that is like that. My second recommendation is actually also from GM, but you'd have to get a 2009 model, because GM stopped importing it to the U.S. then. Go test drive a Pontiac G8/Holden Commodore. It's a fantastic vehicle and is no problem to find one for less than 20K, certified. If you want something that handles well, is RWD, has a nice interior, and is a total sleeper/under everyone's radar, while being one size larger than a G37 - without the silly price tag, look no further.I personally like it more than the current CTS. I'm still incredibly shocked that GM took it's #1 selling passenger car in Australia(and best IMO, that they currently make worldwide) and stopped importing it to the U.S. Such an incredibly idiotic move. But you can get one used. Change the badges if you wish.  Note - it's also sold outside the U.S. as the new Chevy Lumina.  So at least there's some hope of it returning next year or so.These two are the only options from GM that will satisfy you if you like how the TL and Infiniti and so on drive. Everything else, yes, it's a toad and should be avoided. But do check these out - you might be able to get a used/certified car and own it for only a little more than the payments on a lease of something like a 3 series. "

"ivan_99","October 2010"," I'm assuming your requirements are similar to your 08 TL i.e. you're ok with FWD...don't need super sport suspension tunning.You want space...more than an IS...something around a 5 series (if the price was right).You could almost list all manufacturers and they'd each have an offering in this segment.You mentioned that you're apprehensive about Audi reliability. Since you lease are you concerned about being stranded and/or inconvenienced with repairs? I'd take a look at the domestics as well (I actually liked the CTS...coupe looks very nice too)...go drive a CTS, LaCrosse, SHO...even go drive an MKS and see...of course if you 'know' you're not going to buy one then I suppose you're just waisting your time (I was surprised).If you're not keen on domestics how about the European? C350 is very nice, S60 looks nice (never drove)...might be small if a 5 series is your size requirement.At this point, for me, I'd lean more towards a new A4 2.0T...does everything well, looks real elegant and has good mileage.I liked the new TL as well (I also like the looks  ) ...it wasn't too large and the SH-AWD let me over-steer the back end out a bit...so that was pleasant. Plus you'd get your space requirements (guess Maxima has similar specs too).New Infiniti M37?You may also lean towards the vehicles with the 'included maintenance' as well... "
"igozoomzoom","October 2010"," It's painful for me to admit, but the beak on the current TL is the most hideous thing I've ever seen! This is coming from someone who still can remember my first time driving my cousin's brand new 1986 Acura Legend (dark blue with gray lower accent) and realizing that it was the most special car I'd ever driven. I later owned a 1994 Acura Legend GS that was the love of my life until it was demolished by a drunk jerk driving a huge 4x4- but it saved my life. I also owned a 2002 TL Type-S that was a spectacular car in every way...until the transmission went out at 32k miles and then again after another 20k miles...I didn't want to own it if/when the third transmission failed if it was out of warranty, so I had to get rid of it. Suffice it to say, I've been an Acura-phile from the very beginning in late 1985...but the newest designs range from bland to downright vulgar (TL)....the TSX seems to suffer the least from this design 'theme'?Have you considered the TSX V6 as a possible replacement for your '08 TL-S? It is less than an one-inch +/- in front and rear head, leg and hip room compared to your TL. Overall passenger volume is 94 cu ft vs. 98 cu ft for your TL, so it's only very slightly smaller. Interior cargo (luggage) volume is virtually identical at 12.6 vs. 12.5 cu ft. The Infiniti G37S is almost identical in every interior measurement (head/leg/hip room) to your TL, with 99 cu ft of passenger volume and 13.5 cu ft cargo volume. So it's not smaller in any way than the TL, but the interior design or other design aspects may may it 'seem' to be...I'd give it another look before ruling it out! If you are leasing, would the larger Infiniti M37 also be within the realm of possibilities? It has a boost in headroom and legroom in front and rear compared to the TL. Total passener volume is 104 cubic feet and cargo volume is 14.9 cu ft. Not sure if I like it any better than the G37S, but it might be something to consider....And one other wild card that I will recommend, if a luxury 'brand' isn't esssential and you're just wanting a car that looks and performs in the same realm with most entry-level performance/luxury models- the 2011 Mazda6 s Grand Touring 4-door. The current 2010 is a very impressive vehicle, with exceptional handling and plenty of power any time you need it! The 3.7L V6 only has a 272hp rating, but it has 269lb-ft of torque (matching the torque figures for the 330hp M37 and exceeding all the other cars discussed above, despite their 280-328hp ratings). It also hits that torque peak at 4250rpm, compared to 5200rpm in both Infinitis.The only two options on the 2010 MZ6 s Grand Touring are Voice-Activated Navigation and the Technology Package. The Tech Package adds Advanced Keyeless Entry & Start with push-button starting, SIRIUS sat radio, LED tail lights, Fully automatic Bi-Xenon HID headlamps, power passenger seat and rain-sensing wipers. With those two options, it is a very close match for the G37S, feature-for-feature but for $6-7k less! The 2011 model is getting a 'refresh' that willl only make the car more attractive and upscale in look and feel. It's worth a visit to the Mazda dealer one day, just to experience the car for yourself. My best friend and I took one for a test drive two weekends ago and he wasn't even in the market for a new car....but he traded his 2008 IS 250 on the spot for it! =) "
"smarty666","October 2010"," I can definitely feel you about the new TL. I have a 08 as well and the new one is such a turn off on the exterior for me its not even funny. If you think the G37 is small then I would not recommend a 3 Series or C-Class since they are even smaller on the inside. I would recommend a Caddy CTS or like other's have mentioned the new Maxima. If your looking for the true sport sedan feel you won't get that completely with the Max due to the CVT/FWD but it definitely has got a more sport oriented handling and power. I ended up with one b/c like you did not want a G37 due to the cramped feeling when in it. The Max has plenty of room, pretty sporty body style, and you get certain features you normally can only get in luxury sedans if you get the premium packages. The leasing and financing for it are excellent and many people are getting fully loaded ones for $34-35k. If that doesn't fit your bill, I would check out the Genesis but again, some people don't like the Hyundai name plate. Not sure what budget or finances are for your but if possible, I would check out the new M and 5 Series as well. They are definitely going to fit your bill when it comes to size and features but you will pay more for them obviously. Best of Luck!!! "
"dap2006","October 2010"," Great post! Gave me some things to think about. I haven't been an Acura fan as long as you but I had a 92 Accord that I loved and kept 12 years - I got a 2006 TL after that and then my current TL-S. I had driven the 335i before I got the TL-S and loved the drive - almost pulled the trigger but my wife had loved the Honda/Acura's (2 previous Civic's) so I caved and I went with my current ride (which is nice, don't get me wrong).I'm not a Mazda fan but I'll take a look at the MZ6 to see what it looks like. I can't see me driving a Benz, though - too much coin for what you get. So far I'm thinking the Audi A4/S4, G37S and M37 seem the likely suspects... :shades: :shades: "
"ivan_99","October 2010"," I loved the Mazda6 V6 as well...in the manual-auto mode I had it in 1st gear at around 4k rpm -- just going down the street. I hammered it and chirped the tires into 2nd gear.Not really a marketable feature...or even worthy of purchasing it for (since it is very good overall). But a very powerful V6. Rear seat room is HUGE too.LOVED the manual in the Mazda 6...too bad it only was on the 4cylNot much love for the Mazda 6...don't see many.Same as the VW CC -- don't see many. I actually prefer the CC over many in this thread. "
"plekto","October 2010"," I will mention, though, that the new CTS is worlds better than anything Mazda makes. It's positioned in Europe as a BMW 5 series competitor at a lot less money. My parents just went through this exact same scenario. And had it down to the same models are you are looking at. And the CTS just simply was a superior product to the Infiniti. The only vehicle that gave it serious competition was the C300, which is my #1 pick if money is no object. It;s everything that you want and Mercedes is apparently finally making their cars right again. Though currently only the C class is benefiting, as will the upcoming model E class(it takes time to re-tool and phase in new technology)Also, I mentioned the G8 because while 2009 was the last year for it, it had the same suspension and engine as a CTS. It's a worlds better choice than the LaCrosse and actually is fairly attractive by comparison(looks like a cross between the CTS and the LaCrosse, IMO - slightly rounded but not a jellybean.But let's look at the math on slightly used vs lease:First off, Infiniti has no financing options currently on 2011 models. (it's impossible to find a 2010 to lease at this point). Fail.Let's look at Acura, then. Oops. Same deal.K... Mercedes. Mercedes always runs leases(as does VW and Audi) C300 $349/month for 27 months. 10K/yr. $3141at signing.Total at lease end: 12215 in payments. $452.41/month.(a BMW 328i is $439/month with 0 down at signing for reference)Let's have some fun, then. 2011 Accord EX. $229 /month for 36 months. $1499 at signing. Total at lease end: 9743 in payments.  $270.64/month.Now why would I do this comparison? Because to lease any vehicle, you have to factor in what it costs versus a used model that still has the same amount of factory warranty left. 36 months lease vs 36 months(or more) warranty. Now, the main deal here is the drive train, which is pretty much all that matters(most certified cars get an extension anyways and the gremlins have been worked out/fixed. It's basically a wash, IMO, since a 2 year old car won't break anyways unless it's something nasty like a Suzuki or Daewoo. I did a 2 minute search for a 2009 G8 with low mileage and under $25K.http://www.autotrader.com/fyc/vdp.jsp?ct=c&car_id=279792030Figure $22K now and $12K in three years. That's $10K for three years. I put the Accord in as a comparison because what this means is that you can get a certified year old vehicle and run it for three years for the same price as an economy car lease.But there's no wear and tear adjustment, no money factor idiocy or other tricks, no mileage cap or penalty. In short, you can OWN and decide to keep to trade whenever you want for the same price as a lease. The only difference is the payment structure per month. But a 72 month payment plan will usually net (now due to silly low interest rates) about the same monthly payment as a lease. If you want out of it, or to buy it at the end of the ""payments"", it's a clear win. Keep paying the bank or just sell it and end up with 0 month owed after 36 months.I get about $350 a month in this scenario vs $450 a month for the Mercedes or BMW. Note - you can get a 2008 CTS for about ~25K and the money works out the same as the CTS depreciates a bit less - ~15K at 6 years old. The only difference is $400 a month and the same $10K total cost.Let some other person eat the 10-15K initial depreciation. Never buy new. "
"alltorque","October 2010"," I will mention, though, that the new CTS is worlds better than anything Mazda makes. It's positioned in Europe as a BMW 5 series competitor at a lot less money. Here in UK, the BMW 5's run from ?31k for the 523i SE to around ?50k for the 550i SE, with lots of diesels. The Cadillac CTS runs from ?27k for the 2.8 V6 thro' ?30k for the 3.6 V6 to ?56k for the 6.2 V8, (though who would buy that beats me). CTS is generally compared unfavourably to BMW/Merc/Jag/Audi due to poor ride/handling, (our roads aren't great), and having no diesel options..............a very big points loser !Not sure I've ever seen one on the road.The Mazda 6 runs from ?16k for the 1.8 S through to ?23k for the 2.2D Sport Estate, (wagon).

"dap2006","October 2010"," I drove the Audi A4 Premium Plus w/ sport package today - I was looking for a Quattro but they had just arrived and weren't prepped yet. Great interior, solid, high quality all around - liked the nav, seats, LED's etc.. much to like here. Only problem - turbo lag. The salesman assured me the car would learn how I drive and adjust within 500 miles, also that the Quattro had half the lag - I'll go back and see. Other than that, very pleasing...Anyone else have any experience with the A4 turbo? Does the lag improve? "
"tlong","October 2010"," Personally I don't see how 4wd or ""learning how you drive"" would get rid of turbo lag. Might be a BS salesman wanting a sale or lease. But what do I know? "

Doubly so if there isn't a diesel option. And, the new CTS doesn't have a tiny engine option, either - you get big and guzzling or you go home But here in the U.S., yes, it's cheaper than a 5 series by a fair amount especially at the end of the model year, is a bit more reliable, and drives essentially the same. Of course it's now a 3 series competitor, but few things are. "
"v8nuts","October 2010"," well I decided to get the 335i last year and am glad I did it is worth every penny .

Still sad that they took such a nice looking vehicle out of their lineup.

"edwardsf","November 2010"," Re: the acceleration, I think it is called salesman ignorance, not BSRegarding the turbolag in the A4, I think it is not the AWD but is the lousy CVT Audi puts in the FWD A4. The CVT improves gas mileage but acceleration suffers. (I liked the CVT in the Maxima.) I test drove several 2010 A4s with and without the CVT and there is a huge difference between the CVT and the tiptronic in the Quattro - the tip it is much smoother and seems faster. I had a 2007 Quattro A4, which had a little more turbo lag - the 2010 is much smoother and almost eliminates turbo lag. That said, turbo lag ain't all bad because it means you get turbo acceleration. As fun and fast as my 328iT is, it does not give the whoosh that the torque in the A4 gives in 40-60 mph. I am an odd creature in that I love Audis (and Swedish Saabs) but don't own one. I own a bimmer because it is quieter and I have a hearing problem. Both are vunderval! cars. The A4 is prettier, with more luxurious leather and a smoother, more refined driving feel. The 328 handles better, is faster throughout the mph range and is more reliable. The 335, of course, is faster but much more expensive and has a lousy repair record. Regarding size, the 328i (sedan) is a bit cramped but the iT (sportwagon) has about the same amount of interior space as the A4 sedan and wagon. Or, how about a used 528 or 535? If you get a 2009, you get 4 years of warranty - 2 years of original warranty and two years of CPO. You eliminate those first two years of huge depreciation if you bargain well. Cars.com has a 2009 in L.A. with 13k for $36,000. You could get it for $31,000. Other thoughts - try the new Volvo S60. It looks very cool and is very fast. New Jags are gorgeous. Dap, You are right: The G37 IS cramped. The C300 IS cramped. The IS250 IS like a 70s band - supercramped. The TL DOES have a nasty beak and is sorta ponderous. The TSX IS downscale from these cars but still a cool rig. The CTS - despite what Pletko thinks - IS an American car. "
"plekto","November 2010"," Yes, but it's unlike anything GM has produced to date. It punks almost everything from Japan and most of the stuff out of Europe and was designed with European tastes and drivers in mind.But yeah, it is made by a U.S. based company. "

My wife seems to think we need a bigger back seat but that is a minor consideration for me - it would get little use.I'll really have to give the CPO 535 some thought - I really hadn't considered buying a used car but I can see it has its advantages.The CTS isn't a player for me, though I'm sure it's a nice car.

"plekto","November 2010"," Kind of odd, though, that you won't consider a pre-owned CTS while you will consider a pre-owned 535. They are fairly similar. But the CTS is a lot less expensive as a CPO vehicle and quite a bit more reliable as well.Another car to try out - and this is a bit of an oddball, but bear with me - is the RX8. It fits 4 adults just fine, and the oddly shaped rear doors aside, it's basically a 4 door sport sedan. Fantastic ride, though - just a tiny bit slower than a Boxster and handles as well, too. The last would be either a Saab or Volvo. Other than that, well, you're stuck with crossovers and SUVs. It honestly sounds like your wife wants a RAV4 or similar and you want a 3 series and you're stuck in a no-man's land of trying to find the perfect compromise. Except that compromises by nature aren't perfect and never will be. P.S. If you want Audi at less money, just get the VW version. But expect to pay a lot in repairs and upkeep for both.

"plekto","November 2010"," I was a little sarcastic, but I guess it got lost in translation. He's pretty much unhappy with everything, and really he's got maybe Mazda, Mitsubishi, and Volvo left.  He wants something sporty and that handles well, and we're out of options, really. (I personally think his wife needs to get over the whole cargo/back seat thing unless they have 3 kids) It sounds like she wants a crossover/wagon.Oh, wait - I forgot one - the Lexus G. That's about all that's left. As for the VW/Audi comparison, it depends which models. He obviously thinks that the A4 is too small, so the next size larger, well there IS a VW that uses the A3 platform but is between the A4 and A6 in size (ie - the Passat) While they aren't literal clones, they share so much DNA and parts they might as well be fighting over who gets the china in the estate sale. I'd certainly not pay Audi prices without looking at the Passat first. "
"dap2006","November 2010"," Actually, I'm not unhappy with everything but simply weighing the pro's and con's - that was the point of soliciting other's opinions. Your sarcasm seems to flow from frustration with my not considering your GM options, but as I originally posted, I'm not a fan of the American offerings - nothing personal there.Likewise, I don't consider VW, Mazda, or Mitsubishi as acceptable alternatives. And while my wife prefers a larger back seat than an A4, I don't think that confines us to Rav 4's or SUV-type options.To get back to the discussion, at this point my best bets seem to be a G37, M37, BMW 5 series (new or more likely CPO) - still thinking (and thanks to all!) "
"Kirstie_H","November 2010"," I'll throw in my $0.02 here, realizing that that's all it is...You're likely to get much more bang for your buck by going used on any of the 3 vehicles at the top of your list. I'd look for off-lease / CPO vehicles. In my experience, leased vehicles are often more well-looked after if for no other reason than the person leasing fears extra charges at lease turn-in. I bought a G35 several years ago off-lease and it had taken a pretty significant depreciation hit.... I've beat the tar out of it mileage-wise and mechanically it's still perfect. YMMV. "
"dap2006","November 2010"," I'm going to look into the CPO options, though I like the idea of leasing - new car, no trade-in hassle, and frequency of change being attractive. "
"Kirstie_H","November 2010"," You seem to have a pretty good idea of your wants & needs, and that's great. I'm sure you'll end up with what's right for you. The only aspect of leasing vs. buying CPO for *me* is that I can get a used G-series with a shorter (than 5 year) term loan and the payment on that is about the same as a lease payment (assuming there are up-front costs associated with the lease), and after 3 yrs or so, I own the vehicle and can use the trade-in value on a new vehicle. Something to thing about and research, but in the end you should just do what you can afford and what makes you happiest! "
"plekto","November 2010"," I could have sworn that I also pointed that out before as well. :P Why lease when you can own it for the same money a year or two older? Everyone that I know who has done this instead has had a lot less stress and worries as well, because there's no issues with mileage, wear, or other idiocy that they make you go through with a typical lease. And the interest rates are often quite a bit better on a car loan versus a lease when you crunch the numbers.The cars you are looking at are fine, really - I happen to like the CTS. But that's literally the ONLY GM or Ford car that I can stand - I'm certainly no fan and would buy a Mercedes or similar in a heartbeat over anything else they make. I've owned a (used) S Class in the past and the Domestics have a LONG way to reach that level. For the first three months I'd constantly be amazed just getitng into it and playing with the options. - there was a literal chasm between my previous Buick and the Mercedes. It died - sad story there. Then I got a 4x4 Two other cars to look at would be the E class and the Lexus GS350. These depreciate quickly and are two excellent ""hidden gems"" in the CPO world. A 2007 GS 350 should run you about 25K and a 2009 E class (built on the new more reliable C class platform, but stretched) should be about 30K.Optimally, 4 years old is the sweet spot between age and pricing, but the E class came out in 2009. The 2008 and earlier models were a disaster to keep running by comparison.IIRC, Mercedes also has new car financing (1.9%) and leases on CPO models from time to time.(yes, lease a CPO used car - C class payments on a E class) Lexus might have changed to this as well in reaction - You'd have to check for specifics.edit - they DO have 1.9% for 48 months on CPO C class models right now - it's going to be hard to beat that price-wise. The new/better body style started in 2008. IMO, the rear seats in the new C class are roomier than in the G37. The panoramic sunroof is incredible as well. "
"Kirstie_H","November 2010"," well, you do get the full warranty in force for (usually) the duration of ownership if you lease. I can understand why that would be attractive. And, if you consider trading in to be a hassle that is just not worth the effort, there's another reason.I wouldn't lease, but I can understand why some people do. "
"igozoomzoom","November 2010"," ""I'm going to look into the CPO options, though I like the idea of leasing - new car, no trade-in hassle, and frequency of change being attractive.""BMW Financial Services and Infiniti Financial Services both offer leases on CPO vehicles, just like new ones. BMW limits the lease term to no more than 48 months on vehicles that aren't current model year, but that's the only major difference that I am aware of. The lease payments should also be quite a bit lower than new without the hit of first year depreciation!BMW CPO warranty extends the New Car Full Vehicle 4-year/50k warranty to 6-years/100k miles. Infiniti also extends the warranty to 6yrs/100k. If you decide to check out Infiniti CPO offerings, I still find the previous-generation (2006-2010) M35/M45 very appealing....especially the M35 Sport model! =) "
"edwardsf","November 2010"," I just finished a lease and much prefer my current option of owning a CPO. Kirstie is right; there is some pressure in having a leased car as you are afraid every ding or tear will be costly. Also, I never felt it was my car ('because it wasn't,' someone will say ; - ). But leasing a CPO is an interesting idea - no depreciation and you get frequency of change BTW, I think the BMW CPO is not quite as good as you have it described. When the new car warranty ends the CPO begins. It is consecutive, not cumulative. So, if you have 50k and 2years when you buy a CPO car, the new car warranty ended at 50k. So you only get 2 years or 40k miles of CPO - whatever is less.  I think you pay $50 when you take it in for CPO repairs. Also, the CPO also excludes a few items that are covered in the new car. Still, for $22,000 off the MRSP of a car with no model changes, I will take it. "
"r34","November 2010"," There is no deductible for the CPO program of Saab (the dealers were more generous to define an issue as warranty work too) but there is a $50 deductible (per service visit) for Audi, BMW, and Infiniti.Several of my friends got G35 and FX34/45 with no extended warranty or CPO, they seem to be doing fine.CPO is a way to go for European cars. The repair could be expensive. I had 3 Saabs. They had good engines but got minor issues. The 9-5 Aero was the best and I still missed it. I wanted to try something different.I tried the G35x but was not impressed. I was looking at Infiniti EX/FX and BMW 530xi but ended up with a 335xi (love the twin turbo and I didn't need backseats). I traded one Saab for a V6 A4 and another Saab for a 335xi (I need AWD for my daily commute to Milwaukee from Chicago).Except the 1st Saab, I bought them all as used (CPO). No big issues with them. The A4 seems to be better. VW is still unreliable but Audi seems to be ok now (mine has zero problem). I test drove the Passat. Audi and VW are different! I like the interior and the image of of Audi (good for road trip) but I like the power and handling of the Bimmer. If the new S4 is really as good as the 335i, I will definitely get the S4.If backseats is a MUST, I would pick 535i. "

"
"nyccarguy","November 2010"," CPO cars are a great way to ""save"" money in this ultra competitive Entry Level Luxury Performance Sedan segment. You still have to do some digging & not just take the dealer's word for it as all CPOs are not created equal. Some dealers look at the car with a more finely tuned microscope than others. Check into the service records. Is it a local car serviced by the selling dealership or was it bought at a company auction? One poster on the X3 board (from AZ I think) test drove a CPO X3 that he felt wasn' up to snuff. Something about the back window regualtors being faulty, he ended up buying the X3 in CA I think. You still are buying a used car.From a ""deal"" standpoint, leasing a CPO car doesn't make sense. For the simple reason that no 2 CPO cars are alike. The dealer can set their own lease rates & money factors. It isn't like leasing new where there is a November program and the lease rate on every 2011 335i w/ X drive sedan is 0.XXXX or residual is XX%. There are just way too many variables that the dealer controls that you as a consumer don't have access to. Even the asking prices are arbitrary. You could negotiate a fantastic deal of $5K off, and then they jack up the lease rate and say the bank set a low residual.Free Scheduled maintenance is a crucial sticking point that makes BMW stand out. Yes were are all smart enough that it is built into the car and it isn't technically free. But however they do it, it makes sense. Now many of us use indie mechanics once the warranty period is up, but to prove BMWs practice is valid, you have to assume that people are taking their cars to the dealer for service.BMWs 1st service comes at around 15K miles. Gets you an oil change.Now my wife has a 2010 Acura TSX. I had the oil & filter changed at 4500 miles (Synthetic), even though the service advisor begged me to wait until the light goes one (10,000 miles). I think it was a little over $100 with a tire rotation.Service #2 which is technically the 1st service is what I did at 4500 miles $100+.I did at 10,000 miles.Service #3 I did at 20,000 miles and I specifically instructed them to only do synthetic oil,filter, & tire roatation.Many of Acura's ""services"" they offer are nothing more than visual checks of belts, hoses,lights... along with the oil change & tire rotation probably cost a few hundred dollars.BMW's 2nd service is an Inspection I service which is a major service at around 30K miles.Sometime after the 2nd service you are going to need brakes and rotors on your 3 series. At least the fronts. My parents had to have this done on my Mom's '08 328xi also right after the odometer said 50K and it was $700. They also recently had an Inspection II done (out of warranty) and the car needed rear brakes - $900.No it it almost isn't fair to compare the TSX to the rest of these because it is by far the least expensive car in the segment.But take your run of the mill car that's sitting on the luxury dealer's lot which in CT/NY/NJ means AWD, Automatic, Premium Pkg, Cold Weather Pkg, NAV and the sticker prices(328i w/ X Drive, C300 SPort 4 Matic, IS250 AWD, CTS4, A4 2.0T Premium, G37X) can't be that far off, so you definitely have to factor in free maintenance into the equasion. The MSRPs on ALL these cars are north of $40,000. "
"nyccarguy","November 2010"," CPO cars are definitely worth mentioning in this discussion. There are a lot of these Entry Level Luxury Performance Sedans that are leased for whatever the reason. There is a school of thought out there that these cars (especially European makes, totally unfounded BTW) ""turn into pumpkins"" once the twarranty runs out. The fact is that all of these cars are exceptionally well built and are priced accordingly between $40<000 & $50,000. My experience with the '01 Prelude (130K miles) leads me to believe that these (and most modern) cars will run well past 50K miles with no major problems as long as you maintain them.I've only bought new since my 16th birthday, but I'd strongly consider a used 3 or G as my next ride. Payments on a high $20K car are a lot easier to swallow than on a $40- $50K car. "
"sweendogy","November 2010"," i agree with car guy--i bot a new G 3.5 years ago now and for close to 40k -- lot of money over 3 years -- 2 weeks ago for my wife we got a 2007 cr-v -(dont laugh) but the 2010s were over 30k fully loaded - her 2007 saved me 12k from new is certified by honda and has only 19k miles on it.. we were also able to pick and choose the one we wanted (just like new) and as a second car it was a no brainer. "
"smarty666","November 2010"," I tend to agree with you about CPO, especially with the Germans, since they don't retain their resale value as well as the Japanese, by getting CPO with them, your not taking the brunt of the depreciation like the original owner has. Only disadvantage to CPO is that most, not all, but most of the CPO's I see on the luxury lots you have no idea how the previous owner took care of it (what kind of oil did they use, tires rotated properly, cleaned interior regularly, etc). I've found most do nothing to keep up the leather and vinyl interiors and they look like utter crap at only the 2 or 3 year mark when they are back on the lot as CPO and then you have a pain in the butt time trying to undo the neglect the first owner did. The stealers did little as possible to really clean up the car for used sales again, especially on the interior. But from a value proportion, money, and just to be in a luxury name, I can definitely see the attraction to CPO! "
"sweendogy","November 2010"," smarty i would of guessed the germans (certainly bmw) would keep values-- i mean they lease more bmws then other cars in the group (my guess is the TL is prob second on the lease vs buy list) and the main reason is resale value-- prob part of the reason why bmw offered free oilchanges and other things to get people to lease a car that costs over 45k..plus bmw could sell a 3 year old 3 series for over 30k. I would dissagree with you on your CPO diss- the CPO report includes past maintenance -(btw is this the same lot you talked about hyundai, in the TL chat?) and if a car is certified i would wonder why bmw/audi/ infiniti would sell a car that was not properly cared for..certainly with whats going on with toyota and if there is data to say the car was not up to certification-- you think they want bad press for including a car that has not infact passed the 150 pt inspection. Your talking about a 3 year old car that has less then 40k miles on it-- how bad is the leather?? does it have rips?? how they cared for it--come on -- if it has a rip the dealer fixes it. I have no idea where you are looking at CPO's (the same hyundai dealer ?)-- but you should look to see what reports on each car are avail before making such comments on ""MOST"" CPOS..Value yes -- lux name yes-- attraction yes.-- :shades: "

"smarty666","November 2010"," you need to do more readings on resale values, the Japanese have always had a edge over that then the Germans; there is nothing wrong with that, heck the Germans retain value better than the American brand still so its all good whether you go Japanese or German in regards to resale value and depreciation. Check out ALG website for the residual value awards and you'll see Acura tops the list for the last 2 or 3 years I believe, several other sites list Acura as top for resale value followed closely by Lexus and Infiniti. I hate to break it to you but CPO does not include past maintenance; I've returned plenty of lease vehicles from different manufacturers over the years who did not even care to see my maintenance records so there is no possible way for them to know, when they act like that at lease return, how the car was maintained and I'm sorry, but I've seen plenty of 2, 3, and 4 year old CPO cars out on the stealers lots for sale with really bad interior care from the previous owners; some of the stealers do the bare minimum when they put the cars back out on the used car lot for sale, you want to know why ""ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS MAKING MONEY, THEY ARE A BUSINESS"" I'm talking about some scratches, rips, severe wrinkles, discoloring, etc on the leather/vinyl; this is noticeable, at least to a car guy like me who takes excessive care of his vehicles, maybe not to the common folk but to me; some of the interiors look like the leather is 7, 8, or 9 years old when its really only 3 or 4. You can tell when looking at a vinyl or leather interior whether its been kept up or not. Your naive if you think that all the stealers really do all that they say they do in their marketing ploys for CPO. They just make sure things work in the car and that nothing is broken, and they give the car a wash and wax before putting it out on the lot. And if you read what I said carefully, which you rarely do, I said the CPO's I HAVE SEEN, most had interiors that were very worn and not kept up! "
"smarty666","November 2010"," She's in nice shape! I can tell just by the pictures that you take care of her on a regular basis. The conditions I am talking about are nothing like that! Was that the condition you got her in or is that after years of your tender love and care?  "
"roadburner","November 2010"," Was that the condition you got her in or is that after years of your tender love and care? The picture was taken last summer, but it looked the same when we bought it; most of our friends thought it was a brand new truck.On BMW vehicles you can verify the dealer service/repair history if you have the last seven digits of the VIN; right now I'm looking at a 37K mile 2007 CPO 335i and I know where, when, and what services have been performed.

(groundhogs day, good movie)I hate to break it to YOU but CPO does include a copy of past maintenance -- give me you fax number i will send you a copy of the 07 crv cpo sheet that i asked for before i signed..i'm sure you returned a bunch of cars, and they were prob in good shape but computers now track maintaince. If your buying a 2-3 year old car you should expect a couple of scratches and minor wear-- its a used car..hello.I know they are in it to make money--But they come with a warranttee and the check list of things done with the car to make it a CPO-- including tires, breaks, whatever and if something is needed it should be fixed--and if the consumer is smart they can have the car checked out before its bought.Your right i sometimes zoneout when reading your longposts i'm sorry could be my OCD..but you have to admit your statements about all the cars you have seen i mean its pretty funny how you always have a story to discount the previous poster... all those cars with bad leather.. oh man "
"smarty666","November 2010"," it doesn't include maintenance if you haven't had it done at the dealership and they DON'T TAKE THE FREAKING PAPERWORK that you have as proof when you return your vehicle back in! I have had it happen with Infiniti, MB, and Caddy. Acura was the only one who took my maintenance records when I returned the vehicle! Here is your proof for ALG residual value since you have to be such a pestering noob about it! It will be interesting to see how you twist and turn this link and its information to suit your own purpose.https://www.alg.com/ResidualValueAwardsInfiniti actually took the top spot from Acura who has had it for the last two years. Good for Infiniti. Seriously, what is wrong with you that you don't get what I'm saying. I have leased many luxury vehicles and some of the makes don't even collect maintenance records. I didn't have the stuff done at the dealership. Even if a computer records it, there is no way for the computer to know what grade, type, content of fluids and/or gas someone is putting in.I do have to say, that not all CPO's are equal. I know Acura and BMW have some stringent CPO standards compared to the rest. When I turned my Acura in, they wanted all my maintenance records which I happily gave them. Others, were much more lazy and didn't really care about the maintenance of the vehicle as long as it passed the return inspection and nothing was severely damaged (Infiniti, MB, and Caddy were the biggest culprits of this). Talk about the kettle calling the pot black, you complain about the fact that I supposedly say ALL vehicles, when in actuality I say either MOST or SOME, which is not all and then you can't leave Acura owners alone b/c of your sour experience with them and that ALL their products aren't great and you can't figure out why people are choosing them over others. And again, I said MOST of the one's I SEE! Does that mean all vehicles, no, so stop putting words in my mouth and twisting around what I say! I'm talking about the CPO vehicles I've seen on all the luxury manufacturers lot that have really worn, faded, sometimes severely wrinkled interiors. There are some that are not like that. I never implied that all CPO's are like that or said that. But there are some that dealers think are acceptable, when they really aren't and still put them out on the lot without doing a lot of cleaning and reconditioning to them. I state facts man, unlike you, who sole goal on edmunds is to argue with people. :sick: "
"sweendogy","November 2010"," another long post.. .you have a FOURLOKO before you wrote it. Nice work with the link - nice work with your wording making sure it was correct on this post. kettle black, nice touch.. How do you know that some Cpos are more stringent then others? does that include MOST, SOME or ALL of the Lux manufactures?My past comments on acura are my comments- but those comments were backed with comparision tests -and performance numbers-thus having proof-- but I still hate the current styling, no doubt and i think the car is far behind in performance but ahead on technology. you must have a lot of time looking at all those CPO on the Lux lots-- you happen to see a 2008-2009 335xi 6 speed with sport, nav andd premium package? how did the seats look?

Been in new TL (service loaner) and was not impressedMy 2000 Infiniti has aged more gracefully then 2008 Acura.Having said that its best bang for buck...if thats what you are looking for.I would look at Infiniti G or may be M. "
"nyccarguy","November 2010"," sanjaysdca - 20K on an '08 MDX? You gotta get out and drive more my man. We purchased my wife's 2010 TSX Tech at the end of August 2009 & she has over 24,000 miles on it already. The leather, specifically the left side bolster on the driver's seat definitely shows some signs of premature wear. Probably my one knock against the car (other than the fact that it isn't rear wheel drive & I'm not a fan of the electric power steering).I just built a handful of these ELLPS during my lunch break. I configured each vehicle to the level of equipment on the TL SH AWD. Even at this price point, value has to come into play somehow. All cars have manual transmissions as I'd get.Acura TL SH AWD - $43,445Infiniti G37S - $40,325Audi A4 2.0T Prestige (Metallic Paint, S Line Sport Package) $45,250BMW 328i $45,150(Premium, Sport, Cold Weather, iPod, Sirius, Xenon, HK, Nav, Met Paint)BMW 335i $52,200(Cold Weather, Premium, Sport, Nav, HK, iPod, Sirius, Met Paint)The TL is deinitely the biggest car. So if you want performance, plus room for 4 full sized adults, and a generous sized trunk, the TL is your car. I actually dig the styling of the TL in it's SH AWD guise. It definitely has a presence about it on the road. I love the lip spoiler on the back & the faux quad exaust. The wheels look sharp. It gets fantastic reviews & write ups. Your best bang for the buck in this segment is definitely the Infiniti. That's a whole lot of horsepower for your just over $40K sticker. They give BIG discounts on these too.I think the A4 is a nice looking car, but am not sure if a 4 cyl cuts the mustard with it's $45K price tag. I know it is probably the best turbo 4 on the market, but it is still a 4. Good amount of passenger room, nice sized trunk.Dynmanically, the BMWs are the best. Nothing comes close to the way a 3 series drives. $52K is a lot of money for a car the size of a Honda Civic. $45K is a lot to ask of a 230 hp car. I know it isn't about straightline acceleration & 0-60 mph times. "
"sanjaysdca","November 2010"," sanjaysdca - 20K on an '08 MDX?I guess I have to agree with you here...but my office is 10 miles one way and my wife telecommutes...and everything we need/want is within 10 mile radius...so most of the miles are recreational.Back to cars...I have driven loaners TSX and TL and I prefer TSX over TL.Your price points are interesting. Didn't think TL is that expensive. As far as BMW and Dynamics go, I think BMW were good dynamically but the new ones are more luxury-less performance. I testdrove brand new 2011 BMW 5 series and 2010 5 series and found older model to be more satisfying to drive. "
"sweendogy","November 2010"," for the price i would add the new volvo-- yes volvo s60 to the forum- it has 300hp sporty styling and is safe-its right in the pricing wheelhouse and has been given new blood- the boston globe said it was the best car they tested for 2010. For around 40k-1I would go 2009 CPO BMW 335xi, 6 speed depending on how the leather looked.G37CPO new model S4, the one with the v6 not 8 (if you could get one for that price)Lexus IS 350x, TSX 6 speed, 328xi 6 speed, the little 6 is plenty quickA4 agree to much $$ for what you get, current TL beergoogles needed, volvo S60?? "
"nyccarguy","November 2010"," The Acura's huge discount factor isn't taken into account here. I didn't have a chance, but go on edmunds or truecar & see what these TLs are selling for. You get a hefty chunk taken off the MSRP. Styling is a very subjective matter. I like the TL SH AWD's styling. I'm also a big fan of the former E60 BMW 5 series styling as compared to the current F10. I also prefer the E60 to the former E39 (ducking and running). "

"nyccarguy","December 2010"," Much as it did that winter night/morning in Buffalo during the late fall of 1996. I was at a cliub with some friends in Buffalo (I went to college about 2 1/2 hours away in Ithaca). My friend who I was visiting (and at the club with) was in a shall we say intoxicated state and getting very friendly with a 6' tall blonde. At about 3:30 AM I decided I had had enough and wanted to go back to his place to crash. ""Chris, give me your keys. I'll meet you back at your place later. Call me if you need a lift.""With the flick of his wrist, he tossed me the keys to his 1995 E36 BMW 325is. Red/Black leather. 5 speed manual transmission. HK, Sunroof, & most importantly Sport Package + additional factory lowering.Now up until this point, I was a novice at driving stick and had never had any real seat time in a BMW. I thought they were for ""show offs."" My entire point of view changed by the time I took off from the 1st traffic light. I had never driven a car that I just felt so perfect in. I drove the car around the streets of Buffalo for the next 2 1/2 hours. By the end of the night, I was steering around right turns with the throttle & rotating around corners perfectly. I've wanted a BMW ever since.Fast forward to December 2, 2010. The numbers don't mean a whole helluva lot. BMW gets good money for their cars and they are worth every penny. I've got my Mom's '08 E90 BMW 328xiA (almost 61,000 miles) until Saturday. Even saddled with all wheel drive & automatic transmission, it is still a true driver's car. You all know how much I love my '01 Prelude Type SH (almost 132,000 miles). My Mom's BMW is one of the few cars I've driven that almost make my Prelude feel ""loose."" The drive from my parents house in Rockland County, NY to my house in Stamford, CT changed my mind and reinvigorated my passion for BMWs. I'd take a 328i with its 230 horsepower, no NAV, leatherette, sports package, & 6 speed stick. It is just an amazing car to drive. I would even consider a CPO or private party used (as long as the person has service records & the car passes a PPI) and I've only owned new cars my entire driving life since I got my license. "

"fedlawman","December 2010"," Thanks for a great story NYC! Very nice memories. For me, when I was in the Army, I was passing through Dallas to spend a few days with my uncle (yes, the one with a thing for Acuras). Back in the 80's and 90's, he was strictly a BMW guy (320i, 325e, then 325i). We went on a liquor run to OK and he let me drive his then new E30. Up until that point, all I had owned/driven was my dad's Accord, and my Alfa Romeo Spider and CRX Si.I had a similar epiphany - how could such a simple car (my uncle is minimalist - his E30 had NO options) be so much better than anything I had ever driven. Of course, I didn't have the scratch to buy a BMW so I owned many more imitators before I finally got the real thing.They really are that good. Sublime. "

New S60 really is a vastly different car to the outgoing model and made my '06 S60 D5 Geartronic seem positively wooden by comparison. Mag reviews are fine for rough comparison...............you need to drive 'em to really find out. Before I drove the S60 I was thinking; ""Hmm so it's a re-skin"". After 4 hours of all kinds of silliness I was smitten. It's a new car from the wheels up. "
"nyccarguy","December 2010"," If I were to order one, it would have a 6-speed stick, Sport Pkg, Heated Seats, iPod/USB, Sirius, Xenon, Leatherette, Sunroof, & Metallic Paint. "
"qbrozen","December 2010"," What annoys me about their sales pitch on the new S60, though, is calling it the ""sportiest volvo ever."" Here in the US, at least, the T6 only comes with an automatic. The S60R had the same peak engine outputs, was a lighter car, and was available with a stick. Gotta tip yer hat to that as being more sporty, if not even the sportiest. "
"qbrozen","December 2010"," ordering? yeah, I'd probably add bun warmers, Sirius, and Xenons, as well. Moonroof is not on my list. I'd rather do without to save weight. And, for some reason, I hate paying for paint. "
"roadburner","December 2010"," At the age of 14 I coerced my dad into test driving a 1972 Bavaria. The salesman drove it first and demonstrated how well it cruised at 120 mph. I was hooked, but I didn't end up with my own BMW until 1983 when I bought a 1973 Bavaria- which my girlfriend at the time(and now my wife of almost 25 years) had found for me. She had wisely determined that the way to my heart led through the garage... "
"nyccarguy","December 2010"," I don't like the idea of paying for paint either. Does it really cost an extra $550 to paint a car a different color. The E90 looks terrific in so many colors. The Vermillion Red looks amazing. I know sunroofs add weight, but I like 'em.Funny thing about paying for paint. My Mom's lease is up on her 328xi at the end of this month. She ordered a Porsche Cayenne V6. Called me up after she visited the dealer & gushed about the truck. After she told me what options she specd out, I asked her what color. She told me White. This took me by surprise as she's never come close to wanting a white car. Now the white happens to be a fantastic color for the Cayenne. I said: White? She told me she refuses to pay $800 for a specific color & she really loves the white. "
"nyccarguy","December 2010"," I had a college friend who had a 1984 E30 BMW 325e with a 5 speed stick. The car was 10 years old and had well over 100K miles on the odometer. The speedometer didn't work. One day we're cruising the back roads of Ithaca, NY & I asked him how he knew how fast he was going. He tells me it clicks on every once in a while. We went over a bump in the road, the car got some air & when it landed, the speedo clicked on & read 105 mph. The car was amazingly solid & stable at that speed.BMWs are special cars no doubt. "
"roadburner","December 2010"," Back in 1984 I was driving my 1973 Bavaria through PA on our way home from our first BMW CCA Oktoberfest. It was a drizzly Sunday morning and my wife was reading a mystery novel. My CB and first generation Escort indicated a threat-free environment so I slowly eased the old sled up to a 100 mph cruise, which I maintained for almost two hours. My wife's only comment was ""Wow, it took us almost no time to cross Pennsylvania.""Four years later I was evaluating an early E32 750i outside Rochester New York. I took it up to 125 mph and asked my wife how fast she thought we were going. She guessed 80 mph... "
"kyfdx","December 2010"," ... I have boring stories about my indoctrination into BMWs, as well, but I'll save those for another time...The speed thing, though...

The other guy is sitting upfront with me, we have a conversation going, and the women are in the back with their own conversation.. From the back, I hear... ""Geez... let's open this thing up and see what it will do"" (not my wife, obviously).. ""Well... uh.. we are already doing 105... how fast do you want to go?"" It's amazing how smooth and controlled German cars can be at speed... she had no idea we weren't going 55 mph. "
"nyccarguy","December 2010"," I had to really watch myself. Looked down a few times and was going over 90 & Mom's 328xi felt completely planted & stable. Having the 300/300 N55 motor would be complete overkill for me. "

"saratoga3","January 2011"," group,just wondering if anyone out there has looked at the Nissan Maxima? I have expanded my serach from Lexus and Infiniti and would appreciate any comments. "
"plekto","January 2011"," It's a fine car, though to me it seems a bit ""last generation"". IMO, there's zero reason to buy it instead of the G37. IMO, it's a bit like the Buick Lucerne or Grand Marquis in that it's a vehicle that's left over/still being produced and stuck in an odd place, because it's not really filling any specific role/market segment at this point. They've always made the Maxima and probably always will. For me, though, the CVT in the Maxima just kills it completely. And it's needlessly pricey to fix. You'd think less parts would equate to a cheap fix.But I do understand your wanting to look at other options. Lexus seemed overpriced and stodgy to me - and everyone has one, it seems. BMW makes a nice car, as does Mercedes, but cost to own is high(love the new E class, though.. wish I could afford to own one). Audi's larger vehicles are gorgeous inside but also suffer from maintainance woes. The list quickly dwindles.I'd look at the Acura TL or possibly the CTS (you didn't specify sporty or luxury preference) Both can be had for about 32K through various sites like Truecar. It turns out they all are using the same back end call centers - I got a quote from Truecar and a couple of other sites recently and got the same receptionist on the phone (though different agents). So it works well enough to get an idea at least of the price locally. "
"smarty666","January 2011"," Unlike pleko, I can give a better balanced impression on the Maxima since I have the new one and considered it heavily against the G37. There is plenty of reason to buy a Maxima and sales of the current gen prove that, but it depends on what your looking for specifically. If you don't have a family or a big family and want something with a luxury bad, better materials, and a sport firm ride/handling then the G37 is the one that makes the most sense. If your like me and want something that is more a roomier family sedan but with a sport look/flair to it then the Maxima fits the bill better. The maxima is much more comfortable inside and if you get the premium package you get the heated steering wheel, power rear sunshade, dual moonroof, cooled front seats, auto dimming side mirrors, sport bucket seats, and a couple of other goodies that you can even get on the G37. To me, the Maxima is the best handling FWD sedan I have ever driven to date. Its got a great turning circle for its size, just the right ride quality balance, and if driven properly, yields decent mpg with the CVT. Only thing is, if you've never had a CVT before, it's going to take you about 2-3 months to get used to it. It was odd at first, but after 1.5 years, it seems like normal to me and I have had zero problems with it in almost 17 miles. This gen max is a world's different from the last one and to me has a much more stand out body style then the G37 does but that vehicle itself is due for a redesign in 2012. I suggest you test drive both vehicles, like I did, and see which one suits your needs better. They are two different vehicles, despite what anyone else on here leads you to believe. "
"shipo","January 2011"," The single largest ""fail"" vis-?-vis the Maxima is that it is no longer available with a stick; the G37 can still be had with three pedals under the dash. "
"plekto","January 2011"," What got me was that the Maxima is only 3 inches longer than the G37 size-wise. It's mostly sheet metal. FWD and CVT makes it frankly into an Avalon or Lucerne clone - it's nice and spacious, but it has a serious problem competing with the big RWD luxury cars. "
"saratoga3","January 2011"," thanks for the replies, I drove the G but not the Max yet. I like a car with some room and the G was a little cramped. I did own a 01 Max that I loved, but the new ones are totally different.Also, have some concerns on gas mileage with the G but you give that up for performance. "
"fedlawman","January 2011"," Have you driven the Hyundai Genesis? You really should. "
"mz6greyghost","January 2011"," Sorry smarty, but if you cannot give a ""better balanced"" impression of something you paid $$$$ for, compared to a casual observer that hasn't spent any of their own $$$$ on a product.Having said that, I agree with pletko on a lot of points. The current-gen Maxima is a shell of a car that it used to be. The ""four-door Sports Car"" moniker than Nissan used for it is long since gone, and it's been replaced by a sedan that doesn't fit into any distinct category anymore. It's essentially NOT an entry-level lux sedan (as much as Nissan would like it to be) because the materials and fit-and-finish pales in comparison to G (which is essentially the same price). It's too expensive to be a viable midsize sedan, and why spend a few grand more for a nameplate when the Altima can be optioned similarly for a lower price?If you're looking for some room, the Caddy CTS is a good alternative, as well as the aforementioned Genesis. Also check out the Acura TL. "
"smarty666","January 2011"," Nissan got rid of the stick b/c when they offered is NO one was buying it and it got the point that they were losing money on the ones they were spending the time making a stick available on. So you know what, we only have ourselves to blame for that one. Now that Nissan no longer has it everyone whines about it but no one was buying it when it was here. "
"smarty666","January 2011"," I don't think its suppose to be a big RWD luxury competitor b/c if it was then there would be practically zero difference between it and a G37. Yeah, the Max is only 3 inches longer but its almost 4 inches wider which is what makes the difference and gives it so much more room. The G37 is designed to be a cramped sports sedan like a 3 Series. If you think the FWD and CVT has turned it into a Avalon and Lucerne clone then you really know nothing about the car. The Maxima rides and handles 10x better than both those vehicles and isn't even close in any driving dynamics. Plus, despite having the CVT, I've been able to keep up with plenty of regular automatics and manuals with the car so its performance capabilities aren't void or completely handicapped b/c of it. That is just an excuse people use to not get the car. "
"smarty666","January 2011"," I don't need to be chastised b/c you don't agree with my assessment but I have much more experience then you do with both vehicles so give me a break. Your logic about the $$$$ factor makes no sense at all either. This coming from a guy who at the max (no pun intended) only test drove each vehicles for 10 minutes each. I test drove each vehicle 3 times and had a G as a loaner many times when my FX was in for routine maintenance. I actually agree with you that the Maxima is not a true 4DSC in its current set-up and that is not the fault of the car itself but Nissan's stupid marketing schemes which they still don't get but that is another subject. I don't think anybody but you placed it in the entry-level lux sedan segment b/c I sure as didn't say it was. It is classified typically as an upscale or premium sedan. Your comments tell me that you don't have a clue when it comes to either of these vehicles b/c the Maxima is not the same price as a G37. As I stated earlier, no one is paying near sticker for a fully loaded Maxima. Typically you can get one for $33-35k when its all said and done, while a G37 does not have as big of a reduction. I have seen most people getting them for $37-40k depending on how its loaded up. That's still a difference and price and there are many luxury sedan features your getting in the cheaper Maxima that you can't even get in the G sedan even loaded all the way up. Is the fit and finish the same as the G, of course not, but it doesn't pale in comparison as you claim it to be. Its the best interior Nissan has had on the Maxima ever and that says a lot considering the interior's they had pre 2007. I was worried that there wouldn't be a market for the new Max but there is and the sales success of it prove it. There are big differences between the Altima and Maxima now that warrants the higher price of the Max and its more refined in every way, I should know, I cross-shopped that as well with the Maxima. As I said, the Maxima has found a market niche as a sporty family sedan that can get great mpg for the power. Now if Infiniti ever decided to bring back a FWD sedan or coupe then your argument might have more value. "
"shipo","January 2011"," I don't think the situation is quite as simple as your explanation suggests. The Maxima used to be quite a sporty car relative to its competition in the market place, however, Nissan saw fit to supplant the Maxima in that market space with Infiniti G series while at the same time tarting up the Maxima to the point where only the barest smidgen of sporting intention remains. Did the tarting up process drive stick buyers away or did the lack of stick buyers force Nissan to tart the car up and take it into a different market segment? I suspect the former.Long story short, the Maxima is no longer qualified to compete in this segment, a segment of which it was a firm stake holder early in its earlier iterations. "
"smarty666","January 2011"," Well there are over 60,000 some people in 2010 that would disagree with you and at it stands it sells the best of any mainstream flagship sedan does. Problem with you logic is, the cars the Maxima competes with, Avalon, Azera Impala, Taurus, etc are not as sporty as the Maxima is and have sales not even close to it, except for the Impala which is just rent a car fodder. Its the sportiness for the competition in the market place it has right NOW. Is it has sporty as it used to be, no, but there is more than just a smidgen of sportiness left. The body style screams sport, the exhaust note screams sport, the acceleration is incredible, ride quality is definitely not Lexus cushy and gear toward the feedback side, and for FWD, it handles very responsively compared to the other FWD flagship sedans it competes with. I love how everyone says the maxima has no market and can't compete yet sales prove you completely wrong, especially if you compared it to the big/bloaty boat the previous generation was and sales failure it was. This generation at least started going back in the right direction after where it had been from 2004-2008. It blends family sedan comfort with some sporty driving characteristics. Something that both the Altima and G37 do not both due at the same time. The G37 is complete sports car while the Altima is a boring comfortable family sedan. The Maxima bridges some of the characteristics of each of those cars nicely. "
"shipo","January 2011"," So sixty thousand customers makes the Maxima a contender in this category; how do you figure? True, it is sportier than an Impala; so what?Exhaust note? Geez, I've heard late model Cadillac land yachts that sound better. Even still, since when was exhaust note a metric for measuring sportiness? Wait-wait, I know; it's a measure among the crowd that likes to put far can mufflers on their tiny little econo cars. :PAcceleration? Here again, not exactly an attribute that is the exclusive domain of sporty cars. I mean really, a Dodge Ram pick-up with a Hemi in it will handily show its taillights to a Maxima.Long story short, the Maxima has been bloated up to be a nice grand touring car, nicer than Impalas and the like, but not a very good competitor to the cars that make up this class. I know you disagree, but even with those sixty-thousand souls in your back pocket, you're still not going to sell your argument. "
"jimbres","January 2011","  Well there are over 60,000 some people in 2010 that would disagree with you and at it stands it sells the best of any mainstream flagship sedan does. If you go back & read Shipo's post, you'll note that nowhere in it did he say that the Maxima isn't a strong seller - only that it's no longer considered a sport sedan as it once was. Problem with you[sic] logic is, the cars the Maxima competes with, Avalon, Azera Impala, Taurus, etc are not as sporty as the Maxima is and have sales not even close to it, except for the Impala which is just rent a car fodder.I don't see a problem with Shipo's logic here. If the Maxima's chief competition comes from cars that aren't perceived as sporty, then it would logically follow from that fact that the Maxima itself is not perceived as sporty. I love how everyone says the maxima has no market and can't compete yet sales prove you completely wrong Once again, Shipo's argument doesn't rest on sales numbers. "
"smarty666","January 2011"," It's simple my friend. If there wasn't a market for it as you and other stated and it doesn't compete well in its class competition then it shouldn't sell well. Problem is it sells very well as I pointed out and almost every review I have read states its a huge improvement over the last generation Maxima.Do you hear an loud exhaust note on a Camry? and Accord? a Altima? a Avalon? no you don't. That's because there isn't anything sporty about them. Only vehicles that have sporty pretensions and characteristics would do that. Why would a manufacturer waste the time to design and do that if it wasn't suppose to sound aggressive? B/c they want it to have sporty characteristics. Acceleration, looks, handling, ride, etc are not attributes that make a sporty car? Your definition of what makes a sporty vehicle is puzzling to say the least. A Dodge Ram pick up with a Hemi in it will handily show it's taillights to a Maxima; so what? I would expect it to. Now your going off on crazy vehicle and engines comparisons. Talk about going all over the place. Actually, the Maxima has been decreased in size compared to its previous generation so it hasn't been bloated up. I'm puzzled as to what you think are the cars that make up this class? Since the Maxima is a premium mainstream flagship sedan then that is what class it is apart of. That means the car's in its class is the Impala, Taurus, Azera, and Avalon. It outsells and performs all those vehicles. Bottom line is, you don't even know what class of car the Maxima is in, despite the fact it is in the mainstream flagship sedan class, sells better than its competition, and is more aggressive and unique then those other vehicles as well. It's class has changed compared to 10 and 15 years ago and so has the rest of the car market. Infiniti didn't even have anything sporty 10-15 years ago so even with in Nissan itself there are different vehicles that they have to be careful they don't compete against. Your logic and others makes no sense that a car that sells as well as the Maxima does has no market and is not a good competitor for its class. Even with your put downs and contradictions, your still not going to sell your argument. "
"smarty666","January 2011"," I never said the Maxima was a sports sedan. I said it was sporty family sedan or put it another way, a family sedan with sport/aggressive characteristics. Actually his argument can rest on sales numbers him and others said that its not class competitive and there is no need or market for it. Sales numbers prove that there is a market for it or people wouldn't buy it in the numbers that they are. Second, saying that b/c the Maxima's chief competition come from cars that are not sporty thus making the Maxima itself not perceived as sporty is just a gross generalization and to me isn't logical b/c in each car class their is always one or two vehicles that are different or an exception in certain characteristics then others. That's what makes test driving so important since the Maxima is very different with its driving dynamics then the others in the mainstream flagship class. That is the class the Maxima is in now, and it competes extremely well. I don't care what class it was in 10 or 15 years ago. Have to accept that is has changed to what it is today.Take the entry-level lux class for instance. An ES350, C-Class, IS, A4 and Lacrosse are more on the dull, less sporty side of vehicles but the 3-Series and G37 are the polar opposite of that. That would make a huge assumption about those sport sedan vehicles that b/c its in a class with a majority of less sporty (or luxury focus vehicles) they are not sport sedans as well. That of course would be a wrong assumption just like it is about a Maxima not having sporty driving characteristics. "
"jimbres","January 2011","  Your logic and others makes no sense that a car that sells as well as the Maxima does has no market and is not a good competitor for its class. Even with your put downs and contradictions, your[sic] still not going to sell your argument.Do you own a Maxima? If so, do you like it? If you do, why does it matter to you what Shipo, I or anyone else thinks of it?It's clear from your last couple of posts that you're getting a bit excited.

We're talking about cars here - not the things that are really worth arguing about: books, music & single-malt scotch. Just relax & have some fun. "
"smarty666","January 2011"," If you had read the posts from the last day you would have seen that I had mentioned I had gotten a Maxima. I was trying to offer advice and information for the OP who wanted to know the difference between the G37 and Maxima since he was considering the two vehicles. Since I have the new Max and I test drove and weighed it heavily against the G37, I thought I could provide some valuable insight into the differences between the two vehicles since I made a similar decision and what the pros and cons of each vehicle was. That is what I tried to do. Instead, I got criticized by several people for my comments and comparisons and got multiple put downs on my choice of vehicle and was told that it was not class competitive and there is no market for it :confuse: Very puzzling statements considering its sales numbers and how the market/class segment it now occupies has changed very much from what it was 10-15 years ago. "
"jimbres","January 2011","  Instead, I got criticized by several people for my comments and comparisons and got multiple put downs on my choice of vehicle and was told that it was not class competitive and there is no market for it Well, I did reread the posts that you're referring to & I can't find any that criticize you personally for driving a Maxima. Shipo merely pointed out that the latest generation Max isn't available with a stick & that in his eyes it's not as sporty as the earlier versions. All he was doing was expressing his opinion, which he has a right to do, & you went after him with a shotgun. You're too thin-skinned.I'm going to pull rank on you - you've been a member only since '09, but I've been here since '98 - & suggest that you calm down & have a little fun. We're here to entertain ourselves - nothing more. If someone actually learns something along the way, that's frosting on the cake, but that's not what attracts us in the 1st place. In my case, I can't go outside - not before my wife finishes shoveling the snow that fell last night - there's nothing good on TV & it's too early to start drinking. (This all sounds familiar. Didn't I point this out to you once before?)No matter what you drive, someone, somewhere will have an opinion about it that you won't like. Shrug it off. "
"Kirstie_H","January 2011"," Most excellent advice.No one's criticizing your children, your profession, your intellect - they're expressing a different opinion about whether your car is a class leader. Even if you post ONE more time that it sells well, the opinion will continue to differ. I've been around for ages as well, and I have yet to see anyone berated and argued into submitting to another member's opinion - I've seen them respond to fact, but opinion? No.The Hyundai Sonata is selling extremely well. Does that make it an ELLPS? No. That fact in no way detracts from the vehicles sales or appeal, but sales numbers do not indicate anything about the car apart from its appeal to consumers. Period.Let's avoid turning this discussion, and a very minor point within that discussion, into the Middle East conflict. "
"fedlawman","January 2011"," I personally think the Maxima is a nice car. It just isn't an ELLPS and doesn't warrant so much real estate in this forum. Maybe you should create a new thread: Maxima vs. LaCrosse vs. Taurus vs. Genesis. "
"Kirstie_H","January 2011"," The good news is that such a thread already exists:Mainstream Large SedansIt's not been active in awhile, but perhaps, as with many general discussions, it would see new life & activity with an on-topic post to stimulate conversation. "
"saratoga3","January 2011"," thanks smarty666 for your replies to my Maxima question, you have been very helpful. I feel responsible for this thread turning heated! my only intention was to get some feedback from members here who have shopped for the Max VS the Infiniti, the same as I have been doing. "
"smarty666","January 2011"," That was what I was trying to do in the first place, give you information to try and help make a decision. It basically comes down to this, both vehicles serve two different purposes, one is not vastly superior to the other, it all depends on what your personal situation is and what one fits your needs and driving style better. That is what I made the decision on when I was choosing between the two. "
"savetheland","January 2011"," I never saw new Maxima in person. Nissan evidently does not want to participate in autoshows. Last one in San Jose for some reason had Infinitis on display, but not Nissans. I saw Maxima on the road though and it has presence while G looks kind of cartoonish and funny with strange proportions. Anyway Infinity G is spacious inside at least for me, but it is like compact car in back and has smallish trunk - but it has RWD after all. So it is not efficient as a family car. Well what I actually wanted to say that I went to Nissan website and took a look. Agree - interior does not look like luxury car but is pleasant enough. The point I want to make is that I compared it with closest competitors - Buick Regal and Lincoln MKZ - all they are similar in every dimensions and purpose. It does not look like competitor to Avalon or Taurus which are larger cars.Then I went to truecar.com and configured Maxima with all options and got price around $33,600 in Bay area - almost 6K discount from sticker price. Similarly equipped entry level luxury cars, like A4, MKZ, G37 cost around 36K-37K according to truecar.com. Regal is priced similar to Maxima with 2.0T turbo engine. BTW A4 has engine similar to Buick and MKZ as engine similar to Maxima, but better interior quality. And I guess Buick is to A4 (both are German cars) same as Maxima to G. With exception that it has better exterior design and higher quality interior than Maxima. I would certainly test drive and compare Regal to Maxima, Regal may prove to be more sporty car after all (though Opel never had this kind reputation) and it is certainly more elegant. If you do not like G - CTS is most logical choice - it cost same 36k options but with 3.0L engine. True there is G25 Journey - but it is decontented car, it costs less. BMW is even smaller car than G and Lexus IS is smaller yet.I remember comparos where Maxima lost to Dodge Charger in its spoting intentions. Nissan after all is a large FWD car. I drove previous Maxima - it was smaller but no more sporty than base Mustang. I do not know from where sport-sedan notion comes from when people talk about Maxima. People use sport-sedan notion too often. I heard even Sonata called sport sedan which is absolutely ridiculous. "
"plekto","January 2011"," It is worth noting as well that the CTS is almost as good as a BMW 5 series in hard driving.(that said, 99% of us won't even get to those limits for either car) That base 3.0 is quite nice, and the 3.6 isn't really necessary. The interior as well is almost identical to an Acura or Audi in how well it's thought out and how nice it is. It feels properly luxurious and fits 4 adults quite easily.(though the G37 does that as well, I have to admit). The panoramic sunroof is awesome. And in a first for GM, the NAV system actually works.My only gripe with it is that you absolutely need the rear camera option or an aftermarket spoiler because you can't see the rear end while parking.(like the Civic, there are *zero* visual cues). But it's not alone in that, either. The worst offender currently is actually the new Honda Crosstour, which might as well be a utility van when it comes to driver visibility. It also could use something on the hood for the same reason - you kind of expect a Cadillac to have a hood ornament. It's an amazingly easy car to drive fast, but amazingly hard to park.Me, I don't parallel park if I can help it, so it's not an issue. Just something to be aware of.edit - truecar and cars direct say there are still some 2010 CTS models out there, so you might be able to get one for closer to 30-32K if you don't mind black. (27.5K for a base model(29 with auto), 30K for the Luxury, 32K for the Performance, and 34K for the 3.6) Almost all seem to be black or silver, which is usually what's left over.But.. even a base model CTS for ~29K... that makes every other mid-size sedan in the upper 20K range drop off of my radar. Especially the emasculated Regal. Got to love year end fire sales at GM.  "

"plekto","January 2011"," I'll talk about any of the older ""classic"" BMWs all day long  Not such a fan of the modern plastic and heavy stuff, though the 1 series is thankfully only a little bit over 3000lbs. "

"fedlawman","January 2011"," Well, most folks around here know I'll talk about e30's all day long. Unfortunately, it's not the topic of this thread.So, will the 1-series M qualify as the best ELLPS (I know, it's a coupe, but in a 3-box sort of way) on the planet? It's definitely piqued my interest. "
"plekto","January 2011"," The base model with manual is 3208lbs. A little weight trimming and a few aftermarket mods and you're looking at probably 3100lbs without too much expense. "
"roadburner","January 2011"," It's definitely piqued my interest. I came very close to ordering a a 2011 128i, optioned to my specs(M Sport Pkg, Cold Weather Pkg, Harman-Kardon audio, keyless entry, and xenons). Manual leather seats and no hole in the roof. My dealer was offering $2000 off MSRP. With BMW's $1500 Holiday cash and my $500 CCA rebate I was looking at @$32000+TTL. Good deal, but I kept thinking what I could buy used for similar money, such as a Z4 M Coupe or a Cayman. I'd have the same dilemma with the 1er M Coupe- for $47,000 I can get a CPO E9x M3 or better yet, a pristine 2005 0r 2006 E46 M3 ZCP(and have plenty of cash left over for a Brembo kit, pads, and track tires).

"saratoga3","January 2011"," I might get bet up about this here but has anyone considered the G25X instead of the 37X?The 25x is about 4k cheaper and if you can do without the xtra HP of the 37x it might be a good way to get into the car new, if you can do without some of the 37's options not available on the 25.You also gain about 2 xtra miles per gallon on the 25.Just something I was considering and thought others may have also?? I say the X because I live in the N East and would want it for the winter. "
"smarty666","January 2011"," Well, the biggest problem I have with the G25 is the lack of certain features at its price point that Infiniti decided to charge for it. I think the TSX I4 with tech is a much better option at the same price point plus your getting a nav system in that vehicle. The mpg of the G25 is not really that great considering it is only 1mpg better in city/highway miles compared to a RWD G37. It should be a lot better than 1mpg considering the difference in engines between a G37 and G25. Plus, the deals people have been reporting on the G37 and G25 are not that much different from one another. The G37 is not that much more per month and your getting a heck of a lot more car for the money with the G37 then you are with the G25. The G25 basically serves the purpose of getting people into the Infiniti brand without too much bells and whistles about it. I still fee the G37 is a much better buy over the G25, obviously for the sport enthusiast as well. "

"roho1","January 2011"," I don't understand why my post was censored. I quoted right from Edmond's page that the NM was worthy of comparison. The discussion was interesting and informative to any one looking at a ELLPS. It ran it's course and the thread will move on. Looking beyond the box never hurt anyone when shopping for a vehicle. I thought Edmonds was better than this I just saw Motor trend uses as a gauge the snobbery factor to judge as in the G25 article linked here. Are we dealing with that here?I frequent the ""Toyota on the mend"" thread and all topics are allowed to be discussed over there, I guess that's where I'm coming from. Maybe a different moderator?Freedom of speech is a wonderful thing, something I fought for. "
"shipo","January 2011"," Like it or don't, believe it or not, you have absolutely zero right to ""free speech"" on any and every private forum, this one included. "
"roadburner","January 2011"," Freedom of speech is a wonderful thing, something I fought for. The First Amendment does not apply to private internet forums. Start your own board if you want to discuss anything you like- that's what a bunch of us did almost one decade ago... "
"mz6greyghost","January 2011"," If you can live without the extra options that the 37 offers, then by all means, take the 25. Considering that there's virtually NO difference between the cars besides the badges and the engines (same suspension, brakes, steering, and interior appointments), and driving impressions seem to be positive despite the lower HP, it's a good deal to get into an Infiniti instead of settling for a FWD TSX IMO. "
"Kirstie_H","January 2011"," This is entirely accurate. A simple reading of the Constitution, rather than a re-phrasing of what one believes it to say, will provide illumination. Freedom of speech allows you the liberty to say whatever you want, without at the same time obligating ANYONE to provide you with a venue in which to say it.However, anyone who is truly committed to changing this can take the first step with me - We can drop by your friend's or relative's house (better yet... the boss!), stone drunk, with my accordion, and sit on their porch singing show tunes all night to proclaim our newly-defined right to Freedom of Speech. I joke, but the fact is that our topic-oriented discussions are just that. We allow you to discuss any vehicle-related topic that might be of interest - we just require that you do so in a discussion about that vehicle. New and old members alike should have some reasonable expectation that the majority of conversation centers around the topic in the discussion title, and/or around the vehicles listed in the discussion header. Some of the discussions in Auto News are looser and more fluid. Sedans discussions are vehicle(s)-specific.I have, at least twice, pointed to a perfectly good discussion to talk about the Maxima (plus there are Maxima-specific discussions). No reason that conversation can't be continued there, unless of course there's not enough interest, which would mean there's... just not enough interest in general. It's pretty clear that the Maxima does not, at this time, qualify as an ELLPS.And of course you are perfectly allowed to start your own message board - not every Forum style suits every person, and there is no One True Forum. Lots of people frequent a variety of fora, on a variety of topics. That's cool. Hey, we even started an Off-Topic board a few years ago, recognizing that sometimes people just want to chat about stuff other than cars. I think we've actually become more flexible over the past few years... who'd have thought we'd be swapping recipes, book and movie recommendations, political views, and travel ideas on a car site? "
"savetheland","January 2011"," I considered it too and found out that in real world G37 costs slightly more than G25 (like may 36K vs 33K). Its up to you what do you prefer, but if you are going to shell out 30 grands anyway does couple of grands make any difference? My only problem with G is that it is tight inside and looks cartoonish and misproportioned at the same time. But I am going to compare it to Regal 2.0T anyway. Acura ugliness keeps me away from it. Regal is European car and may be unreliable, thats my concern. What else. Volvo S60 - good reviews but even tighter than G and overpriced and I did not like interior, and not good reliability record either. I commute a lot so miles pile up quickly and if my car keeps breaking down often it is not okay, so CC and A4 go out of window too. Japanese better outsource designs to California studious otherwise there is almost nothing to consider. "
"fedlawman","January 2011"," Wow, there are so many things in your post that I either don't agree with or just don't understand.G is tight inside? You do know this is the ELLPS thread, right? All of these sedans are small. If you need space, you should be shopping in another segment.Regal a European car? Sort of. The Buick Regal is the American version of the Opel Insignia, which is built by Opel, a GM owned company. There are lots of fine ""European"" American cars (Holden Commodore, Ford Mondeo, Vauxhall Monaro, Opel Vectra), but to imply they might be unreliable because they are European is just ridiculous. Volvo S60 small and unreliable? Again, what's all this ""unreliable European car"" talk? I have owned many European cars over the years and didn't find them any more or less reliable than any other car. And how does the S60 have a poor reliability record when this is the first model year? And again, why do you think the S60 is tight? You do know Volvo also has something called the S80 for people who want more space, right?CC and A4 out the window too? Really, I assume they break down too much also?Japanese cars need California design? So, the G37 is ugly and so is the TL and TSX I assume? You do realize that you've eliminated every car in this discussion thread, right? May I suggest you start a new thread entitled, ""ELLPS BRAG"" (Entry-Level Luxury Performance Sedans that are Big Reliable And Good-looking). "
"savetheland","January 2011"," I am sorry but I expressed my opinion, you can disagree with me and be entitled to your own, but I will spend my hard earned money as I find appropriate and will buy whatever fits best my budget, tastes and requirement no matter what other people think about it. "

Never have. Why would I? Just to tell people I don't like trucks? You don't like cars that are small, ugly, and/or European. OK, thanks for visiting. "
"roadburner","January 2011"," Here's what I don't understand. I don't like pickup trucks, so I don't bother visiting any truck forums here. Never have. Why would I? Just to tell people I don't like trucks? I wrote this in another forum with respect to BMWs, but I think it addresses the situation here as well:I have a Jeep TJ and I never post snotty comments on the Hummer or Land Rover boards. My TJ does what I want it to do and I don't need to justify my choice. Ditto for my Mazdaspeed3. I leave the guys in the GTI, MCS, Si, and WRX boards to their own devices. Again, why bother them? And as for my X3 and 3er, I feel no compulsion whatsoever to troll the Audi, Infiniti, Lexus, or MB boards. What's the point? The same goes for my Speed Triple. However, there always seems to be a few non-BMW owners who just have to yell ""Mine's bigger!"" in the Bimmer topics. "
"sweendogy","January 2011"," i'm an owner of a new body g35x (not 37) and at the time they announced the g25 i was excited but since reading the stat lines on the car -mpg, performance, HP, and lack of manual it kind of confuses me a bit- I mean they should of put a turbo 4 in the car with stick 250 hp for that price -- or give it a v4/v6 that gets 30 mpg, for me this is a good looking car-- it turns and breaks well- the base 3 series has more hp and if you can find a base one with a 6speed it sounds like a better deal-- plus with the manual your looking at more power and more fun while in the same price range. i also think the selective editing gets old certainly when good points are being made- like why is the TSX in this category again but the Max is not?? same price range and fwd only difference is Acura vs Nissan nameplate. "
"Kirstie_H","January 2011"," Well, most of the time, we go on manufacturer specification. They call it a midsize sedan? OK, we do too. They call it a large sedan? We do too. I think you might find the conversation in our mainstream large sedans discussion interesting, as the interior measurements of the Maxima are smaller than the Altima. Would love your perspective there. "
"fedlawman","January 2011"," Personally, I think the G25 is being targeted at IS250 buyers - namely, young upwardly mobile females looking to enter the ""luxury"" market. These buyers don't care about HP or manual transmissions. They're looking for styling and amenities.The TSX belongs here because, with the 6MT at least, it is arguably one of the sportiest, most fun-to-drive cars in this category. I actually think it epitomizes the ELLPS segment right now. If you've never driven it, you just cannot imagine how the numbers don't tell the story of how the sum is greater than the parts. I have driven very few cars where every part is in harmony with every other part. The engine, transmission, steering, switchgear, green house - it's just a joy to spend time with. It's not without faults, of course, but they disappear once you're rolling. It's like a symphony - seriously. I'll always remember mine as one of my favorites. "
"saratoga3","January 2011"," i am concerned with the G37 tranny issue, and from what I have been reading the G25 is not having these problems., that's why I was considering the 25. Also, my other option is a CPO G35X, since they don't have the 7 speed tranny. "
"nyccarguy","January 2011"," belongs here despite the fact that it is FWD (or as many call it, Wrong Wheel Drive). I thought the total package was much better overall than the MINI Cooper S (6MT) I test drove before it. I love how the suspension is tuned. I'm a die hard manual transmission guy & actually really like the way our TSX's automatic performs. Upshifts are smooth & crisp. Downshifts come when you want them too. Driving in M mode, the transmission WILL NOT upshift at the redline unless you select the next gear. It is also the most ENTRY LEVEL of the ELLPS. You can seriously own a TSX Tech for under $30K. Nobody else in this segment can touch that price. "
"mz6greyghost","January 2011"," ... the Saab 9-5? Is that considered a ELLPS?Personally, I'm not a big fan of them, but the upcoming 9-5 SportCombi is actually a decent-looking wagon.IMO it's better-looking than the TSX wagon. "
"nyccarguy","January 2011"," one of those bad boys loaded up is well over $50K. That is NOT entry level by any sense of this board. "
"mz6greyghost","January 2011"," What exactly is the price ceiling then?Consider:A BMW 335i xDrive with options exceeds $55K.An Audi A4 can exceed $51K.A C-class (non-AMG) can also exceed $51K.Granted, the base price starts higher than the others (at $38,525, according to their website) but it's relatively well-equipped. "
"moonsky1","January 2011"," To me, the price ceiling would be $45K for a car equipped with typical options and navigation system for a luxury car. You know, leather, moonroof, xenon, heated seats, climate control, upgraded audio, auto-dimming mirrors, power seat and memory, those kind of things. So most Japanese ones qualify even if it's G37 or IS350, but not the German ones because they are too expensive. I would consider 9-5 to be in this segment too. "
"nyccarguy","January 2011"," Also isn't the entry level car in the Saab lineup, that would be the 9-3. I'll have to check, but I think the 9-5 competes with the 5 series & E class. "
"fedlawman","January 2011"," +19-5 is too big and not entry-level. "
"moonsky1","January 2011"," Agree. Didn't know that it's almost as long as a Caravan. (Slight exaggeration, but it's definitely way bigger than any car in this category) "
"sweendogy","January 2011"," carguy and lawman.. the TSX i think its a great car for the money but luxury and performance are key factors to consider-- this is the same car sold overseas as the accord - they put leather and chrome in the car here and call it an acura-- msrp ranges from 30k to 39k (yes for a tsx with nav and a V6) and with deals i'm sure you can get a 6speed manual for around 28k which is a great price for a car like this. I have not driven the new tsx but the last generation with the best manual on the planet was a joy - but performance in the current model do not match prev generations as this car has become a little bloated. The base sonada comes with 200 hp and you can get a 275hp turbo 4 for 25k that gets 33mpg highway- you would love to see acura ""advance"" a bit before the whole line becomes saab or volvo. "
"smarty666","January 2011"," couldn't agree with you more about the TSX and Acura as a whole! I do have to say that of the current Acura line-up, the TSX is the only vehicle I could see getting and the only one that I could tolerate the shield grill on. Let's hope Acura gets rid of that styling choice in the next generations of their vehicles! "
"cdnpinhead","January 2011"," . . .but the last generation with the best manual on the planet was a joy. . .Still is for me -- the TSX manual is really fine. If the car put the power down via the rear wheels and had a 2 or 2.5 litre diesel I'd keep it until they put me in a home.As it is, I still haven't seen anything I like enough better to go for it. A Jetta or Golf TDI are possibilities, but I really enjoy the stone solid reliability of a Honda product.The transmission clicks nicely into each gear and is certainly the best one I've used since my MGB. Even though the B's tansmission lacked a synchronized first gear, the linkage had absolutely zero play in it and sat right on top of the transmission -- good times. The two Miatas and the 240Z I drove many miles had lots of good features, but the transmissions weren't the equal of the TSX or the B. "
"sweendogy","January 2011"," the honda product reliability cant argue with that- and good to hear they didnt fuss with the tranny. Rare manual transmission driver, good job "
"nyccarguy","January 2011"," While the TSX V6 with Tech does go into the far reaches of the upper $30K range, they don't sell well & Acura puts big incentives on them to sell. The majority of TSXs out there are 4cyl. "
"sweendogy","January 2011"," i'm sure thats the case with the 6 --. Acura should invest some money in the line- drop the 6 , clean up the grill, make a coupe?, and throw another 50 plus HP (or more) into a turbo 4, how about a 6speed auto. while keeping weight down..right now its a 4cyl pulling 3500 lbs with just 200hp and 170lbs.. might be nice to sit in but its not a performer in its current form (certainly if ordered with an 5 speed auto). sorry edmunds this current car does not meet ELLPS no matter what acura says on its press releases. "
"fedlawman","January 2011"," It may not be quickest in the 1/4 mile, but the TSX with 4 cylinder engine and 6 speed manual is a delight to drive, and most definitely is an ELLPS. "
"sweendogy","January 2011"," sadly only 5% of the tsx market is sold in 6 speed form. "
"cdnpinhead","January 2011"," if one wants a manual transmission, it's time to go to work. They're rarely stocked, and when they are, they're liable to be loaded with s*** (let's say stuff) that I don't want. When I got mine, I checked inventories all over the West and finally ended up paying the local dimwits to truck one in from Denver that I couldn't see. Once that happens, serious bargaining goes out the window.Either way, I have my manual, and I enjoy it.Point being, if none are available for test drives, most people will give up. The same thing happens with BMW, among others.Chicken & egg. "
"fedlawman","January 2011"," My experience back in 04 was just the opposite.I wanted a 325i and tried to find one with just the sport package and manual transmission and couldn't find anything that wasn't fully loaded.Then, having read the favorable magazine reviews, I test drove the TSX 6MT and that was it - I never looked back. It was so tossable and playful, and had the slickest shifter and sweetest revving engine I had ever experienced - nicer even than the also excellent BMW. Ironically, I was totally satisfied with it until I took it to a couple of BMW club track days (where, BTW, I was able to keep pace with E46 330is and E36 M3's) and decided that I wanted RWD.Except for it being FWD, the TSX has almost the perfect mix of sportiness, luxury, and refinement. It was simply a pleasure to own - and for 90% of drivers (who don't take their cars to lapping days), FWD is no handicap. "
"nyccarguy","January 2011"," Coupes don't sell - That's why Honda KILLED OFF cars like the CL, RSX, & My Beloved Prelude. Another 50 Horsepower (The V6 TSX gets you an additional 80) or a turbo gives you way too much torque to drive the front wheels. The 200 horsepower & 175 lb-ft of torque are perfectly mated to Acura's FWD platform. The numbers don't tell the whole story. "
"mz6greyghost","January 2011"," Another 50 Horsepower (The V6 TSX gets you an additional 80) or a turbo gives you way too much torque to drive the front wheels. The 200 horsepower & 175 lb-ft of torque are perfectly mated to Acura's FWD platform.Maybe you think 250 HP is too much to drive the front wheels, but I beg to differ.I've got 272 HP going to the front wheels of my Mazda6, and it's just right. I've suffered NO torque steer, even when exiting a tight corner. The only tug I've felt with a FWD V6 is with an Altima 3.5SE I tested a few years ago.I've even driven the TSX V6, and felt that the power was nice, with no noticeable torque steer. Can't say that for the 4-cylinder, even with a manual. The power was adequate, but still felt noticeably weaker compared to the G and 3-series, and I wasn't about to drop $36K on a FWD sedan just for the V6 (which IMO is way overpriced just to get a bigger engine). "
"smarty666","January 2011"," The 6-spd is slowly being introduced right now. The ZDX and MDX have it and in a few months, the TL will have it with the 2012 update. I suspect that the TSX will get it in the next year or two. "
"sweendogy","January 2011"," honda didnt kill off the accord and civic coupe....during that time nissan introduced the g35 coupe and now an altima coupe, lexus has the is250C, bmw continues to make a 3, and 6, audi the a5, mbusa yep they have a few as well.. if they sold a tsx-like coupe it would outsell the ZDX and RL combined.. i understand the TSX is a great FWD car, and numbers dont tell the whole story, but the point is they need to step it up a bit. "
"flightnurse","March 2011"," For a Audi Forum I love how the TSX has taken over. I never understood why Acrua thought they needed a V6 in the TSX, never made sense. If they wanted more HP, then take the turbo engine from the RDX and make it a low pressure turbo engine, say in the 220-230 HP range. This would give the TSX more HP without having some of the FWD turbo issues. Add a real sport package to the car 6 spd manual and wham, got yourself a great car.Being back in school for my masters, I needed to lower my monthly payments on my car, so I went with a 2010 Ford Fusion SE with 6 spd manual and the Appearance package (also known as sport package) have to say, its a lot of fun to play with. I got 235/40/HR18 tires, slightly lower suspension, and taunter suspension all for $24K OTD. It has a bigger back seat then the TSX and living here in Phoenix, the last thing I want in the summer time is leather. But I'll be looking for a new 2012 A4 once I'm done with school, the back seat is bigger then the TSX, BMW or C class. "

"carnaught","June 2011"," Although the G37 is more engaging to drive than the ES350, you'll tire quickly of the intrusiveness (loud growl of the engine, etc.) of the Infiniti. Unless you're planning a lease, the relatively poor resale of the Infiniti is also a negative.Personally, I'd go for the BMW. Also, for $h*ts and giggles, drive the VW CC; you might be pleasantly surprised. "

"littlejoe613","June 2011"," You may have to do some more up-to-date research before commenting.......the resonant tailpipe tone on my G37 Coupe is intentional. The resale for my leased G37 is 56 percent which I understand is great for this segment. G37 has more features, is more reliable plus alot less costly to own than Lexus or BMW's. VW CC ? , Come on it isnt even close to an Infiniti in quality. The ES350 is a car for grandpa. The IS350 is actual a better competitor to the 335i, Acura TL and the G37 than the ES350. I laugh everytime one of my buddies takes his BMW in for repairs or maintenance after 50k...Its a joke. Don't take my word for it competitive info is all over the internet and this site. "
"fedlawman","June 2011"," The ""growl"" of the engine in the G37 is different than the resonance from the tailpipe. It's the VQ's unrefined and rough sounding nature at higher revs that makes you think it's going to throw a rod every time you get it above 5000 RPM.BMW's inline 6 is one of the sweetest sounding, smoothest revving engines on the planet, and it's well worth the premium in price to have it. "
"nyccarguy","June 2011"," You know you are getting the BMW kdshapiro! An ES350? "
"sweendogy","June 2011"," unrefined i laugh at that- the engine has been a work horse for nissan for years-has won engine of the year multiple times over (in prev variations) - it throws out 330 hp and gets ok fuel economy. Its not a bmw engine no, but its not unrefined -- drive a base dodge charger and you'll worry about ""throw a rod"" as you try to get on a local on ramp. Infiniti might be louder then BMW but again its different - i think infiniti was going for more of a muscle car sound at open throttle- we all can agree bmw is ahead when it comes to the class but infiniti is not far behind given the price points, the power, the sporty nature and quality. i own a infiniti g35x from 2007, actually looking for bmw 335xi sport 6 speed manual and would not be if infiniti put a 6 speed in awd form.

"kdshapiro","June 2011"," Ya' know, I've been a member of edmunds since 1999.

"m6user","June 2011"," I notice you had the ES350 as a possible but not the 2012 TL. A lot of people are turned off by the styling which started in 2009 and that may be the reason. However, the 2012 has smoothed out lines and a lot better looking grill. It's probably right in between the G and the ES as far as ride/handling goes and gets 20city/29hwy with the new 6spd auto trans on the front wheel drive version which IMO is pretty good for a roomy luxury car. "
"kdshapiro","June 2011"," I am turned off by Acuras' styling direction. Maybe I'll look at the 2012. I am not a fan of the front grille at all. It's way worse than the Bangled up 745s; which I kind of liked, but everybody else hated. "

"carnaught","June 2011"," You may have to do some more up-to-date research before commenting.......the resonant tailpipe tone on my G37 Coupe is intentional. The resale for my leased G37 is 56 percent which I understand is great for this segment. Hmm, I wasn't aware that I had to do ""research"" to your standards in order to comment here. Thanks for the advice but I've done the research....and, I owned a 2009 Infiniti coupe. While reliable, the ""intentional"", as you call it, tailpipe tone was just plain annoying. As for resale, you can quote any number you can dig up but what counts is what a person can actually get for their car in the real world, and it was not great.With 4 BMW's owned, sorry to disappoint you, but they all were stellar in terms of their lack of repair issues. I'll take any of them over the two Infinitis I've owned or the two my son has had.My bringing up the VW CC was mainly in response to KD's mentioning of the Lexus ES350.

"plekto","June 2011"," Well, my computer died yesterday in the middle of my response, so here goes again (holding fingers)...I was in the exact same situation as you about half a year ago. My parents have reached the age where they can get us kids to to the shopping and testing for them.(though we have kids as well - heh). CPO 1-2 years old was also an option. Anyways, the short list was the TSX, the C Class, the CTS, the G37, and the IS250/350.TSX - this came in last place. It suffers from front wheel drive and while it is pretty inside, it still has a noisy engine and a feel to it that is pretty ""normal"". And the looks aren't that great. It has that smiley face look that only the Japanese can pull off. IS250/350 - Had a lot of the same issues as the TSX. Just sort of ""meh"", though a very nice and pretty car overall. But it lacked something identifiable as a soul or a personality. Like going to Cold Stone and getting just vanilla ice cream. Sure, it's superb, but even the most awesome vanilla is still vanilla. The prices of the TSX and IS also seemed a bit inflated. So that left the G37, G8, the C350, and the CTS. The G37 was good, but it really has an odd feel to it - it's a young person's weekend racer in a business suit. It doesn't feel as polished or refined as it should be, and perhaps that's because it is based upon the Z. It also has that dolled-up feel to it. I guess it was sitting in the M next to it that reinforced to me how big of a difference there was between luxury and just looking like it. You''d figure that an auto manufacturer would build a smaller version of its better cars instead of pimping out a lower brand...Great car to drive, though. Just was missing something.... It's kind of how I describe the Volvo S60 and Audi A4 - close but still feels off.It boiled down to two choices that were an absolute tie, the C class and the CTS. The CTS was what they eventually settled upon, but only because of the GM dollars that he had. It is a fantastic car all-around. The car drives great, handles great, and has a very nice interior. It's by far the best thing GM has ever made. My personal favorite, though, was the (new model) C350. It felt just about perfect in how it drove. The interior was also perfect as well - great seats, and you could tell that it was really a smaller version of the E class and S class. I'd rate it as a slightly softer road feel of the 3 series. Both are within a few percent of each other. But the edge for luxury goes to Mercedes. The edge for performance goes to BMW. (note - the new E class sedan is based largely upon the C class - if you want something larger that is) "
"smarty666","June 2011"," Then your not a smart private seller. Who knows what conditions you had your vehicles in. Plus, when you deal with private sales, most lay people don't know diddly squat about resale values or the like since people will haggle on any price. If you didn't like the price they offered you then DON'T SELL IT TO THEM. Having a difficult buyer has nothing to do with the resale value of your Infiniti's, if you had them in excellent condition. A dealership wouldn't think twice of selling a used vehicle to you if they didn't make a profit. Lets just dismiss the cold hard facts that professional sources rate things on. I hope I'm not confusing you with logic and reason :confuse: "
"tlong","June 2011"," Plekto,Your story is interesting, thanks for that. This is exactly the market segment that I am interested in. I had a '98 A4, and I'm currently driving an '05 TL. If I were to replace that car today, a lot of the vehicles that you listed would be on my list. My thoughts:IS - don't particularly like Lexus or Toyota, this one is outTSX - I really liked the previous model, I sort of agree on the current one. Not as attractive, gotten too big, too soft and bloated. But a good value choice.A4 - is now too expensive. No 6 cyl choice.BMW - The 3 series is close, but BMW's have never quite done it for me. I guess I want a little higher mix of luxury and a bit more reasonable purchase price.CTS - I don't mind the looks, I'll take your word on the interior. I'm just not quite ready to buy GM - need to see longer term reliability and survivability of the company.S60 - I really like the looks, although I haven't sat in it or driven it. I'm shocked at how much it costs. Also not sure how the ownership changes of Volvo might affect things long term.C-class - too expensive. Also not sure I'm ready to have the MB stigma (how it looks to others). But given that, I think the C-class is BY FAR the most attractive car in the class. Given your comments on the interior, I have no doubt that this would be good as well. I think I'd consider getting a 2-3 yo one coming off a lease to save some money. And I think this is the one I'd eventually go to if I was going to leave my TL. It would have to be worth it, and the other cars on the list just aren't quite appealing enough at this time. "
"kdshapiro","June 2011"," Pletko, replying to you but a general reply to the board.I decided on the g37 and it is now in my possession. White, wheat interior, accents, nav, premium plus other stuff. I sent the sales rep an offer within email after doing my homework. In the end the offer was accepted without negotiation on the dealers part.Process was as painless as can humanly be. I'm pleased with the car. "
"nyccarguy","June 2011"," Nice - you're going to be happy "
"plekto","June 2011"," I personally like the G37 the most out of that list, but it's because I could in theory get it with manual and I kind of like muscle cars. It's definitely not a proper luxury sedan, though.But for the price, it is also a good deal - at the end of the year, with incentives, we're talking about 3-4K more than an Accord V6 or Camry V6, and about the same price as a TSX. As an upscale family sedan, it is a fantastic alternative. ***As for the original poster's comments, yes, it took me a long time to get over the whole Mercedes stigma as well when I first owned one years ago. They are fine cars and if it's any consolation to you, they carry a bit less stigma now than a typical BMW does. At least around here. The C 300 Luxury is probably the best compromise, though, since the sport is nice and all, but the interior of the Luxury is by far better. Just two things, though - one, you absolutely do want to add the rear spoiler to it as it makes the back end look more defined. And the panoramic sunroof is awesome looking with the Sandstone Beige. (it's tinted very dark black so it adds nice contrast) It's really the only color combo that the car looks best in, IMO, and I generally hate beige and tan colors. 35K all over town, so CPO at 25-30K is a snap.

They dropped the base model as well and now relegate that to the G25 where it belongs. The G37 starts out at the mid level trim. Most of the options aren't really required, either, and the car rides far too hard with the sport tires or sport package. Hence why, IMO, it's not a real luxury car - though it is a good upscale sport sedan like the 3 series.Truecar has one for $32320 near me. And it's not the end of the year - there's no incentives going on right now. It's $27K even for a Camry V6 XLE (no options, either) - no incentives, ever. Like I said - it's a fantastic deal and a better replacement for the tired and boring Camry in any case. For 4-5K more, it's a no-brainer, really. It represents what I feel is the best value for the dollar currently on the market. And for 90% of people who have never had either a proper luxury car or a proper sports car, it's going to feel like they won the lottery compared to their old car.But for the original poster, it's not quite what he seems to want - he wants a step up from all of that.

"plekto","June 2011"," Well, if you don't put winter tires on the car, it will handle like junk no matter what it is. And the thing normally comes with summer tires which exacerbates the issue.http://editorial.autos.msn.com/listarticle.aspx?cp-documentid=1168211They say that less than 3% of U.S. tire sales are for winter tires. They tested a G37 with and without and the findings are surprising if you aren't familiar with these types of tires.Quote (MSN Autos):What About All-Wheel Drive?Often cited as the transportation cure for winter climates, all-wheel drive is far from a silver bullet. In previous tests, we've discovered that an all-wheel-drive vehicle with all-season tires can outaccelerate either a front- or rear-driver on winter rubber, but that's where the advantage ends. The additional traction of winter tires allows a two-wheel-drive car to outbrake, outturn, and generally outmaneuver its all-wheel-drive brethren. Of course, the unstoppable winter option that can impart visions of rally-driving heroism is the combination of all-wheel drive and winter tires, but possessing all-wheel drive generally sacrifices a rear-drive car's handling balance in the dry, adds a couple hundred pounds, and comes with a fuel-economy penalty. That's why our preferred choice is to buy a second set of tires to get through the winterHere's a video of all season vs winter tires:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlYEMH10Z4sSo you should forget AWD and get a set of summer and a set of winter tires instead. If you live where you really get bad snow, that is. "
"gooddeal2","June 2011"," Yeb, I hardly find just a RWD here unless I want a MT. 99.9% of the Gs are AWD in Philly. "
"kdshapiro","June 2011"," I have plenty of snow experience. The awd on my subie worked flawlessly with all season tires in two feet of snow from the last few winters.I don't want to turn this into a debate on drivetrains and tires. But in the northeast there are a lot of cars on the road with awd.It easy to sit in LA and link to articles on tires and drivetrains. Why dont you spend a winter or ten in the northeast and get some practical experience with tires and drivetrains? "
"Kirstie_H","June 2011"," Heck, even going to Kansas City would do. Two winters with 40+ inches of snow each year switched me to 4WD in a heartbeat. No regrets. While it's all well and fine for people to keep giving ideas about how to turn a RWD sport sedan into a decent snow performer with better tires, etc., I can tell you that my 4WD vehicle outperforms my G35 in the snow, period. "
"plekto","June 2011"," Yet, you don't hear about people in Europe having problems with RWD Mercedes and BMWs being dangerous in the winter, do you? Winter tires are considered a normal thing in Germany and everyone uses them.It's really not the huge issue that most people on the boards here make it out to be. The way that people talk about it seems as if your car will instantly fly off the road, cash, and explode if you don't cough up the extra thousands for an AWD system.Proper tires and not driving like a moron can make it pretty much a non-issue and allow you to consider pretty much any car or truck for winter use. That video, btw, that I linked to was of a RWD BMW. Oh, and we do get snow in California. I didn't always live in So. Cal - there's tons of bad weather up in the northern parts of the state. And in all of that time, I never once considered what type of drive (FWD/RWD/4WD) the vehicle had when I purchased it. I adjusted my driving patterns and tires to fit the situation. "
"Kirstie_H","June 2011"," I didn't pay thousands extra for my AWD vehicle, and I didn't see anyone allude that your RWD will fly instantly off the road. Just that AWD performs better. Ever live in Europe? I'm guessing not. I have. It's a bit silly to lump all of Europe into a single category, because some areas get almost no snow, but anyway... not everyone in Germany drives a RWD vehicle, and I'm not sure it would make international news if some of those who did had trouble in the snow. I will say that much of England pretty much shuts down if there's 2"" of snow - could we attribute that to the prevalence of RWD vehicles in Europe? I doubt it, but that debate point makes as much sense as your point about ""not hearing about BMWs/Mercedes flying off the road in Germany.""As I said, talk all you want. We've had two RWD vehicles at the same time in winter, and 2 AWD vehicles at that same time. I'm going to choose the AWD vehicle in heavy snow 100% of the time, even if you tell me yet another time how RWD is a non-issue if you have proper tires and driving skills. "
"plekto","June 2011"," Well, there are a couple of factors to condsider with AWD. Does it actually work? Most systems actually are only good for slow speeds and getting you unstuck from snow and the like. If the system transfers power back and forth and isn't engaged all of the time, it's useless for most bad conditions unless the power ratios are set up correctly. Most manufacturers get this horribly wrong. The G37 in question costs $1500 more for the AWD version, but it performs almost the same as the RWD version due to the power distribution. (0/100 under default conditions). It's basically fancy version of stability control in that it kicks in when it feels that it needs to, and from videos of the system in action that I have seen, it takes about 1/4 to 1/2 of a second for the computer's AI to actually think and respond.(not talking about theoretical published specs, but watching the wheels respond to an unknown surface and how they move back and forth)Too slow to be useful at normal driving speeds except to maybe lessen a skid or situation where you are already in over your head. There are numerous articles and videos out there about half-baked AWD systems, so I'll not go into this further.The other issue is cost - $1500 more and much more likely to break down as the car ages. Is it worth it? Probably not. It's certainly not full-time AWD like Audi and Subaru use. "
"kdshapiro","June 2011"," The G37 in question costs $1500 more for the AWD version, but it performs almost the same as the RWD version due to the power distributionIt may perform the same but I'll bet it doesn't react the same. What I want out of my AWD system is not to have to worry about powering through deep drifts. I want to be able to step on the gas gently and have all four tires partipate in gingerly moving the car without throwing it into a skid.With RWD with snows, gingerly is not in the equation. It doesn't matter whose system is better, I want the system to be just good enough so I won't get stuck.The ATTESA has been written up for the last several years as the best performance AWD.Come this winter I will find out. "
"tlong","June 2011"," Don't forget that AWD doesn't do anything for braking. It can get you moving in slick conditions, but to get stopped - well all cars brake on all four wheels. "
"m6user","June 2011"," I'll be sure to tell the tow truck driver pulling me out of a snow drift that he really doesn't need 4WD on his truck.....just get some snow tires.  "
"tlong","June 2011"," Don't see how your comment is relevant to my comment. :surprise: "
"plekto","June 2011"," Yeah.. as I've said numerous times before if you are THAT concerned with snow, just get 4x4 as it actually does work like it should. I can guarantee that my friend's 4Runner will outperform almost any AWD system on almost any surface.But of course, it's big, expensive, and eats lots of gas and all of that... And you can't use the 4x4 mode on pavement. Then again, you really don't NEED to given how well it drives. "
"ivan_99","June 2011"," I vote for a boat-car...imagine the possibilities.Plus safety... "
"plekto","June 2011"," Heh.Of course, I was being a little bit sarcastic there. :P But I think I also have a valid point in that if you are looking for a ""luxury performance sedan"", AWD is a minor concern compared to all of the other factors. Because the fact is that most of them will be RWD or heavily RWD biased anyways. You will need winter tires if you want to drive it during the winter months.It just makes more sense to spend the extra $1500 on a second set of rims and winter tires and just swap them every 6 months or so. "
"kdshapiro","June 2011"," None of these cars are being raced at nascar. Even the 750 comes with awd these days.Meh I would rather go for the awd instead of a second set of rims. Awd is more useful in more situations than two plus snows.10 years I probably would have been preaching being a purist. Now I just want to enjoy my ride and I don't care if I'm getting the last ounce of performance from it. Or if the awd system is front biased, rear biased, full time or part time. I just don't want to get stuck.As an aside 4 snow tires on an awd car can out everything a rwd car in slick conditions. "
"nyccarguy","June 2011"," I'm with you regarding AWD. I've seen all the tests & read all the arguments. I know that a RWD car equipped with snow tires & all of today's electronic nannies will be lighter and therefore brake better & outmaneuver the exact same car with all season tires & AWD. 2 of my 3 cars ('01 Prelude & '10 TSX) are FWD and I equip them with 4 snow tires during the winter months. Do the snow tires provide phenomenal grip & awesome traction in the white stuff? Absolutely. Are they perfect? No.Changing over isn't that simple, nor is it cheap. My Prelude has a dedicated set of 15"" steel wheels which the snow tires are mounted on. I store them where I work and have the changeover done by a ""Fix-A-Flat"" place up the block. They charge me $30 each time I changeover. I didn't buy an extra set of wheels for my TSX, just a set of snow tires. I have to jam 3 tires into the trunk and put one in the front seat. My Acura dealer charges $100 for a snow tire changeover that includes dismounting, remounting, & balancing.They don't plow particularly well where I live in Stamford, CT (10 miles from the NY State border), nor do they salt due to the high concentration of well water. This past winter was particularly bad, but I can see how AWD can and will be useful in the future.Every BMW & Mercedes-Benz that's not an ///M (besides the X5 M & X6 M) or AMG, 6, Z4, SL, or SLK is All Wheel Drive that I see in NY & CT.Besides, my mere average driving skills won't let me squeeze the all out performance out of a RWD, SP Equipped BMW anyway.

I'd probably be driving a TL Type S today if the rear seats folded down, which they don't. As a result, I have an '08 TSX that I really like, except for the fact that the wrong pair of wheels is being driven, which brings us to . . .The G35. I've had great luck with Nissan over the decades, and lots of people enjoy the G series. Rear-wheel-drive has a number of advantages in a performance-oriented car, but the engine in this guy is the same one they use across the board, from the Pathfinder to the Z-car. It's a bit thirsty and noisy I'm told, but solid as a rock. Our '04 Pathfinder has over 106K miles on it and has had absolutely no issues at all beyond a couple of little things related to the parking brake.Enjoy your search.

They're kind of rare around here.Mustang - less refined, which can be good or bad. Not so sure about long term reliability.Accord - probably very reliableInfiniti - sporty, narrower interior, powerful but growlier engine. Should be reliable.Altima - no experience, probably a good car, but maybe cheaper interior? "
"fedlawman","August 2011"," You can't go wrong with any of them. Get the one that you like best. "
"Kirstie_H","August 2011"," I tend to agree - the RWD options are going to offer a different driving experience, so you'd have to test drive a few to see if it's for you. In fact, they're all quite different, but there's not a ""bad"" choice on the list. "
"2233","August 2011"," I currently drive a 04 Infiniti G35 AWD and my wife drives an 07 G 35 AWD. Both are great cars. They handle very well on dry, wet and snow pavements. My daughter owns a 09 Accord and I would also rate that highly. My other daughter drives 2010 Altima, 4 cylinder. Both are very reliable and handle well for front drive vehicles. Neither handle as well as the G35s.I've owned a TL and an MDX in the past and had transmission problems with both. Acura still has many transmission issues. They are front wheel drive and while not as bad as some FWDs, they handle a bit jittery. You can't beat rear wheel drive cars like the G35s. The Gs only revert to all wheel drive when it detects slippage.The Maxima is a nice car but is front wheel and also is a bit jittery in the handling dept. Very reliable.I would rate the cars you listed in this order: the G 35, the Altima, the Accord, the Maxima and the Acura TL dead last. "
"plekto","August 2011"," I'd add another one to the short list - a Holden Commodore (Pontiac G8).Great car. Basically a working man's CTS without the bling and silly styling. Since GM ditched Pontiac (since the car is still made in Australia, repairs aren't an actual problem). I'd say a used CTS as well, but there's no point in getting a used CTS when the Pontiac is almost the same thing. "
"Kirstie_H","August 2011"," I had the RWD-only version of the G35. While I rate it among the best vehicles I've ever owned ($0 in repairs, only regular maintenance til it was totaled at 108K miles), the RWD version was about the worst vehicle I've ever owned for anything but a dry day. I'd only recommend it for heavy snow areas if the owner were driving mostly on major roads, and/or had a great set of snow tires. "
"rayainsw","August 2011"," As a G8 GT driver [ 2009 - over 40,000 miles, so far ] and having driven a number of CTS sedans [ including a couple of CTS-v sedans ] I see the G8 as lacking much of the &#145;luxury&#146; aspect I think most people expect in this class. The CTS has a more luxurious interior than any G8. And more luxury-oriented options [ in-dash navigation, for example ] are available on the CTS.Comparing the G8 GT&#146;s power and acceleration and handling - the &#145;performance&#146; aspect of this class, the G8 GT is far superior to any [non &#145;v&#146; ] CTS that I have driven.YMMV.- RaySeduced by power and torque, once again . . . "
"plekto","August 2011"," The original poster did have the Mustang and the Accord v6 in his list, though, so I think the car is fair to add to the list. And it's certainly a very good vehicle. I drove a G37 and this just a day apart and the G8 was simply a better vehicle all-around. Much better though out and just more solid.Comparing the G8 to the Mustang, as much as I love the new Mustang, the G8 is far superior. "
"pr2az","August 2011"," Considering and comparing 2012 TL, C300 and G37X. Based on performance and reliability what are the general impressions and thoughts. Should we be considering another vehicle as well? This would probably be a lease. "
"carnaught","August 2011"," How 'bout the 3-Series BMW? "
"2233","August 2011"," The run flat tires are a deal breaker for me. I recently drove the 328xi and the X3. Both were very nice. Most posters say the run flats are loud, expensive, and do not handle as well as non run flats. Most dealerships and tire stores do not stock run flats. If you get a flat tire, you can drive it 100 or so miles but it then must be replaced, not repaired. If you are several hundred miles from home, especially on a weekend, you will be stranded for up to 3 days waiting for the expensive tire to arrive at the dealer or tire store. You can change the tires to non run flats, but the storing of a spare could be problematic since no space is alloted for a spare.I would rate the G37 first of the ones you mentioned. Great handling, good looking, and very reliable. The TL would be the last vehicle I'd buy. I've owned 2 Acuras but never again. The C class is nice but reliabilty problems are a concern. "
"qbrozen","August 2011"," I like the G37X, but the horrible mileage is tough to live with. My G35X could never get above 21mpg. I'm curious, though, why the G37X vs the C300? A closer comparison would be the G25 vs C300 or C350 vs G37. Personally, if AWD is a must, I'd be looking at the S60, too.No big, heavy FWD sedans for me. "
"carnaught","August 2011"," Infinitis are what your say, and I would add so-so gas mileage and loud engine (""exhaust note"") from a start, to the point of being intrusive.....still overall not a bad choice If I were to acquire a new or late model Infiniti, I'd lease rather than buy though. "
"nyccarguy","August 2011"," It all depends on your driving style & what is important to you (performance, style, interior comfort, features, trunk space, rear passenger space, driving dynamics...). Especially if you are leasing, all the cars you mentioned will be covered by their respective factory warranties for the duration of your lease (& probably beyond). Reliability should pretty much a non-issue.Mercedes has been running some insanely cheap lease deals lately. Especially on leftover 2011 C300 4Matics (the most popular C around here).I'm a pretty big fan of Hondas. We own 3. Yes the TL is nose heavy & is front wheel drive, but Acuras drive pretty nice. They are ""sporty."" They are far from floaty, but very comfortable. Interior appointments are fantastic, it offers generous front & rear accomodations, a decent sized trunk, lots of tech for the dollar. Im curious as to why the OP is checking out the G37 as opposed to the G25 as well. The G37X is a bonafide road rocket. You get 326 hp and a proper RWD chassis. Even though the X denotes AWD, it is still RWD most of the time. Infiniti has some seriously good factory backed leasing. Coupled with a $1000 dealer incentive (not customer incentive) & 2% holdback, you can lease one very cheap. How good is the G37X? I'm trying to convince my wife that we should dump our perfectly good 2010 TSX (bought 8/29/09) with 39K miles and 3 years left to payoff so I can lease the G37X & save $100 a month as opposed to driving the TSX until the wheels fall off.Definitely check out the BMW 328i. The 3 series is a fantastic driver's car. Very sharp reflexes. Excellent driving dynamics. It is a little tight in the back seat & the trunk is tiny too.Good luck & keep us posted with what you get. "
"2233","August 2011"," I would agree that the mileage on the G 37 is not great but you are driving a forced induction muscle car of sorts. On the expressway, I get 23 mpg.We have a 04 G35X and a 07 G35X. The exhaust on the 2004 is definitely loud but I hardly notice the exhaust on the newer 2007. I notice the exhaust more now that I replaced the tires with Michelins on the 04. There is a clear difference in the newer Gs re the exhaust sound. You may not even notice the exhaust on the new Gs. I will probably buy an EX35 soon. I want something small with folding seats. Some consider this a G37 with a little more storage. The EX is something to consider even though it is technically not a sedan but the smallest crossover on the market. Infiniti has some nice incentives now. "
"qbrozen","August 2011"," it is not forced induction, FYI. Forced induction means supercharger or turbocharger, of which the G37 has neither. "
"2233","August 2011"," You are correct. I misspoke re the forced induction. I've read numerous posts re forced induction mods on the G. I guess I meant to say that the G is a beast even without forced induction which several competitors use such as the BMW 335. "
"shabadoo25","August 2011"," Not driving a 3 series because of the tires is ludicrous. Get an 08 or 09 335i. "
"2233","August 2011"," The abilities and liabilities of the tires are pretty important to most. There is no room for a spare in the X3 if you switch out the tires to non run flats. The interior of the current 3 series is very dated but the X3 interior is a huge improvement.There are many posters on the BMW sites that do not care for the run flats, although some do like the fact that they generally won't have to change a flat tire. Getting stranded if you are out of state is a big concern in addition to the noise and poorer handling.That being said, I love the handling of the current 3 series. I actually considered the E91 until I saw the interior. It also has run flats. "
"fedlawman","August 2011"," I totally understand about those BMW run-flats. All the German companies are ruining their cars...I was all set to get a Porsche 911 until I noticed that the passenger side windshield wiper arm was an inch too short.  "
"fedlawman","August 2011"," You do realize that there are these places called ""tire stores?"" "
"nyccarguy","August 2011"," Hey fedlawman! Good to see you are still around my friend. "
"2233","August 2011"," I checked several national tire stores in my area and none stock the runflats. According to several posters on the BMW sites, most dealerships do not stock them.So if you don't travel out of state you're ok with the run flats.I guess you didn't do your homework researching this. Please go ahead and buy a car with run flats. Take some reading material with you if you go out of state because you may get stranded. "
"fedlawman","August 2011"," Who said anything about buying run-flats?Replace the run-flats with a proper set of Michelin Pilot Sports.Buy a donut spare or a can of fix-a-flat for the trunk. "
"fedlawman","August 2011"," You too NYC! By the way, don't get the G - too much of a lateral move from the Acura, IMHO :blush: "
"ivan_99","August 2011"," Me too...what's up with the Germans...I was all ready to sign for my new 911 and they didn't have a license plate holder...I turned around and walked out. "
"2233","August 2011"," I may have mistakenly thought you were advocating run flats.Another poster implied that German car companies other than BMW use run flats often. In fact, few other than BMW use only run flats. Porsche had them years ago on the 959. This site has arguments both ways for the run flats but the majority of these owners are against the use of them http://news.consumerreports.org/cars/2007/06/run-flat-tires-.htmlI considered taking the run flats off a new X3 if I purchased one but there is no convenient place for the spare except taking up space in the smallish space behind the rear seat.They are loud, do not handle as well in the opinion of many, cost almost double, do not last as long and if is difficult to find them in stock.Car makers should make the run flats optional.I like the G37 of all the fine cars mentioned here. It's probably the least expensive, has the great VQ engine, is good looking, handles well, is reliable, and is rear wheel drive (or all wheel drive). The ride of the TL is a different type of ride which I do not like. I've owned several Acuras but will never even consider these again due to their ongoing transmission issues.My second choice would be a current 3 series but I would ditch the run flats as soon as they wear out.....probably around 15,000. I'd replace them with Michelins. The donut spare could fit in the trunk. "
"2233","August 2011"," Your Porsche ""analogy"" is weak and poorly researched.None of the current Porsches come with run flat tires. I wonder why this German company stopped using them? "
"carnaught","August 2011"," My run-flats were still going strong when I traded the car in with 36,000+ mi. on them. Although I would have preferred go-flats instead, I was appreciative of having them when I got a flat and could drive to a Discount Tire to have it repaired. Yes, I know they are not always reparable. "
"fedlawman","August 2011"," Sorry, it's not that my research was poor, it's that you aren't following my logic. Here, I'll spell it out...Rejecting a BMW because you don't like the tires is akin to rejecting a Porsche because the windows aren't tinted dark enough. And while it's true Porsche's don't have run-flats, it's also true that 911's (and Boxsters & Caymans) don't come with a spare tire. Off topic, but I thought you should know that there are 100's of thousands of drivers buying cars in North America without a spare tire (no, not just Porsche's - Chevy does it too). "
"nyccarguy","August 2011"," Fedlawman - don't know if ya heard, but the TSX is now my daily driver. I inherited it from my wife who is now pregnant with #3, who will be daughter #1. I bought her a Pilot, I drive the TSX to work 5 days a week & the Prelude 1 day a week.Lateral? Ya think? 326 hp in my dd would be nice, but I have trouble keeping my two 200 horsepower 4cyl cars under 90;) "
"fedlawman","August 2011"," #3! Wow, you've been busy! Cold winter?Well, of course it's not lateral in terms of HP, but in terms of refinement, balance, and poise, it certainly is (arguably a step down).Of course, HP was never my first priority anyways - I mean, I do drive a 4-cylinder too... On the other hand, the TSX and Prelude are kissing cousins. Maybe you're looking for something completely different? I can understand that.Well, good luck with whatever you decide to do. I've pretty much decided that my next car will be a 911. Just waiting for the right time and car to come along. "
"kyfdx","August 2011"," Can I have that crappy 4-banger, when you get the 911? "
"fedlawman","August 2011","  "
"2233","August 2011"," I understood your logic sir but I guess I consider the qualities of tires way more important than license plates, tinting, or a windshield wiper.I never had a car with run flats and I don't think I ever will until there are substantial improvements in them.Some people really like them so that's what is nice about these forums. Everyone can list the pros and cons and one can make their own decision. "
"plekto","August 2011"," The interesting thing is that these cars are in the same list.One is a large front wheel drive sofa on wheels that is trying to be a better Buick (and largely succeeding as well, I have to admit)One is a small luxury sedan that's extremely understated. A sleeper designed for people who really don't want to show off their money.One is a blinged-out rear wheel drive muscle car. A luxury 370Z to be exact.They all are great vehicles by themselves, but they also are completely different at heart. Honestly I need more information from the original poster because as it is, there is no real connection between the three besides price. Do you want luxury and refinement? Speed and power? A mix of the two? Do you want manual? What about size and weight?For example, if you wanted a luxury barge, then you should be looking at the TL, something from Lexus, or possibly a larger Buick or Cadillac. There's nothing wrong with wanting that (my current car is one - I hate small cars in Los Angeles traffic)If you want smaller and sporty, the G37, the CTS, and the 3 series all come to mind as top choices.If you want refined luxury, the Mercedes, Audi, and the Lexus IS(or possibly the GS) are top choices. "
"Kirstie_H","August 2011"," There are discussions about RFTs and non-RFTs all over the place in the forums. This isn't one of them. Let's not get too sidetracked on this conversation. A little bit, when relevant, is fine, but let's keep the focus on the cars that are on-topic here. "
"wireless","August 2011"," Just ordered a 2012 C-350...IS - The Toyota driving experience is just really bad for me. Terribly numb, bloaty, wallowey. Haven't driven an IS but the styling, like most Japanese cars is derivative. It yells ""Me too."" I understand it will be sporty but the Toyota roots are there. I've owned two Toyotas. Will not buy a third.TSX - Wow where did Acura take such a wrong turn with styling? Just uncomfortable to look at. Nutty smiley face and weird rear end. What are they thinking? Cringeworthy. Acura never was that great at style. They've completely gone off the deep end. And Honda used be run by the engineers. Too bad.A4 - good car and I could get a huge discount, better than employee's due the company I work for. Wanted to love this car. Thought it would be the one. Even got the discount all lined up. Interior has slipped a bit for Audi. Good car, but not much of an upgrade over the Passat I have. Actually like the Passat more - inside and out. The Audi has a couple of cool features, best styling but driving it just didn't do anything for us. Also I've heard a lot about the repairs especially the turbo, e.g,, ""cripplingly expensive."" BMW - We drove the 330 and just don't get it. Distinctly downscale interior, drove fairly well. Honestly on this one I'll take a mulligan. I will allow that it is probably a great car, it wouldn't get all the accolades otherwise. For now neither my wife nor I get it. Just at a loss on this one.CTS - Looks ok. Interior good. Doesn't get good reviews. Just don't trust this car to be reliable, and stand the test of time in styling.S60 - I would be interested in a Volvo before Ford bought them. Now just like Jag, and the other PAG cars they have Ford parts running through them. Platforms, switchgear, engines. Like Saab and GM. You're buying a lot of Ford at an Volvo price. I like Ford... but at Ford prices. Also heard resale is bad as well as reliability. C-class - we ordered the C-350. Drove this vehicle and within literally seconds I knew it was something different. Easily the best car I've ever driven. In every way, the sounds it makes, the way it feels, the way it takes corners, everything felt perfect. My wife felt the same way. Way better than the Audi or Bimmer. I know it sounds implausible but it the difference is stark. The price is on up there but I'm at a stage in my life where I can swing it. We even drove the E-class but since my wife will be the primary driver, the C is best for her, easy to handle and toss around, more fun to drive, etc. Only concern is the German electronics after 5 or 10 years. "
"qbrozen","August 2011"," BMW 330: did you drive a used one? Cause the 330 isn't made anymore.S60: ford parts? I don't know who told you that, but it is not true. The only thing ford/Volvo shared were basic platforms, and even those were not ""ford products"" since they were jointly developed. There are no shared engines at all. Volvo always continued making their cars in Sweden with their own engineering. Under their new Chinese owners, that continues to be the case for now, too. "
"wireless","August 2011"," The Bimmer was a 328. Still same impressions apply.As far as the Volvo goes: trim pieces, steering wheel, tires, wheels, seats, some emissions parts, etc. The may not be interchangeable but the same company makes parts for both. And while I agree that much may be substantially different, one cheap turn signal stalk is a real turn off. Resale value is said to be terrible, so used are a great deal. "
"carnaught","August 2011"," Are there any changes to the 2012 C350? "
"wireless","August 2011"," Yes, quite a few. MB say over 2000 changes. Big changes are the engine 268 hp to 302, direct injection, 10% better gas mileage, the interior was substantially upgraded, one review said it is better than the E class now. Just do a little research and you'll see the reviews. I haven't seen it in person yet. We drove the 2011. The 2011 wasn't bad but they say the '12 is a lot better. Read the Car and Driver review for more info. "
"plekto","August 2011"," I've been impressed by Mercedes as of late. Usually you had to get the S to get the top end engineering and reliability. And they were and still are incredible cars. The C class feels like a half-sized S class. And the difference is more stark if you just do something as simple as let a new TSX and a C idle next to each other. One sounds like it is made out of tin cans by comparison. Now, the Honda *is* a great engine, but it lacks that polished sound and feel that you'd get in, say, a Porsche or other high end car. It's exactly like thinking that your American made Fender Stratocaster is a great guitar (which it is) and then getting your hands on a true custom guitar. The goalposts simply moved without you realizing it, and now you're a bit ruined in your expectations. For the price, especially with year-end rebates, the C is becoming a very good deal.The other car that impresses me is the CTS. Reliability is excellent as far as I can tell, aside from the yahoos who break their CTS-V models' engines and rear diffs and then blame it on the manufacturer. My father has one and it sounds and drives 2-3 times better than any other GM car that he's ever had or driven.The IS and TSX and the rest simply feel dated. "
"carnaught","August 2011"," Sounds like a nice car. Is the body changed for 2012? Was it custom ordered? When do you get it? "
"wireless","August 2011"," Every piece of plastic was changed on the C-class. :]I ordered it with what I wanted. Not many options actually. The C-350 is pretty loaded to start with. I added keylessGO and 18"" AMG Rims. It's supposed to start production in the first ""decade"" (10 days) of October and be delivered in early November. "
"flightnurse","September 2011"," Not too sure why you drove a 328i and a C350, since they aren't comparable. YOu needed to drive the 335i since it makes the came HP as the C350, but the 335i is much faster, handles and is a better car overall then the C350.You stated the A4 interior has slipped, how so? Since all mag's have ranked the interior of the A4 has best in class for the last 5 years, the fit and finish is above that of BMW and MB.I almost got a A4 but the BMW made a much better deal for me, so I bought a 2011 BMW 328i with6spd manuelvalue packageLe Mans Blue MetalicChest Nut Brown leatherM sport package (it comes with the color)Moon roofXenon headlightsComfort Access keyless entrypaid $39K out the door.I looked at MB, but the price for a C300 but MG does not offer a sport package (one os standard on the C300 but its only an apparence package) on its entry level C class. Plus the local MB dealer wasn't really dealing, which wasn't a smarl move since the 2012 is a new C class.I'm very happy with my car, it handles well, its comfortable, and I love the manuel in the car. My next BMW will be a used 335d, I can't justify the price of a new one. "
"nyccarguy","September 2011"," Awesome that you bought a 328i with a stick & sports Pkg! Enjoy! You had to special order that car, right? "
"nyccarguy","September 2011"," There has been some discussion about the value of the scheduled maintenance. While it is built into the price of the car and we all know it isn't free, it is worth something.My 2010 TSX is 2 years old and has almost 40,000 miles. While I don't have all the paperwork in front of me, here's what I've done from memory:Synthetic Oil changes at 5K, 10K, 20K, 30K, & (almost) 40K @ $70 a piece at the dealership.Tire Rotations at the same intervals @ $30 a pieceI had to have the rear brake pads replaced & the front rotors resurfaced & cut.I just had the air filter & cabin filter changed @ $149. "
"plekto","September 2011"," Well, this is kind of to be expected since it is the new Accord, after all.Yes, there is no TSX in Japan. It's sold as the Accord over there. They ship the same car over here and slap an Acura badge on it and add a lot of markup.What we get as the ""Accord"" over here is actually an in-between model that they've never sold in the U.S. before. It's called the Inspire in Japan.It's also why the TSX simply doesn't belong in this discussion, as well. It's kind of like how Cadillac tried to push the Catera as a luxury car years ago when it really was a compact commuter box with some bling and badges added. "
"ivan_99","September 2011"," Agree with everything you've said. I think we can create an entire thread to this one discussion ""What is an Entry Level Performance Sedan"".For those of us that like to argue in circles...We could easily argue why Kia and VW should be 'ahead' of many of these.Of course this always touches on raw emotions...your car is not good enough...it's a chick car...which borders on 'mother' comments  "
"nyccarguy","September 2011"," I actually drove a loaded V6 Accord back to back with the ""same car over here with an Acura badge on it.""Their price tags were remarkably similar. I know underneath my TSX sits on the Accord platform and is sold in Europe as an Accord.Besides the V6 Accord's extra ""punch,"" I prefered everything about the TSX. The suspension tuning is sportier on the TSX. My TSX has thicker anti-roll bars. The seats are comfortable and very thickly bolstered. It drives like a 4 door version of my 2001 Honda Prelude Type SH. For a FWD platform, they did a damn good job. Is it a 3 series? No? Did I like it better than the A4 2.0T w/ Quattro I drove? Yes. Does it belong in this discussion? Absolutely. "
"billyperksii","September 2011"," I love Acuras/Hondas but the TSX is not Entry Level Luxury, it sits between everyday family sedan (accords, camrys) and the entry level luxury (TL, A4 3series)- not quite there yet. "
"m6user","September 2011"," You could say the same thing about the 3 series. Leather is optional on the 3 as well as many things that are standard on the TSX. Acura is a luxury brand. TSX is the entry level car at Acura. What part of ""entry level"" is so hard to understand. The TSX fits the definition perfectly. The G25 is the entry level at Infinti and the A4 at Audi. HP is about the same as as well and without turbocharging. The Skyline is a family sedan in Japan but the same car here is a luxury sport sedan, G37. I don't think anyone argues that the G series is not an entry level luxury sedan. "
"wireless","September 2011"," Price-wise the 328 you bought and the c350 are comparable. If you can't drive a 2011 off the lot for under $40k right now you need to go to another dealer. But yeah, some MB dealers don't deal much. They just don't need to. But the engine while nice wasn't what sold me. It's for my wife so it is not much about the engine.  We like everything else. I sort of understand the Bimmer, it's kind of glued to the ground but it just felt heavier where the MB felt spry, light on it's feet, but very direct-able and responsive. The Bimmer didn't fell any faster and I drove it fast on traffic circles, etc.  The BMW interior was just not good at all. The dash alone took it right off our list. What are they thinking with respect to competition? So dated. I will give the A4 this - its interior was better than the BMW's but the driving feel and interior did not flow. I recall the Audi's interiors easily being industry leading from the early 90s until the early 2000s. Don't know what happened but the interior now reminds me of mid-90s VW which was pretty nice but Audi's are not what they used to be. There's no art to them. BTW, the sport package on the MB includes a lowered suspension and a stiffer suspension. Not much else except as you note styling. But the styling is youthful. Nearly all the sell are the sport version. The salesman said they don't even order the C in the luxury version. Same with the E-class.Glad to hear your happy with your Bimmer. They're are many BMWs in my neighborhood, lot of men and women have them. Only a couple of MBs. I think the crowd in their 30s like the image BMW portrays. Certainly more younger that MB. Styling is good on many models. No problem with that. I like German car handling and design intent. I say buy whatever turns your crank! "
"shabadoo25","September 2011"," Sounds like you and your wife are more impressed with bells and whistles than the driving experience. Nothing wrong with that, but the new Kia Optima blows the luxury class away with cabin toys. BMWs appeal to a sportier driving populace that cares less about handbag hooks than they do about performance on a twisty road. "
"smarty666","September 2011"," Agreed, cars like the TSX, G25, etc all belong in this discussion because they are entry level luxury sedans. They have four doors, and come from luxury divisions and hence why the auto industry classifies them as such. Just because someone else doesn't think so does not make it so. Let them keep telling themselves that. "
"ivan_99","September 2011"," I suppose that makes some sense.It's a grey area with me.When I see ""Entry level Luxury Performance Sedan"" I don't automatically think of the lowest model that a manufacturer offers.So I'd say No to the TSX, IS250, G25, etc...the TL would be the representative for Acura's 'entry level', the IS350 would represent Lexus, G37 etc...I don't recall...is there a price cap? Otherwise would the Panamera be the 'entry level'... "
"flightnurse","September 2011"," No the car was on the lot, reason why I got the deal was, people who get 328's want an Auto, this car had been sitting on the lot for a while. Infact you can't order 2011's only 2012s. "
"flightnurse","September 2011"," There is more to the free maintenance then what you are writing! It also comes with a bumperto bumper warranty too. So everything is covered except gas, tires and insurnace  My 2005 BMW 330i with the ZPH package was used hard and the clutch was replaced without a problem from BMW, as well as brakes. Its nice to be able to drive in, and drive out with a loaner BMW and have your car worked on for nothing. BMW has done it right, its keeps the cars uptodate on its services so the value of the car keep says high.Next year we are ordering a 535i and doing the European Delivery so we can enjoy the car in the motherland.

"sweendogy","September 2011"," its been a while since my last post- i have a 07g35x and i love it but have always wanted an awd sedan with a stick shift (g awd is auto only) and at the time when i bot it (in 2007) i could not justify buying the BMW 335xi for a cool 12grand more. The G had more HP, great styling and great driver set up with the nav and premium packages... well lets fast forward - my G has only 28000 miles on it and I still have the craving to drive stick again.. problem being is buying a CPO 335 (2009 or newer) with 6 speed sedan with AWD and the sport package..

"flightnurse","September 2011"," Well this tells you that people who own the BMW you are looking for drives them, is that a bad thing, NO. You can't compare apples and oranges here. You will have to be happy with what ever car you get, if you aren't happy with a BMW of your liking with more miles then your current car, then stop looking for a used car. Get a new one or just wait it out and see if you found one with less miles.The CPO BMW is an excellent deal 6yr or 100K with free maintence can't beat it.If Infiniti really wanted to go after BMW they would copy BMW play book, which is offer your entry level G with a sport package and 6 spd manuel...

"jerseyguy77","September 2011"," I've recently driven each of the cars that are considered in this category and I can't yet make a decision. Since this is my first foray into luxury I really didn't want to find myself regretting my choice in cars. I set out to look at the TSX, IS250, 328i, A4, & G37. After reading some things I added the C300 to the list, which you'll hear about. I am looking for people's input into my decision as I'm still unsure and I'd like to hear how you've liked the brand you chose and its cost to own. I'm scared about ending up with an endless pit of cash to maintain a car. And I'd rather not ""feel the road"" which sounds redundant owning a small car but if I can feel every bump then I may as well buy another corolla and deal with the potholes in Jersey. I was most hopeful going in about the IS from Lexus but found the car to be an exact duplicate of my current corolla from 2005. I hit my head on the roof while driving (I'm only 6ft tall) and i'm a big guy but the cabin felt cramped. Every time I talked to the salesman he acted like I was making a mistake not buying a bigger car. Do no salesman just listen to what you're saying about preference? That car is now off the list and will remain there.I drove the G37 and thought it was a very nice car. It felt ""classy"" inside and, I guess sterile is the word that comes to mind. I actually liked it and liked that it was a bit bigger in the backseat than most in this group. I hate the idea that driving a small car means you can't drive more than 2 adults around. It was about $35 fully loaded with the backup camera and nav and awd, which is cheaper than the competitors. I didn't like the salesman (and his pushiness) but that won't totally sway my decision. I think it drove ok although not as well as the Audi, BMW or the MB. Additionally my mechanic loves these cars and says they are the most reliable. I'm a bit unsure still though because I don't want Nissan parts in my luxury car. Its still on the list. If I can't justify the extra $5k or so then I'll end up in G37 if I had to guess. "
"jerseyguy77","September 2011"," I next drove the TSX. I thought the TSX felt like an Accord. I'm not sure if there is a significant difference in the parts between them but it didn't feel very ""luxury"". I liked that most of everything was included as it didn't feel like you were getting ripped off for everything. I liked that it had a back=up camera (the only real option) with the nav system. And I definitely liked that the car cost less than its competitors. I just don't think I'm going to be able to get off of the lack of feel. Unless it becomes a numbers play in which case this will definitely be in the discussion as it is significantly less expensive. I drove the A4 next and really liked the experience. I take some confidence in the fact that they have been doing AWD longer than anyone else. I also like they seem to think about what you'd like to be able to see which you're driving without having to jump through hoops. I thought their Nav was more intuitive than the others I saw. The ride was also smooth and fluid but I didn't really get to open it up due to the traffic and the flooding around me. I am probably going to retry the test drive at another dealership to get a different experience. My concerns were that I have no idea whether you can negotiate a price on these (it was listed as $42ish for the model I'd want), the back seat looked really small and I was surprised at how wide the car was. For the ""small"" car of the group they seem to be wide. I don't want to end up driving my wife's Altima (which looks puffy) instead of a small luxury car....I definitely would put them at the top of my choice so far though, unfortunately if it was that clear cut I wouldn't be asking for input from you fine folks. "
"jerseyguy77","September 2011"," I drove the 328i next which was always at the top of my list. I figure it can't be on the top of this segment every year for no reason right? I'll start by saying I wasn't happy that it gets worse gas mileage than the others I'd tried up to this point. What I mean by that is to get the same gas mileage i have to avoid the AWD which is supposed to make the BMW great. I figured that they would try to make that equal. I also was a little taken aback by the pompousness of the salespeople who I dealt with. They were basically like, the other people's cars could never do this, and they proceeded to drive around a racetrack they had built to show the car's handling. I'm pretty sure that the A4 and MB (just to start) could do that type of driving if I wanted it to...I mean they're both cut from a similar cloth. Otherwise I did like the car. I thought the navigation system looked like it wasn't made to be in the car. It did feel much more like a sports car than the others I had driven. Since I drove it on a ""test track"" I will be going to a different dealer so that I can drive it on a road with potholes and other bumps to see how it feels. The car has significantly more options and colors than the others in this category which I appreciate because i don't want a white/red/grey/black car. I want a nice color blue and unfortunately the other dealers have never seemed to want to make more than standard dark blue. Its kind of ridiculous. Also assuming that all else is equal I do think the ""extended warranty"" offered by BMW is huge. I would love to not have to pay $50+ for every oil change. Even if i am paying that a bit upfront...The last car I drove, which I may drive again, is the C300. I didn't have this on my list at all as I had heard terrible things about MB over the last few years in regards to reliability and design. I wanted to try the car however as most who I know who've tried it mentioned that it was much better at ""hiding"" the bumps in the road which is a big deal in North jersey. As I mentioned in my first post if I wanted to feel every bump in the road I would just buy another Toyota. In the smaller car segment you feel everything in most cars (which I hate) even though I will only drive a small car. I thought the car was very nice. As nice as the Audi in my experience and I thought there was a very ""expensive"" feel to the drive. I didn't significantly notice the ""cloud"" feeling while driving but i think that had to do with expectations versus results. They are adding a blue color in 12 that I want to see because that may put this ahead. Again though the cost may be prohibitive....we'll see.I'd really love anyone's input into what decisions you made and why on these models. I will probably be making a decision over the next month or so. "
"2233","September 2011"," I've driven all the cars you are considering except the MB. All are nice cars but I would rate them G37 and BMW 328 (a tie for first) and then the A4.The Infinitis seem to be the most reliable. All 3 handle well. I don't like the BMWs interior since it seems dated. The Audi and G have a cleaner looking interior. I don't care for the run flat tires on the BMW but some like them. The deals are better on the Infinitis now unless you currently own a BMW or Audi and qualify for a loyalty incentive. Love the size and exteriors of all 3.I own 2 G35s now and the back seats do not fold down which is a negative. The BMW does not fold down unless you pay for a $400 option for the folding seat.That is why I am probably buying an Infiniti EX 35 AWD. The EX is actually 5 inches shorter than a G37 so some describe it as a combination of a crossover and a coupe. It has the reliablity, performance, handling, good looks, and the ability to haul a bit, albeit a small amount but way more than the G37. The ability to fold down the seats in the EX is huge with me.Some reviewers felt that the EX had a smoother ride than the G37.There is also a $2,000 incentive on the EX so it may be the least expensive of the bunch.When you test drive the right car you will hopefully know it as I did. The EX just felt the best although it may not be considered a sedan by some but an argument can be made that it is.Actually my favorite handling car was the BMW 328xi sport wagon (E91) but the interior was very unattractive and really dated. This clearly is not a sedan though but I liked the storage, utility, smallish size and again handling.Good luck with your search. "
"rayainsw","September 2011"," I do think it would be worth your time to test drive a CTS.Reading between the lines in addition to what you've written here, the CTS may be more to your liking.Just my 0.2 gallons worth of advice...- RayPicking up a new 3 series on Friday... "
"plekto","September 2011"," Your take on the TSX is interesting as the same vehicle is sold in Japan with an ""Accord"" badge on it. It's an evolutionary design if anything and not a real new model. We get the top trim model Accord sent over here and they slap some Acura badges on it. Hence why it's not really satisfying as a real luxury sport sedan. The IS has the same problem in that it shows its Corolla DNA all too well.The G37 as well can't hide the fact that it's a pimped-out 370Z.I'd also recommend taking a serious look at the CTS. It's one of two vehicles that GM makes that are world-class. The rest? Yes, it's typical bean-counting GM idiocy and blandness. I'd not recommend anything else they build. (the other vehicle is sold in Australia, unfortunately).Pros: Cost to repair is less than the European models. About the same as the imports, which have crept up in price without most people noticing.Ride is designed with U.S. drivers and roads in mind.(note - avoid the performance model as the tires are lower profile than necessary) It's a bit stiff as expected, but handles long road trips without any faults.The interior is very nice. Who knew GM could actually make an interior that didn't suck? The NAV system is actually very good. Comparing the NAV system in the Mercedes to the CTS is like comparing a TV dinner to real food. The CTS? It just works.Headroom and overall space is good. One thing about it that's great is that it's actually the same wheelbase size as a E class or 5 series, but the sheet metal is artfully done in such a way that it hides its size and looks a bit smaller. And as a bonus, it doesn't look like everyone else's jellybean. Honestly, you can't tell a G37 from a Hyundai from a Mazda from two blocks away. "
"wireless","September 2011"," I thought about the CTS as well but it gets bad reviews on a couple of items: ""Poor rear visibility; awkward driving position."" Two items that are must haves for me and I would think most people. I doubt I'll ever sacrifice rear-visibility for style, GM gets similar dings on the Camaro. "
"graphicguy","September 2011"," ray....good point about the CTS. The one I drove (coupe) probably had the nicest interior this side of a Maserati. Cadillac did an excellent job. Didn't care much for the seats, but in and out, the coupe is a stunning looking vehicle. If I hadn't had a previously poor experience with a Cadillac (STS) I might have considered one more seriously.That CTS drives well, too.Having been through this test several months ago, I'm probably going to go against the grain. I drove both a C300 and a C350. Really, nothing special on either.....especially for the price. I'd much prefer an A4, or an Acura TL SH AWD, or a BMW over the Benz. E class wasn't bad. But, dang......$60K for a little more sheet metal? No thanks! The C class was overpriced enough, the E class even more. They aren't bad cars.....just nothing I'd consider.If you want driver's cars, probably stick to the BMW, Audi, Acura, even the Infiniti.All the above cars are built well with great materials.However, if I were serious about a Benz, I'd probably look at the CTS, as it more closely resembles driving a Benz, but with a lot more style. "
"rayainsw","September 2011"," ""Poor rear visibility; awkward driving position.""If those are your 2 primary concerns, i would very strongly urge you to try for yourself - as these both can be highly subjective - and will often depend on your size, weight & build.I rented a CTS a few years ago, and did not find big issues with either of these aspects.- RayYMMV "

"plekto","September 2011"," First - Cadillac did sell a BTS in Europe which was 3 series sized and priced, but it sold only a few hundred of them. The CTS is actually their middle model in the lineup if you look at their entire global Cadillac lineup. They just wisely decided to not sell the smaller one in the U.S. It's is more akin the an E or 5 series. Which isn't too surprising, really. It's bigger, it's heavier, and it's not really designed to be a 3 series competitor.As for reliability, my parents have owned a standard model with the smaller 3.0L engine in it and it's been flawless. Not a single problem at all in the first year that they've owned it.And even if something does go wrong, it's a lot less than a Mercedes to fix.Lastly, yes, I know the Japanese companies play around with names and so on, but the comments are all too true. The G37 does share enough DNA with the Z that it's just not possible to hide the fact that it's a modified Nissan Z. And The IS, while it's not *exactly* based upon a Corolla, it's small like one and shares a lot of the same designers behind it. Kind of how a Buick is well, a Buick, even if they come in different sizes.  "

"flightnurse","September 2011"," Not too sure what you are smoking too, just because the the Z and G share some of the same platform they are they are the same car...

"smarty666","September 2011"," I think you better get off your rocker and go out and drive the cars your talking about because it just sounds like crazy talk. A G37 drives and rides completely different from Z, not to mention the fact it has two extra doors on it, duh, and a Corolla completely different from an IS. Just because a luxury company has a parent company does not make their stuff crap. We go by that logic then Cadillac's are glorified Buick's as they both share platforms. Because a car shares some components with another does not make it look or behave like one. "
"plekto","September 2011"," Some Cadillacs *are* unfortunately glorified Buicks. Charging the sheet metal on the exterior or playing with the doors and so on doesn't change a thing for most of these cars. They toned down the suspension on the G37 and added some leather, but it's still a pretty plastic interior and drives more akin to a muscle car than a real sports sedan. It's great in a straight line, but that's about it, really.Is it entry-level luxury? I'd say not. It fails that half of the equation, because almost every car these days can be had with leather and NAV, and so you have to look further and be a bit more discerning in what exactly ""luxury"" means aside from leather and a high price tag.

"alltorque","September 2011"," .............Based on that logic, the Austin A40 my parents had when I was a kid, and the Ferrari Daytona are similar because they share the same designer.

Audis are dearer VWs and Lamborghini, Bugatti and Porsche are merely faster VWs. Jaguar and Land Rover are merely upmarket TATAs and Ferrari and Maserati are very quick, and expensive, Fiats. Rolls Royce ? Upscale BMWs. Vauxhall/Opel/Holden ? Rebodied GM-parts bin cars.Once you get past the SEAT, Skoda and Audi brands, (which basically are re-worked VWs), the logic falls apart pretty rapidly; although there are some component commonalities in amongst the others and their brand-owners mainstream offerings. Way of the world and none the worse for it.By the way, I learned to drive in an Austin A40. Nice little motor, for its day. "
"smarty666","September 2011"," Really, I've felt the same way about the Cadillacs as you do the G37. The interior quality and the fit/finish is still not on the same level as some of the Japanese and German makes. Funny though how the 3-Series is constantly compared to the G37 in comparison tests. I guess the BMW is a muscle car too, lol. If the G37 is not an entry level luxury sedan than the CTS is most certainly not. Except for the BMW which I felt had a slight advantage over the G in handling off the highway, no Caddy handles better than the 3-Series or G37 do at their price range. You want sports luxury, get a BMW, Infiniti, or Audi, plain and simple. "
"2233","September 2011"," I agree with you 100% that great sports/luxury sedans are limited to Audi, BMW and Infiniti. I test drove a couple of 3 series cars yesterday. It felt similar to a G37 but it seemed more tossable on curves and maybe a little more enjoyable to drive. "

Its faster, handles better, stops better and it far better in ride.I love hearing people talk about how great the 60s muscles were, they were pigs, they were slow and they couldn't stop to save lives. 2011 Mustang GT V8 makes more HP then a 69 Mustang Boss 302, faster then a Boss 302, and gets better fuel mileage then the 69 Boss 302. "
"fedlawman","September 2011"," ""the current 3 series is a far better car then the E30 series ever thought it could be. Its faster, handles better, stops better and it far better in ride.""It's also soul-crushingly boring compared to the E30. The E30 is a driver's car. The current 3 is a grocery getter. "
"plekto","September 2011"," The new cars are ""better"" in some ways, but they are simply not as good on mountain roads and zipping in and out of traffic. They weigh too much and their wheelbase is too long. They are simply not anything like the original sport sedans which BMW and Volvo made in the early 70s that created the whole segment.It has gotten so bad that BMW was essentially forced to make the 1 series to remain competitive. The 1 series is at least pretty close to the E36, which is barely passable. A bit heavy, but workable with some weight reduction tricks and some aftermarket tweaks. I put the specs for the older E30, though, because it's really the benchmark for this class. Which every manufacturer seems to have simply ignored in the race to have more and more power. (same as the ""Big 3"" did in the 70s with Muscle cars).Heavier than a Buick. That's just sad and as long as BMW keeps making cars that are heavier than rental-fodder Buicks, well, my comments about them being muscle cars stands. "
"cdnpinhead","September 2011"," the question, regarding Buicks, has to do with what happens when one has an ""incident"" on the autobahn at 135 mph. The Germans are pretty good at analyzing the mess after wrecks of this sort, and making appropriate adjustments.The U.S. regs address a whole different series of things, mostly having to do with fools who don't follow directions (side-impact, anyone?, or how about air bags to protect morons who won't use seat belts?), while the Germans assume people who drive know what they're doing. They just do it at high speed.When the two are combined, Porky the Pig results.What fun! Is it any wonder that most of the people who write articles and participate in the BMW club magazine (Roundel) drive older cars? "
"billyperksii","September 2011"," All this old car new car stuff is getting boring- move on and get use to the new stuff or keeping driving in the nineties. "
"flightnurse","September 2011"," My conclusion of you is you haven't driven the cars in which you bash. I think you like to hear yourself ramble on about things you have no first hand knowledge. As someone who had some of the ""true muscle"" of the 60s and 70s and currently drive a muscle car of today. I will never buy the older cars again, the cars today are much better put together (again I have first hand knowledge on this subject) they are faster, stop better and handle better. So until you have first hand knowledge of the subject you talk about its all rambling from someone who has no idea what they are talking about. "
"ivan_99","September 2011"," wow...the most disturbing part is 20 years has gone by since 1991... "
"smarty666","September 2011"," That idea only stands in your head, no one else's or the auto industry. If you using weight as a big determining factor there is more than just that to classify a muscle car vs a sports sedan. They are sport sedans, every car magazine with a review about them call and classify them as such. "
"markcincinnati","September 2011"," I wonder why you test drove the Acura TSX but not the Acura TL. I am no expert in this field, but it seems to me the TL probably compares ""better"" to an Audi A4, BMW 3, Cadillac CTS and Infiniti G (etc, etc). After having owned 29 Audis, I sent emails to dealers requesting quotes on an Acura TL ""advance"" AWD, an Audi A4 Prestige with sport package, an Infiniti (also with several packages including Sport AWD), and a Volvo S60 T6 with several packages to make it comparable to the Audi/Acura Prestige/Advance packages. I was planning to make my decision based on the best deal I could get on any one of these.Although I did look at a TSX, it seemed a step down from the others I mentioned at the beginning of this post -- not a bad car, but more in line with an Audi A3 or perhaps an Infiniti G25 or a more basic version of some other car lines aspirational cars.A point is that, to me, all of the cars in this class were contenders and I drove all of them (excluding the MB, why I can't recall). Three of the cars stood out as high performers (four, actually, but I'll get to that in a moment): the Acura TL SH-AWD Advance, the Audi A4 Prestige with Sport package and 8-spd Tiptronic and the Volvo S60 T6 with several packages to increase its lux content levels to that of the Audi and the Acura. The fourth car that didn't make it to the finals was the G37X S -- a car I wanted to want, since I am so impressed with my wife's 2011 FX35/Premium (to say nothing of the $1,000 loyalty bonus).The G didn't make it because it seemed so much smaller than the rest. I later figured out why -- it is less than 70"" wide, and it just seems cramped from behind the wheel. The TL, for instance is 74"" wide and has a 63.8"" track compared to the G's 60.2"" track. I made my decision, after 29 Audis in a row, based on price per month. I was ready to take (and I wanted) an Audi A4 first, the TL second and the Volvo third. I test drove the heck out of the cars (and I currently have a 2009 Audi A4 Prestige Sport) and determined that the Audi remained my fave (but, just barely, as the other two were very close.) Yet, both the Acura and the Volvo were so much more powerful and actually seemed larger than the Audi, which was a plus since I often have my in-laws in the back seat.When all was said and done, the Audi came in nearly $200 per month higher for 6 months longer than the Acura and the Volvo was about the same as the Audi but for 36 months to the Audi's 42.I took the lowest cost alternative -- and since it came in with the Advance package it is, MSRP wise, about the same as the Audi, but has a 305HP engine, although it lacks the Audis 8 speed transmission.Having tested and previously having owned an Audi S4, I came away thinking the Acura TL SH-AWD (what a mouthful) was ""somewhat closer"" to an S4 than it is to an A4, and for $11,500 less with similar content.Sorry for the long story, but I think you should have at least tested the TL, it is a completely different car than the TSX, and seems like it would be less likely to be cross shopped with an A4 or G37, etc. The TL, on the other hand at $47,000 with ""the works"" is about the same price and class as the A4 and G37 (and the CTS for that matter.) In any case, in the entry level sport luxury class or whatever this is, most of these cars are winners. :surprise: "
"carnaught","September 2011"," Something else that needs to be considered with the TL are its controversial looks which most do not like and the fact that, at least with my, and many others experience, they develop numerous squeaks and rattles and the interior seats show wear prematurely. Maybe this latest TL iteration is improved with regard to those issues, however. "
"fedlawman","September 2011"," ""the most disturbing part is 20 years has gone by since 1991""The E36 came out in 1991. The beginning of the end...  "
"markcincinnati","September 2011"," The TL I was referring to is the 2012 which underwent a nose ectomy, a butt ectomy the addition of a bunch of sound deadening and a delightful 6 speed auto. It is, now, better looking -- not an Audi mind you -- but better looking without the BEAK.I am, at this point, unable to comment on squeaks and rattles and premature seat wear. Are your comments based on personal experience? A couple of people at my office have Acuras and their primary comment about the cars is ""they are incredibly durable."" Also, at this point, the retained value of the TL is among the highest of any vehicle -- hence its terrific lease programs. I got mine which listed for $47+K with one accessory, back up sensors, for $499 per month for 36 months plus tax.If money were no object, I would get an Audi S4 Prestige with the Sport Diff (torque vectoring). Since money is an object, well, I went with the Acura which seemed like a very high value.I'll let you know if things start rattling and wear out prematurely. "
"nyccarguy","September 2011"," Mark - thanks for the in depth, detailed write up. Congrats on your new TL! Enjoy it for the next 3 years until you get your next Audi.Fedlawman - If it wasn't for the E36, I might have never fallen in love with BMWs. The 1st BMW I ever drove was a close friend's 1995 E36 325is with 5-Speed Stick, Sport Package, & he told me he was able to get it lowered further from the factory (individual?). It made me feel like Superman behind the wheel. "
"fedlawman","September 2011"," Ah, first love! I understand. My first BMW drive was my uncle's E30 325i. Plastic seats and 5-speed stick. Love at first drive.I very much like certain things about the E36 too. I love the VANOS I-6 - it is so smooth and sweet sounding. And the comfort and amenities are a big step up from the E30.And for the record, I think the TL is highly underrated on this forum. It may not be the best at anything, but it does so many things so very well. "
"plekto","September 2011"," Yes, the E36 is somewhat acceptable as well, since with some tweaking, it can be pushed back to 3000lbs. Add some more modern rubber and a few tweaks like beefier calipers and so on and it's pretty nice.What we have now is symptomatic of the bloat-until-it-assumes-the-previous-one-size-larger-model's-place progression that seems to infect all of the makers now. This is also identical to what was happening in the 70s. Bigger and bigger and oh my word that's a huge car all of a sudden...The 1 series is kind of like a E26 V 2.0 in its weight and size. It's what I would consider a sports sedan, if a bit on the heavy side. But what we have now as the current crop of cars are really big bloated grocery hauling machines that just are called ""sporty"" because they are the smallest whales in the pod and happen to have shiny rims and big wheels attached.That said, the TSX simply doesn't belong as it's just a plain vanilla ""Accord"" to the rest of the world. Over here, they slap Acura badges on it and raise the price. It's front wheel drive, has a plain vanilla 4 cylinder engine, and the handling is, well, standard family car. It's a NICE car, but it's not proper luxury OR proper sports. "
"ivan_99","September 2011"," And for the record, I think the TL is highly underrated on this forum. It may not be the best at anything, but it does so many things so very well.Agreed...i liked the 'old' BEAK (think I'm the only one  )...it had flare.Plus I got the SH-AWD to over-steer...so it could be persuaded to have fun too.

"billyperksii","September 2011"," Mark- a man after my own heart, congrats on your excellent choice in value, style and performance.I have the 2009 with the beak and butt, 25 months later and 13k miles-zero squeekes, zero seat wear and all compliments.My salesman keeps sending me emails in regards to a swap for the 2012-NO THANKS, the 2012 IMHO is too soft-appearance wise. "
"m6user","September 2011"," Has anyone noticed that people are actually bigger now than they were twenty years ago? Look at high school football teams. My god they are huge. I think carmakers have responded to some degree. Granted many people are heavier than they should be but the actual frames of each subsequent generation is larger than the previous. Add in all the safety crash protection in the frames, larger brakes, airbags, sunroofs, power everything and it makes for more size and weight in cars. Some may not hear it but weight isn't the only thing that matters in a cars drivablilty. "
"cdnpinhead","September 2011"," Since money is an object, well, I went with the Acura which seemed like a very high value.Welcome aboard! I've been driving a TSX for 3.5 years and enjoy it quite a lot, except for the pair of wheels doing the propulsion. Mine is a pre-beak edition with a manual transmission; don't much care for the styling after the '08s. The original concept was to drive this 3-4 years, then trade it for the diesel TSX, but mostly due to CA pollution regs, it didn't come to pass.You came close to getting that M35 (or was it 45?) a few years ago; I'm stunned that you actually pulled the trigger this time. Hope you're pleased with it. I lack the ""Princess & the Pea"" sensitivity to many things that those who populate this board (or who did before it went dead) possess, but haven't noticed any issues with rattles or wear on the leather. "
"flightnurse","September 2011"," Not too sure of I follow your logic on the G37, just because it was smaller doesn't mean its not a sport sedan. I would think the G37 has more interior space then the A4. I looked at the A4 (mid level) I like it but thought the G37 was bigger. "
"ivan_99","September 2011","  Look at high school football teamseven younger...as my trim 90 lbs 8 year old leaves bodies in his wake...just an opening for dad to brag  "
"andres3","September 2011"," because almost every car these days can be had with leather and NAV, and so you have to look further and be a bit more discerning in what exactly ""luxury"" means aside from leather and a high price tag. Not all leathers and NAV systems were created equal. You can have grade A leather, grade b, grade C, grade D, grade F. The way it is put together, installed, and assmebled can vary in quality as well as the material itself.I thought the Infiniti's I looked at in 2009 were very nice inside. "
"flightnurse","September 2011"," The TL is a great car to commute in, but if you are looking for a car with soul, the Acrua line (except for the NSX) is a company to avoid. The TL really doesn't have much competition since its front wheel drive it isn't taken are seriously as a sport sedan as the BMW. Audi's handle well in quattro form but not so well in FWD version. "
"billyperksii","September 2011"," He did not say the G was not a Sports Sedan- he simply said the interior was too small for his liking. I felt the same way too when I test drove it, the size and the intrusive engine noise made me gave keys back to the salesman in a twinkle of the eye. "
"plekto","September 2011"," And then you test drove the C class or a BMW. Huge difference. Quiet, refined, and what you want in terms of proper luxury. The main reason Acura, Infiniti, and Lexus all come off as trying too hard and a bit plain vanilla is because in Japan, they don't really exist. There is Honda. Period. There is Nissan. End of choices. Toyota just recently stsrted selling Lexus over there, but for almost two decades, it was simply another model of Toyota.Mercedes, they make luxury cars and that's it aside from a few military vehicles and their commercial truck line. It's not a standard vehicle that's been tweaked and had a lot of bling added. It's the real deal. BMW is the same. And Audi, though they are a lot like VW in some ways, has always been its own company and own engineering. A lot like say, Cadillac - there has been some overlap from time to time with the lower end models, but it's always been its own company/line. Acura does nothing for me. In fact, Volvo makes better cars these days. (very nice, in fact, and off of most people's radar here) Infiniti has their highest-end large car, which is good, and proper luxury, but it's also huge and basically like a big Lexus in how it drives. And, lastly, Lexus. Very nice, but still so devoid of soul and personality that it screams ""safe vanilla choice"". "

Your comments make it obvious that you have never actually driven a TSX 6MT at speed.Around town during a test drive, yes, it might resemble a smaller tighter Accord at first glance, but on a racetrack, there is no comparison. Take it from someone who knows first hand, the TSX is a responsive, dynamic, fun-to-drive sport sedan. Period. "
"smarty666","September 2011"," You do realize that vehicles from the 5-Series below and E-Class below are not even considered luxury over in Europe? I suppose not. Hate to break it to you, Caddy has never been it own company/line. It has and always will be a luxury division/line of a larger company, just like Acura, Lexus, Infiniti, and Audi are. I do agree with your comments about Lexus though being a ""safe vanilla choice"". Mercedes Benz is another ""safe vanilla choice"" and neither Lexus nor MB has ever done anything to knock my socks off. They both are devoid of soul and fun.But Infiniti is no way a safe vanilla choice by any stretch of the imagination. That just goes to show you really need to test drive the vehicles you put down. It is quite sad that you limit yourself to the overpriced, poorer reliability of BMW and MB as your only options as true luxury vehicles. "
"nyccarguy","September 2011"," I agree with you 100% fedlawman. Even though my 2010 TSX is equipped with an automatic, it is the best automatic I've ever driven. It holds shifts in M(anual) mode until I (the driver) flicks the paddle on the right for it to upshift. Even in S(port) mode, as long as my foot is planted, the revs will keep climbing to the redline before the transmission upshifts.I've heard the TSX with a 6-speed stick is an absolute blast to drive. We've already got one car in our fleet that my wife cannot drive (my 2001 Honda Prelude Type SH). When we bought the Acura, it was supposed to be her car (replacing our dearly loved 2007 BMW X3). Since we found out child #3 is on her way, we bought my wife a Pilot & I inherited the TSX.Is my TSX perfect? No. Like our resident 1st generation TSX owner says ""the wrong wheels are driving the car."". I don't like the electric power steering.Those who say it is ""just a rebadged Accord"" need to drive the 2 cars back to back. "
"nyccarguy","September 2011"," Back in 2009 I drove an Accord EX-L w/ NAV & a TSX w/ Tech Pkg. Both had almost identical sticker prices. While the Accord's V6 had ""more punch,"" the TSX's I4 was much smoother. The suspension is tuned much more taut in the TSX. The TSX has stiffer anti-roll bars. It is definitely a car you have to drive to appreciate. I'm not saying the TL isn't more of a driver's car with it's 305 hp V6 & SH AWD. It's price of admission is significantly higher than the TSX. It also didn't meet the gas mileage requirements of the cash 4 clunkers program.For the record, I dig ""the beak."" "

"
"plekto","September 2011"," You do realize that vehicles from the 5-Series below and E-Class below are not even considered luxury over in Europe?Absolutely. What's amazing is that we consider an Accord with a fancy badge on it and some upgraded suspension parts to be luxury over here. Now, to be fair, a lot of that is because they are a bit jaded over there, but you'd figure that the minimum standard would at least be something like a 5 series or similar in the U.S. Not re-badged Accords and Buicks and the like.Perhaps we've been driving crap for so long over here that we now consider above average to be fantastic. The TSX might be great to a lot of people, but they are simply unaware. To consider it a ""luxury sport sedan"", well it fails on both accounts. Front wheel drive, underpowered for its weight unless you get the V6, dead steering feel, and, well, the list goes on and on. If you consider it to be awesome luxury, well, more power to you. As for trying to find a ""luxury sport sedan"", well, my take on it is that nobody makes one any more. They now all make large luxury cars with a sporty suspension and needlessly large tires to compensate.Here's a challenge:Find me a car with 2 or 4 doors. If 2 doors, it must have a usable back seat. No, the 911 does not qualify, obviously.It must be rear wheel drive.It must be under 3000lbs.It must be sporty. Not rims and some spoiler but really upgraded.And that's before we add the luxury requirement to the mix. Can anyone here find one? Really. Maybe I forgot some vehicle or something? Everything I find is front wheel drive or hundreds of pounds heavier. Even raising the weight to 3200lbs adds a mere handful of choices in the first category. (since the E36 was 3200 lbs, this is as heavy as I'd consider)**** "

"mortienne","September 2011"," ""I believe that the Lexus brand and the Infiniti brand were created the same year. ""Which wasn't the point under discussion.

"m6user","September 2011"," Are the Hondas sold in Europe the exact same car as the Acuras sold here in the US? When I say exact I don't mean safety because there are obvious differences due to those regulations, but are they the same level of, for want of a better word, luxury. If so, what kind of prices are these cars being sold for in Europe? Maybe the Honda as we know it here wouldn't even sell in Europe because they would be too low rent so to speak. "

"
"smarty666","September 2011"," Of course its a challenge, because the criteria you place on a sports sedan is absurd. I never said the TSX is a sport sedan but the G37 and 3-Series most certainly are. You will find few people who will argue otherwise. I didn't realize that the 16inch and 17inch wheels offered OEM are needlessly large tires? I suppose some 14 inch ones would be better :P The problem is, you and many others place too much emphasis on what the rest of the world is doing in the car market. Who cares what is and what is not offered in Japan, or Germany, China, Korea, etc. Who cares that Lexus, or Infiniti, and Acura are not everywhere around the globe. What matters is they are here and have been for some time now. All that matters is what we are offered here and what we get to choose from. In my life, I have had plenty of mainstream division cars and luxury division vehicles, trust me, there is a big difference between the two. Unfortunately, people such as yourself, go in at bat with the mindset that they are just rebadged junk and not worth the money, but there is more than just the name and price. It is nicer materials, better put together body, longer warranty, better dealership experience, etc and some other perks you get at the luxury companies than the mainstream. I've seen it first hand from many different makes, both American, German, and Japanese. "
"m6user","September 2011"," We live here, lets keep our focus here.I was just curious because I hear so often that many of our luxury brands are just glamorized non-luxury models in other parts of the world. I really wonder if they are that close or are the cars we get here really substantially upgraded when the Acura name goes on for example. If you don't want to answer the question just don't answer it. Nobody appointed you hall monitor. "
"plekto","September 2011"," Why is even finding a 3200lb RWD sedan these days so unreasonable? It's not a problem, because in *Europe*, such vehicles do exist. But we get the jumbo economy sized pigs in the U.S.3600lbs for a 3 series is criminal.When a previous generation Altima came in at 3000lbs, and it wasn't a tiny car, something's gone horribly wrong. It's not unreasonable to expect lightweight and sporty. The Maxda RX8 is (now was - hope the replacement isn't 3500lbs and FWD) 3000lbs. It gets it right. I actually did find a one car that fit my list. At least for a sport sedan. (yes, it has 4 doors, though their choice of having the rear two open backwards was questionable) Why is a G37 500 lbs heavier than a RX8? Surely the engineers aren't ITT Tech drop-outs. Also, from a handling perspective, larger tires will create more lateral grip so that we get better testing scores, but if the car is lighter, it can do just as well with even 15 inch tires. Compare an E30 to today's nonsense. Much smaller suspension parts, smaller tires, smaller brake calipers, and yet it runs much better than the current model in actual driving because you don't have to manhandle the thing and hear the tires howling to get good speed down a twisty road.

"markcincinnati","September 2011"," While not the universal answer to the many complaints about the weight of these cars we go on about, I suspect there is some justification for the piling on of pounds these machines have endured over the years.Among the reasons are the addition of more and more safety devices, electronic nannies (most of which I love), increased sound deadening, more content (which may be luxury content, increased unsprung weight (from ever larger and heavier wheels and tires, etc.)), larger engines, more gears in the transmission (although sometimes there are weight savings with some of the new transmissions. . .sometimes), widespread adoption or availability of AWD, more plush (and heavier) interiors, etc. Simultaneously, I assume the mfgr's are attempting to shave every ounce or pound they can with the use of lighter materials where ever possible and cost effective.As Pogo says ""we have met the enemy and he is us."" We want more luxury features, we want more powerful engines, we want the sportiness. and stickiness of AWD, we want our cars to be quieter and we want the big shiny wheels -- 18-inchers are for sissies, we need 19's, 20's or even bigger (and heavier) ones. We want tires that have side-walls that are super-stiff (hence heavier tires) and we want every possible power amenity: power seat massagers and ventilated seats even. Hell I don't want these things, I NEED them! Doesn't everybody?I suppose ABS and ESP and Brake Assist weigh something -- but gawd, why have a car without that stuff (and I certainly want the OTHER drivers to have these features, since THEY --- not me -- have become such dreadful drivers over the years.)So we're ""stuck"" with ever heavier cars -- because we WANT them, are required by law to have them and are, apparently, willing to pay for them.Frankly, virtually any of the following: Acura TL Advance, Audi A4 Prestige/Sport (or S-Line), BMW 335i xdrive, Cadillac CTS/4 3.6 Performance/Luxury, Infiniti G37X/S or Volvo S60 T6 would be welcome in my garage -- the fact that after 29 Audis in a row I bought a TL was simply that the damn thing came in nearly $200 less per month than the car I wanted, a 2011 Audi A4 Prestige/Sport. That and the 19"" wheels and tires and a very sweet and smooth 305HP engine. Oh yea, and an even better sound system than the B&O system found in the Audi (and THAT is saying something.)I may find, as some suggest here, that the Acura will ultimately prove to be unexciting, uninspiring and prone to rattles and premature leather wear (on the seats). Residual values suggest otherwise, but I don't even have 1,000 miles on the Acura yet, so I am not a reliable or experienced witness.Anyway, kwitcherbitchin', the cars are heavy, heavier, heaviest mostly because we want them that way (or at least most of us do.) :surprise: "
"Kirstie_H","September 2011"," Fortunately, I'm available to take over.As long as the conversation is on-topic (which it is), members are free to discuss anything within the realm of ELLPS, even if the Sedan exists only in Europe or Madagascar, for that matter. "
"shipo","September 2011"," Like it or don't, if you want a car with in excess of 300 hp and 300 lb-ft of torque, you'll also need to buy a car with a heavier engine and drive-train. Throw just the engine from the 335i into a 328i (a process which will bump the weight in and of itself), and just watch what happens to the rest of the drive-train. Not pretty.As has been stated here before, between the regulated in safety features and the market demand for larger and more powerful cars, it is physically impossible to build a relatively inexpensive sedan with the size, safety and performance of a 335i for anywhere near 3,200 pounds. "
"nyccarguy","September 2011"," AMEN to what Mark & Shipo just said! "
"nyccarguy","September 2011"," The goal of every single car manufacturer in the entire world is to SELL CARS! If we all ""did the smart thing"" by paying cash for our Camcord & driving them for 10 - 15 years until the wheels fell off, then luxury cars wouldn't exist. Performance cars wouldn't exist.People have the mindset of: ""I'm paying $40,000 ($50,000) for a car and it better have...""Car companies make a lot of money off people who lease or get new car every 3-5 years. They spend many millions of dollars on advertising and marketing so you make sure you know about ""the latest & greatest"" out there. If you were a ""serial leasee"" and were driving a BMW. When your lease is up and your BMW is still exactly the same, are you going to lease another BMW or try something different.Forget the fact that you are an enthusiast (we are a drop in the bucket). If you were looking at one of these ELLPS today and everything else were equal except BMW's offering was still the E36 328i as it left us in 1998 (I know the E36 coupes stuck around until 1999) would you buy it?Today's E90 3 series is miniature enough as it is. Trunk space is laughable. Imagine if we were talking about an E36, 2 generations ago.The government (& the people) want more safety features. People want higher performance. People want more technology. People want cars that can carry 4 people comfortably. People want cars with generous sized trunks. The car companies are just making what the people want. "

People want more and more, and that just leaves us with a grocery getter and something that is more of a plush luxury sedan rather than anything that resembles true sportiness.To be honest, the trunk space on a E36 is more usable than today's car. Squarer body means a better layout if we're talking about grocery bags and the like. The EPA rated it at 86/10 The current model is 93/12. But it's rounded and the opening is terribly short length-wise.Lastly, the RX8 and the previous Altima both where 3000lbs. Large cars can be light. Sporty cars can also be light - and the RX8 is almost as good as a BMW on a track.

Why? Because A) it has been out of production for nearly a year now,  while the RX-8 may compete on a track with say a 328i, it has far less usable room, drinks more than half again as much fuel for any given distance at any given level of performance, and C) the engine is extremely difficult to clean up from a pollution perspective (one of the biggest reasons why it is no longer in production).The Altima? Seriously? I thought this discussion was about RWD sedans. If you throw FWD into the mix then yes, packaging efficiency and a compact drive-train can be combined to reduce weight; but at a cost (FWD being that cost). "
"flightnurse","September 2011"," The main reason why the RX-8 is out of production was the engine was not effient enough, it past emissions with no problem, but it loved Oil, a quart in every 4K miles. Also I would put a 328 again the RX-8, I would place the 128 again it or 135. "

"m6user","September 2011"," I thought this discussion was about RWD sedansI don't see RWD in the discussion title. If you mean that only RWD can be performance cars than that rules out the TL and the A4 unless you get the AWD. But then it's not RWD is it. Also eliminates the TSX which many on here don't think qualifies but I think it fits in as an ENTRY level luxury performance sedan. You're right about the Mazda or Nissan. They are not premium brands but have some nice offerings. "
"graphicguy","September 2011"," mark...'gratz on the new TL. They are mighty fine cars. Plus, the SH AWD version you have is much closer to an Audi S4 that Audi cares to admit.Looking back, Acura and BMWs are probably my two favorite brands....I've owned 3 TLs and 3-3 Series, which is more than any other brand/model.Like you, I've driven Lexus, Infinitis, MBs, Caddy. The comparable Acura and BMW always wins out over them.Where did you buy yours.....Superior or Columbia? "
"shipo","September 2011"," Maybe I'm confusing threads, but if I recall correctly, the discussion about how heavy cars have gotten included a reference to RWD Sedans. While I'm personally biased toward RWD vehicles, I don't use my bias to exclude other drive layouts from the ELLPS segment. "
"markcincinnati","September 2011"," Thanks for the congrats -- here is the Buying Story.I found a website called CARWOO.COM -- which, for a one time fee, allows you to locate and price a car without revealing your identity. Unlike competing web sites that do essentially the same thing, CARWOO takes money ONLY from the buyer, not from the seller (unless, of course they are lying.) I paid $148 which allowed me to send queries to EVERY Audi, Acura, Infiniti and Volovo dealer in Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana. I limited my selection to the dealers under 200 miles away from Cincinnati.CarWoo allows you to configure the car exactly as you want it and you get a text box to explain any flexibility you may have or anything you will not consider.You then press a button and wait about 24 hours for the CarWoo email machine to start sending you links to your CarWoo account with offers from dealers.To make a long story a bit shorter, Volvo responded quickly and would not budge off of a $1,000 off MSRP discount. Bzzz! Thanks for playing, maybe next time.Infiniti was pretty aggressive and two dealers offered me prices that almost had me saying yes.Audi dealers responded, oddly, (all of them) saying they had no inventory and that any A4 would have to be ordered. One of them finally gave me a price but it was for 42 months, not 36 or 39 and it began with a $7 (for a sub $48,000 A4 for pity's sake).Acura, locally, came in AT BEST, with a 6.5% discount off MSRP (Columbia). A Columbus Ohio dealer -- Lindsay Acura -- came in at 13% off MSRP for a 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD Advance with backup sensors (which are about a $715 accessory.) Here's the funny thing, they sourced the car from Columbia -- I have the window sticker! Whatsupwiththat?!?The car was $499 per month + tax.I had driven ALL of the cars (not a Lexus or MB of any kind) multiple multiple times and really liked the A4 (what's not to like I still have my 2009 for another 30 days?), the M37X and the TL SH-AWD (Advance model). Likewise I thought the Volvo S60 T6 was GREAT FUN! I also had a chance to drive a Premium+ Audi S4 (without the sport diff -- aka no torque vectoring.) Now THAT car was the most fun of all (but in Premium+ mode had much less ""content"" than the other cars I had tested, plus is was mo' money, big time.)Truth be told in what was nearly a back to back to back experience, I drove the Audi, the Cadillac and the Acura over the exact same route for about the exact same time, speeds, tunes on the sound system, etc, etc, in one day's worth of test drives.I am hoping not to receive a bunch of ""ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND"" posts, but I will venture to say this -- the Acura TL SH-AWD Advance is very close in performance and overall ""character"" to an Audi S4 -- and although very nice and perhaps ""dressier,"" the Cadillac CTS/4 3.6 with the 19"" wheel performance option was the least inspiring of the bunch.Now the Acura TL SH-AWD Advance is no Audi S4, I am not saying it is, the S4 would be the winner, but contented to match the Acura was just shy of $12,000 more and I could not muster the one that I drove (which was not contented thusly) into and out of corners THAT much quicker than I could the Acura (which may have had an advantage over the Audi at the time since the Acura had torque vectoring and the the Audi did not. Moreover, the Audi did seem more prone to wallowing through corners as if it had more understeer than the Acura, which, even though it was slower seemed perhaps better balanced than the Audi.So, I says to myself, the Acura (as equipped to my tastes) was just under $48,000 (including shipping, but excluding tax), and my price was about $8,000 off of that -- thank you CarWoo.Com.No one else even came close.Remember I was pricing an A4 2.0T Prestige 8-spd Tip w/sport package and wood which came in pretty close MSRP wise to the Acura. The Cadillac had attractive offers but other than its glizt left me thinking it was not focussed on performance as much as the other guys. And, the Cadillac had one thing missing that, for me, was a deal breaker -- a $53,000 CTS does not have grab handles for the front seat passenger or driver. All the other guys do -- and I consider them essential, basic, standard, normal and required. How much do grab handles cost anyway -- in a $53,000 car, maybe $50? What were they thinking? And, moreover, Cadillac in the 4-door CTS does not even offer a blind spot warning system -- which came standard on both the Audi and the Acura at the trim levels I spec'd.So, thus far, I am missing the Audi new car smell, I miss automatic windshield wipers and bi-xenons (but I rarely can turn on my high beams, so that is not that big of a deal) -- and, oddly enough, I miss the Audi needle sweep when I start the Acura up.Then, I get on the highway and press my foot down, arousing a 305HP 274 pound feet of torque super smooth engine, watch the power shift from the front to the rear wheels and, zip, I'm at 80MPH in a distance that seems not much longer than my driveway.Loving the cooled seats and the best sound system I have ever heard in any car (including the B&O in Audi which had been my previous fave.)Having said all of this -- I probably still would have gone with the Audi 2.0T Prestige Sport if it had come in at a price to match the Acura.Money talks, as the saying goes. . . :surprise: "
"nyccarguy","September 2011"," Yes the RX8 is light, Balanced,RWD, & Nimble. Like shipo says, at costs. The engine's torque peaks at a very lofty RPM and my Dad's 2010 Chevy Tahoe gets better gas mileage. Before you quote me EPA sticker numbers, find out what the real world MPG is on an RX8. "
"nyccarguy","September 2011"," Great deal & a great write up on a fantastic car. "
"graphicguy","September 2011"," Mark...cool! As NYC said, great write-up.I'm familiar with both Columbia and Hidy. Funny that Hidy was trying to sell a car that was on Columbia's lot.Interesting about CARWOO, also. Personally, I don't care if dealers know my identity. But, I can see where if you didn't want to be bothered with having them contact you where it might be useful.Anyway, that TL is a very nice ride. You'll like it during the time you have it parked in your driveway.Funny about Audis. When I was looking several months ago, S4s were on my shopping list. The Cincinnati dealer told me they had such limited stock of everything because the factory wasn't shipping them as many cars. That included their volume model the A4. They had one S4, but it wasn't even close to what I was looking for, and it was a demo.The Audi store in Dayton had one, but it was a 2K mi trade-in (wonder how much of a bath that owner took) who wanted the (then new) A7 instead.Beechmont had the best selection with 4 S4s at the time. But, like you, I couldn't see where the price delta was worth it to pay that much more over the similar TL SH AWD.BMW is offering to do a factory performance retrofit on my 335i, which would up both the HP and the torque by about 7%. Understand, I believe that BMW is stretching the truth about how much HP and torque the 335i motor is putting out in factory trim (it's a lot more). The kicker, I can do the facotry performance upgrade at my dealership, complete with normal BMW warranty for $600. I'm debating if I'll want it. My car's already as fast as greased lightening, how much more could I want? But, we're talking 20 extra ponies here. "

They start to run together.I'm familiar with Lindsay, too. While, I've not visited the store, I had dealt with one of the sales people there, who wasn't very good. I was looking for a particular color combo. He said he had it. When I asked him for the VIN#, he strung me along, wanting me to come to the store to ""talk about the car"". I wanted to make sure they had the color combo before making a 90 minute drive. I told him all it would take for me to drive up to visit him was the VIN so I could confirm he had what I wanted. He couldn't/wouldn't He wouldn't assure me of that.Again, congrats on the car. It's a very nice one that you're going to enjoy a lot.kyfdx.....here's the blurb on Edmunds (which my dealer confirms they can do).....http://www.insideline.com/bmw/1-series/bmw-offers-performance-power-kit-for-135i- -and-335i.htmlI know the previous 135/335 had the twin turbo (N54), and the new ones have the twin scroll turbo (N55). I've driven both. The N54 had a bit of turbo lag (not much). But, BMW overboosts it at higher RPM (which is why the 335is is rated with more HP and torque than the N55. However, I think both motors are under rated and put out more HP and torque than BMW says they do.That said, I'm trying to decide if I want the extra HP/torque. That would essentially make my 335i coupe with the same engine performance as the 335is, which is mighty good.But, mine is really good to begin with. I'm debating but probably will do it when I can schedule some time at the dealership to get it done. Who doesn't like more HP and torque? :shades: How's your new Z4, BTW? Did you ever post pics? "
"plekto","September 2011"," Maybe I'm confusing threads, but if I recall correctly, the discussion about how heavy cars have gotten included a reference to RWD Sedans. While I'm personally biased toward RWD vehicles, I don't use my bias to exclude other drive layouts from the ELLPS segment. I didn't exclude FWD or AWD cars, it's just that BMW's earlier models set the standard for the class, which led to the best example, the E30. (also Volvo did make a 240 turbo which was nearly identical at the time). That both were RWD was just because that's how they liked to make cars.But as far as weight, 3500+ lbs isn't sporty. Not when you add in fuel, fluids, a battery, and normal stuff like a spare tire, which aren't part of the ""dry weight"" listed. That adds another 200-300 lbs or so, conservatively. Then add in a typical driver, and you can be at or near 4000lbs rolling down the road. Physics dictate that you cannot get a 2 ton anything to turn on a dime and actually be nimble.Now, compared by decades of sofa on wheels, yes, they could be described as ""sporty."" But they're a far, far cry from their original roots.Oh, I thought of another possible small sport sedan to add to the under 3000lbs list - the Mini Cooper S. In fact, this is a perfect example, because on paper the turning radius is actually worse than a 128i. (vs 35.1 vs 36.2 ft) But drive one and it's a huge difference in how they actually move and handle. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TF4YWKWjLIkHere is the 128i vs the Cooper. Of note is the huge difference in slalom speeds. Weight is a huge problem that even better tires and RWD can't completely mitigate. In something like a TSX, well, the slalom speed for a TSX is 64.6 mph (both Edmunds, same exact testing methods) The original E36 M3? Edmunds managed to get one to go 75mph through their slalom. Just a whole other planet compared to today's cars. "

Terenzo and Lerici.Thursday, 22 Sept. &#150; Drove north to Switzerland. Stayed overnight in San Bernardino.Friday, 23 Sept. &#150; Drove north then east to Memmingen, Germany. Toured the old city in the afternoon.Saturday, 24 Sept. &#150; Briefly toured other areas close to the hotel in the morning and enjoyed the local farmers&#146; market. Drove to Munich Airport & flew back to the US.Overall comments: This was a terrific experience for my daughter and me. We were very fortunate, weather-wise. We had some rain overnight the first night, but it cleared by mid-morning. It rained cats & dogs & buckets during the latter part of the drive to the La Spezia area, and was quite windy much of the overnight &#150; but it cleared by morning, and that resulted in more surf than one would expect on the Mediterranean coast, while we toured the Cinque Terre villages. The scenery and the weather those days and driving while in Austria and Switzerland were almost literally breathtaking.Oh, and the BMW 335iS Coupe [ Le Mans Blue, Gray, DCT ] ran flawlessly the whole time &#150; just over 1,000 miles. Counting the days now until [re-]delivery.I plan to post details in the CCBA forum about several of the days, with links to photographs on photobucket &#150; but that may take another few days.Cheers,- RayHappy BMW driver . . .

"markcincinnati","September 2011"," I am pretty well convinced that my 2012 TL will outperform my 2009 A4 2.0T, too. The Audi, which has Audi Drive Select, can be put into ""dynamic"" mode and that makes the steering more responsive and the dampers more firm and the transmission shift at higher speeds. It has 19"" wheels with Ultra High Performance Yoko S.Advan (?) all-season tires (35% aspect ratio).It has rear wheel drive biased quattro and last but not least has 211HP and 258 lb ft of torque with the power going through a 6 speed automatic ""tiptronic"" transmission.It, the Audi that is, is and has been great fun to drive and it is confidence inspiring to the max.The TL isn't quite as hunkered down feeling, but it is wider and has about a 1"" shorter wheelbase. It is nose heavier than the Audi (but not a whole lot), rides on similar tires (but not Ultra High Performance) of 40% aspect ratio is front biased AWD, but also includes torque vectoring. It feels a bit softer than the A4, it is quieter and feels a bit larger -- but it has 305HP and 274 lb feet of torque, and when properly applied when cornering, the damn thing seems to be able to magically go from a nose heavy understeering blob, to an oversteering (slightly) taught, tight curve carver.The Audi probably can cut the corners about at the same speeds, or maybe higher than the Acura, even without torque vectoring -- but when coming out of the curve the 305HP allows the Acura to always show the Audi its tail lights. My Audi, all in, was $49K (MSRP) The Acura, just south of $48K -- at these prices power rules. And, overall the Acura is a very nice place to spend some time either behind the wheel or as a passenger enjoying the ventilated seats (that the Audi lacks).Said it before, irrational as it might be, if the Audi were the same lease price per month as the Acura (that is about $200 less), I would have gone with another Audi -- just for that special something that only a German car seems to offer.Irrational.Couldn't see the price per month delta though and that seems rational. I am overall quite pleased with the Acura and if they continue to improve and move forward AND keep their value prop, well, I could become a TRUE BELIEVER.

That....we absolutely agree upon!Your TL, my 3, the Audis....all of them do amazing things, as they should, at the price points they sell at.They do so dynamically, comfortably.....I know I averaged about 21 MPG on my TL SH AWD. I'm averaging about 24 MPG on my 335i (which amazes me even more). I don't baby my cars, either.These cars have come far. "
"nyccarguy","September 2011"," graphicguy & markincincinati - I think the 2 major things you'll both notice that are different between your current & former TL SH AWD & current BMW & Audi are:Steering. Having never driven a TL SH AWD, just my 2010 TSX, I can tell you the electric power steering stinks. Road feel is non-existant at low speeds. At higher speeds it is really nice and tight though. Brakes. There is a reason that my TSX is less expensive than pretty much every other car in this segment. Acura honda had to cut corners somewhere. The brakes on my TSX are terrible. Nothing at all like BMW's RIGHT NOW brakes with their incredible pedal firmness & physics defying stopping ability.Obviously power is different too. Mark's Acura is definitely faster than his former A4, while graphicguy's 335 has the ability to outrun pretty much 90% of the normal cars on the road "
"tlong","September 2011"," I had a 1998 A4 (6 cyl) and have an '05 TL. Differences between the two:- TL has more electronic goodies (but 7 year newer car)- TL poorer handler, wallows in turns- TL's climate control much quieter- Audi interior clearly nicer- Audi control feel and driving feel clearly better- Audi inspired much more passion- Audi extremely expensive to maintain, the few things that broke were a LOT- Acura has been outstandingly reliable and cheap to maintain "
"sweendogy","September 2011"," Breaks are not the only thing that makes the acura tsx less expensive. 4 vtek which is in every other honda product prob being the biggest saver of money for the acura car, lets not forget the accord platform. Its not really a sports sedan but more of a sporty sedan, as 90% of them are sold with automatics. (same thing with the TL, nice rig for sure but not a true sports sedan- even in sh-awd form) Closest to the germans is Infiniti by far-- rear wheel drive, good breaks, sports packages, manual transmissions (which are sadly going away) . Cars from the far east are closer then they have ever been but its going to be interesting to see what car companies do in the upcoming years as they need to keep up with MPG mandates - I know BMW will be bringing a 4cy to the states soon, Acura can use the turbo 4 it already produces, infiniti will team with MB for its next line of engines, should be interesting. "
"nyccarguy","September 2011"," I might be mistaken, but off the top of my head the only other Honda Product that uses the exact same motor (2.4L - 201 hp - 176 lb/ft torque) is the Civic Si.I'll agree with you that under extreme circumstances, my TSX shows it's Accord Platform roots. We have some seriously twisty back roads here in southwestern Connecticut. There's one particular road where the sign shows ""S"" curves for 1 mile with a 15 mph suggested speed limit. My TSX shows the flaws in it's chassis.Like many here have said, price aside, I'd choose a BMW.Every single car in this segment shines in it's own way. A 3 series equipped like my TSX (or even a TL) costs significantly more, has a smaller back seat, & a smaller trunk. The 3 series is sharper, handles better, drives much better overall. "
"ivan_99","September 2011"," heh...it's a little hard to compare a 98 A4 with even an 05 A4...model change in 02 then again in 05. "
"fedlawman","September 2011"," These references to the Accord platform and Acura's not being a true sport sedan are baseless.So all those Audi A4's built on the Volkswagon B6 platform aren't sport sedans either?And I suppose the BMW 3-series isn't really a sport sedan because it shares a platform with an SUV and a FWD car? "
"tlong","September 2011"," heh...it's a little hard to compare a 98 A4 with even an 05 A4...model change in 02 then again in 05.I don't think the general characteristics between Acura and Audi (driving feel, interiors, costs, reliability) have changed in any fundamental way over the time period. "
"ivan_99","September 2011"," I do...way back, I had a 97 A4 and it felt, drove, smelled...very differently from the 05's. Not vastly like going from a Hummer H1 to a Fiat 500...I originally intended to convey that a 05 TL should be compared to a 05 A4...even if the 'old' Audi was superior in specific categories.Reliability: Last time I compared JD Powers manufacturers reliability the ""new"" Audi's were on par (problems per 100 vehicles) with Toyota's from 5 years ago. "
"graphicguy","September 2011"," nyc.....interesting compare and contrast. My BMW does indeed drive better than my TL SH AWD. That said, the TL was no slouch. Neither were the TSX and RSX I had as loaners. Acura captures a good amount of the BMW feel.Also, little things I've noticed....the HVAC in my TL was better in getting to, and holding temps, hot or cold, with no ""fried feet"" or ""frozen nose"" affect.My 335i is fast....very fast....and will let me corner at any speed that my nerves will allow.Seats were better in the TL. If you care, the stereo in the TL was a big step up vs the one in my 3 (which is actually the upgraded Harmon Kardon stereo). I've driven a lot of premium cars. The stereo in the TL tech package surpasses all of them, by a pretty fair margin.Transmission (autos)....hands down better in the 3....which has one of the best I've ever experienced.Build quality, the BMW gets the nod. As good as Acura is (and Acura is very, very good), BMW is better with gaps, paint, etc. Reliability, hard to say, this is my 3rd BMW and I never had any issues with any of them. But, I've had 3 Acuras, too. Never had any issues with any of them, either.I know me, though. 3 years down the road, I'll be looking for something else.However, given what I'm hearing that 4 cyl (even with turbos) will be the calling card for BMW, I'd probably look elsewhere. I'm fearful powerful 6es, with turbos, gobs of torque everywhere, may not be in BMW's radar in a few years. Hope that's not the case, though.The motor in my 335i is one of the sweetest I've ever driven, as was the 3.7L in the TL. "
"billyperksii","September 2011"," Still putting down Acuras but always inquiring about the next generation TL.Its either you love the brand or just shop somewhere else. "
"markcincinnati","September 2011"," . . .I can tell you that the Acura is not an Audi (DOH!) but as mine is equipped (2012 TL SH-AWD Advance Package), it is a capable car. Believable as an EL Luxury Performance Sedan -- totally believable. It would be more believeable if Acura had chosen the best available Ultra High Performance A/S shoes instead of the ""OK"" Goodyear RS-A's. My 2009 Audi A4 was special ordered with the sport package, which at the time included 19"" 35 series Max Performance Dunlops, Sport Seats and 3 Spoke Sport steering wheel with paddle shifters, and a lowered and stiffened suspension. I also configured mine with a $3,000 option called Audi Drive Select which would actually further stiffen the ride via firming the shocks when you pressed Dynamic mode.I was given, many times, 2009, 2010 and 2011 A4 Premium Plus versions as loaners -- none of them had sport packages or Audi Drive Select.A new A4, even in Prestige dress (but without the sport package option or SLine and Audi Drive Select), feels softer and demonstrates greater body roll than my new TL. A new A4 minus the sport package lacks the bolstered seats (which the TL has) and any attempt to throw the car into curves causes your butt to slip slide away and the A4 in standard suspension trim demonstrates a fair amount of body roll. Meanwhile the TL grips you as you accelerate hard whilst in a corner and the torque vectoring makes the car damn near PIVOT through the corner. The TL is not an A4 and it is, duh, also not an S4. However when talking about these cars' abilities in the twisties, the TL behaves more like an A4 with the SLine or Sport Package and pulls hard enough to ""allow you to imagine"" IMAGINE you are feeling the urge that accompanies pressing the accelerator of an S4 way south. In other words, the TL is caught somewhere between an A4 2.0T Prestige with the Sport Package and Audi Drive Select and an S4 Prestige with the sport differential.Given a magic wand, I would have the S4 Prestige with ADS+Sport Diff -- in a hearbeat.But, without magic, the $12,000 difference (that the S4 commands) tends to change one's mind.This time, even the A4 2.0T Prestige w/Sport priced me out of the Audi market -- especially AFTER I had driven the TL Advance back to back with a 2011 A4 (which, admittedly did NOT have the sport package.)That it takes -- essentially -- a $50,000+ Audi A4 SLine (mine lacked SLine trim bits) to subjectively feel as performance oriented as the TL Advance, says SOMETHING about Acura -- yet, at this point in my experience (1,000 miles), I'm not exactly sure what that something is.The next gen TL is probably the one to make me a repeat and perhaps long-term believer or make me somehow pony up the coin for another Audi. :surprise: "
"flightnurse","September 2011"," Not too sure what people in this forum have been smoking,why are you talking about a S4 and a Acura TL together??? Not even close in comparison... Not too sure even if I would compare the A4 to a TL since the TL is a bigger car with more interior volume. What I find interesting is, it appears Audi has dropped the sport package from the A4 line up, not too sure if that was a smart move for them. "
"nyccarguy","September 2011"," markincincinnati & graphicguyFunny how the 3 of us are at opposite ends of the financial spectrum in our lives, yet have similar tastes & tolerances when it comes to cars.The seats in my TSX is one thing that I absolutely LOVE! They are thickly bolstered, firm, & super comfortable. They do a fantastic job keeping my narrow, 150 lb rear end from sliding around during aggressive handling maneuvers.The main thing that fueled the purchase of my TSX was fuel economy. Back in August 2009 I had a 1990 BMW 325i I bought about a year earlier that wouldn't pass NY state inspection & my trusted mechanic told me I should either find a new engine or start paying him to tear the car's Inline 6 apart to find out what was wrong. Cash 4 Clunkers came about and I realized my car qualified for a $3500 rebate. I was also going to need a car in the next year because the lease on our 2007 X3 was going to end & we were in danger of going way over our 45,000 allotted miles. So I wanted a car that drove great, had a roomy back seat (for our 2 child safety seats), & a generously sized trunk (to accommodate our double stroller).I headed straight to an Audi dealer to drive an A4 Avant. I drove a Premium model & thought it was OK, nothing special. I was also frightened at the prospect of owning an Audi for the long haul. I went an drove a Mini Cooper S Clubman which I didn't like. A very awkward car. Lots of blindspots. Lifeless and very disconnected electric power steering. Rubbery shifter. Clutch with a high take up point.I then stopped by an Acura dealer, drove the TSX & said to myself, I really like this car. It drives like a 4 door version of my 2001 Prelude Type SH. It is by no means perfect, but for the price, it rocks. I've got 2 sons (5 & 2 1/2) and a daughter on the way in early December. Cars are expensive (especially the ones I like). Right now I do too much driving (TSX is 2 years old & has over 40K, while Pilot is 4 months old with 7,000 miles) to lease. Leasing is also very expensive. Nor can I afford to buy cash & trade every 2-3 years.I plan to pay off my car loans in 5 years & keep them for at least 10 years (assuming no mechanical catastrophies or god forbid accidents) so we can (re)build our savings towards retirement & our Children's college educations.I've owned exclusively new cars since I got my license at 16 (besides my E30 BMW which was a project car). I love the way BMWs drive so much that if something happens to my Acura, I'd look for a CPO BMW 335 with the N55 in a heartbeat. "
"graphicguy","September 2011"," flightnurse....having test driven a couple of S4s, and having owned a TL SH AWD, I can honestly say that the TL SH AWD is closer to the S4 than Audi would care to admit. Then, there's the big price delta that you have to consider.Mark.....I did indeed find both the A4 (S-line) and S4 ""softer"" than the TL. Not that it's a bad thing....just something I noticed. I really loved the TL SH AWD's seats....some of the best in any car I've owned. They hold you well without cramping. Or, maybe my body type is best made for Acura's sport seats.NYC....IIRC, I think I've got a decade or so in age on you. However, I can see you going down my same car desire path. If you don't have any more children (go ahead, have a bunch more), you'll get out of the ""I need a people hauler"" mode and start bouncing around the top German and Japanese lux brands as your preferences.Don't see you in a Lexus. I can see you in a TL, or another 3, probably a 5er at some point.....maybe an A6.  "
"fedlawman","September 2011"," NYC,Graphicguy makes some good points. I'm about 10 years ahead of you too...My daughter will get her learner's permit next year and I've already started teaching her how to drive a stick on the weekends (yes, in the M3!). The family dynamic will change permanently when she starts driving.We got the V70 with 3rd row almost 8 years ago and it's been a great family hauler, but when my daughter starts driving, we have some choices to make. Keep the wagon and give it to her?Also, my wife hates the M3 - refuses to drive it except as a last resort. I've started thinking that it's selfish of me to keep it around if I'm the only one who is ever going to drive it. Plus, I have a company car for work, so I only drive the M on weekends or when the sun's out and I get a hankering. It sits in the garage with a trickle charger for most of the winter.So we could keep the Volvo and sell the M3. Let my daughter use the Volvo and get a 911 or 135i or something for me and my wife to share.We could sell the Volvo and the M3 and get a 135i plus a Subaru Outback.We could keep both the Volvo and the M3 and get a 3rd car like a Focus or Cruze for my daughter.Whatever we decide, there are definitely some confusing issues with the changing family dynamic and the car market. Cars are crazy expensive now and like you (and others here), the cars I like are expensive. I would rather not spend $50k on a car, but nothing I have looked at that I like costs less than $40k.I was a new car buyer for many years too, but since I started driving BMW's (my E30 325i was my first one 7 years ago), I can't help thinking there's no value in it. I might try a CPO car next to add some value to the process.Whatever we decide, trading and buying a new car every 3 years is definitely out. I love the fact that the Volvo is paid for and 8 years old, and my wife stills loves the car. The Volvo experience has taught me to buy the most car I can afford and keep it as long as possible. "
"qbrozen","September 2011"," I've pretty much given up on the idea of ever having a new car again, personally. And with as often as I trade, it is probably for the best anyway. "
"flightnurse","September 2011"," Interesting, having driven a couple of S4 myself and a new TL-SH AWD I thought the S4 was by far the better car, the Audi did not lean as much as the TL in corners and I thought the Quattro system was set up for more rear wheel bias then the Acrua. I also thought the Acrua didn't have the low end grunt that the Audi had too. However the looks of the Acrua even after a mid refresh to me is just ugly, its hard to beat the Audis in looks and overall design. "
"markcincinnati","September 2011"," Well, having driven both the S4 and the TL back to back, I can say they are close, if you don't consider the price -- the TL is, IMHO, kind of an Audi AS4, if such an animal actually was available from Audi. Of the Audi S4 and Acura TL, Automobile Magazine said:""If it seems like neither car can pull an advantage here without the other catching up, you've been paying attention. The final equalizer is that, comparably equipped, the Audi costs nearly $11,500 more than the Acura. That kind of money can buy the TL a serious brake upgrade. But the price difference isn't much of a factor here, since we've never actually heard of someone cross-shopping a TL and an S4."" Well, I sorta did. . . ""The Acura is blessed with nearly perfect cornering balance, so its rear differential can easily and dramatically alter the car's handling attitude. It takes a little while to build up trust in the system, but you soon realize that if the car can handle any amount of power in the middle of a turn, it can handle anything the V-6 can throw at it. There's no reason to be scared of the right pedal-the TL begs you to steer it with the throttle. The more power you add, the more neutral the TL's cornering balance and the faster it scrambles through turns. Indeed, the Acura was faster than the Audi through nearly every single corner at BeaveRun.""And furthermore:""It's beside the point to declare a winner or loser when comparing two cars that fall into such different hands in the real world. As that most rabid of enthusiasts, you already have your own prejudices and opinions based on the brands alone, not to mention the countries from which they hail. If we could combine the Audi's good looks, brakes, and tupercharged V-6 with the Acura's steering, handling, and all-wheel-drive system, we'd have discovered luxury car nirvana for the enthusiast driver.

"nyccarguy","September 2011"," Fedlawman - if for some reason you do have to part ways with your beloved E30 M3, I don't think a 135i is the car for you. Do yourself a favor & get a 911.BTW, speaking of women & M3s, I was pumping gas into my Pilot yesterday & a woman in her 50's pulls up next to me in a 1997 E36 M3 Sedan. 5 speed, Motorsport wheels.

"nyccarguy","September 2011"," I like your opinion on the Audi Drive Select. So you'd take a $50,000 A4 2.0T with Audi Drive Select (trick rear diff) over a $50,000 S4 without it? "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," why are they baseless? just because it's got a Acura badge and not Honda does not make it a sports sedan - sporty 'er' yes. but same platform and drive train, so I don't get your point. the a4 and vw platform - well the current line of vw does not have quarto or 4 motion on the sedans. I would say that's a major difference. the 3 series comment now thats baseless.

"fedlawman","October 2011"," I'm not talking about the badge on the hood. You haven't explained why you think the Accord platform is less suited to underpinning a sport sedan than the VW/Audi platform or the BMW 3-series platform.Is it not as rigid? Is the suspension geometry inferior? "
"flightnurse","October 2011"," Platform and same engine doesn't equal same car.. The Acrua suspension is tuned for more sporty driving then the Accord. I would also suspect the Automatic in the Acrua is tuned for quicker shifts then the Accord. The Audi and VW platforms is what I just talked about might be some of the same but the tuning of the suspensions is completely different...Also the Leather in the Acura is a far better grade then that of the Accord.

"fedlawman","October 2011"," ""speaking of women & M3s, I was pumping gas into my Pilot yesterday & a woman in her 50's pulls up next to me in a 1997 E36 M3 Sedan""A few weeks ago, I was driving around town in my M3 and while sitting at a light, a middle-aged woman in an E28 M5 pulled up next to me. I rolled down my window and waved to get her attention, but her eyes were glued in front of her. We actually traveled down the road a few blocks in sight of each other and she never once made eye contact with me (and I was practically flailing my arms to get her attention).How is it possible to own a car like that and not notice a comrade-in-arms?!?! "
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," Short answer, no. At this point, an Audi A4 2.0T Prestige + SLine with everything on it except ADS would be a great car. I have ADS, I have, currently both a 2009 A4 Prestige + Sport Pakage (that has ADS) and a 2012 Acura TL Advance.In 2009 but not in 2011 or 2012 Audi A4 2.0T Prestige + Sport or SLine packages, I see less of a need for the $3,000 ADS option due to the fact that the new A4's can be had with an 8-speed tiptronic that comes with Sport Shift and in Sport Package or SLine configuration comes with a lowered sport suspension and sport seats and a sport steering wheel with paddle shifters.In other words, TODAY, I would not get an A4 2.0T Prestige + SLine, w/ 8 speed tiptronic and pony up for the ADS.Another reason I would not get this option today: on the A4, Torque Vectoring is not an option (yet). I would pay for the ADS -- on an A4 -- if it came with TV.The S4, at $50,000 is content poor compared with a $47K TL Advance -- but the S4 can be had with TV, under the name Sport Differential. I believe to get TV, however, one needs to buy ADS (on the S4.) The total additional cost to get both ADS+Sport Differential is, as I recall, about $4,500.The S4 I would want would have to be contented to the TL Advance level, and that requires that the S4 be configured NOT as a Premium Plus, but as a Prestige model.If you do all of this to an S4, its MSRP is some $12,000 more than the Acura TL Advance with backup sensors (which is how I have mine configured.)Now, having said all of this, I would rather have the S4 than the TL. Moreover, I would have, at the time, gone with a 2012 Audi A4 2.0T Prestige+SLine without ADS, if the price on a 36 month lease was comparable to the Acura lease (the MSRP's would have been very close to each other so configured.)I should stipulate, that to save a bit, I would be fine with the A4 2.0T Prestige 8-speed tiptronic version with EITHER sport package or SLine, and I know the sport package would have been somewhat less money than SLine, which, for the price difference only includes trim differences not suspension or other performance inducing differences.In any case, my decision was not based on which car I thought was the best -- I went with the one (THIS TIME) that I thought was the BEST VALUE. The TL Advance (with the oddly optional back up sensors @ $725) filled that bill very nicely. My lease on the TL for 36 months was about $150 per month less than the lease on the Audi A4 (Prestige, Sport, etc, etc) for 42 months. At 36 months (apples to apples) the Audi was about $200 per month more than the TL which, although it ain't no Audi, is -- for $200 per month less -- a fine imitation.I've had 29 Audis, since 1977. I have been to the Ingolstadt factory for the how they build 'em tour, 6 times. I have participated in 4 Audi driving schools in Seefeld, Austria (and won one of them -- fastest time through the course.) I, for a number of years, would bleed little interconnected rings when cut. Audi of America sent me to St. Moritz along with 49 other of their ""top 50"" North American customers for the Audi sponsored women's downhill ski cup event.And, I bought one of the first A8's in 1997 (ordered in 1996 and waited 11 months) after Audi sent my dealership a Euro-spec A8 and asked the dealer to loan it to his top customers for 24 hours (undoubtedly a ploy to make the star struck customers order up a new A8 -- which I did.)If the above doesn't qualify me at some level to judge or at least opine about the differences and similarities between an Acura TL Advance and an Audi A4 or S4, I don't know what else does.If I could somehow have been convinced that the Audi was not just incrementally better than the Acura, but substantially better, I would have probably gone with the 2012 Audi A4 2.0T Prestige SLine w/8-speed tip. But after driving two Audis, an A4 and an S4 (2011's and the A4 did not have the sport package -- or SLine, and the S4 was what is simply called Premium Plus and it did NOT have the Sport Differential) then driving a Cadillac CTS/4 with the 19"" wheel sport package (2011) and then the Acura TL Advance, I thought the Acura TL was most like an S4 than it was an A4 or a CTS.I also drove a Volvo S60 T6, an Infiniti G37X/S and an Infiniti M37X Premium+Tech, and an Acurca ZDX Tech. While my '09 A4 was in for service I also had been loaned a 2011 Audi A6 3.0T Premium Plus for a day.Every one of these cars were test driven (and I was video'd by my wife whilst I was driving and giving a running commentary) over the exact same route, the sound systems were tested with the exact same CD's/tunes (Wecome to the Machine, Pink Floyd; How Dare You, 10CC; and, New Frontier, Donald Fagen.)So, I offer up for your consideration: the Audi, Acura, Cadillac, Infiniti and Volvo are all great cars and more alike than different, generally speaking. I wouldn't kick any of them out of bed for eating crackers, and I'd even bring the crackers.You can argue that the Audi is the prettiest (which it is) and the Acura the ugliest (well, hell, that's true too -- even though it is less ugly for 2012), the Cadillac is the ""blingy-est"" (no doubt) and the Infiniti's remain the Japanese BMW's, while the Volvo is the most unexpected -- and delightful to drive -- car of the bunch.The Acura does excel in one area: it has the best damn factory sound system I have ever heard.And, for me, an almost S4 at the price of an Acura TL Advance SH-AWD, is a no-brainer.Drive it like you live -- I'll say it again, these are all very nice cars and all deserve your consideration if you are in the $40 - $50K market.I am, for the next two days driving a new Acura TSX which is the loaner car I was given while my TL has the back up sensors grafted to the rear bumper -- it too is a ""nice car,"" but compared to the others in this Edmunds category, it seems like it is out of place, or perhaps, out of its class.That's my story and I'm stickin' to it. "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," your joking when you say the 3 or audi a4 platforms vs the one of the tsx... these cars were developed with autobahn in mind and driving at speeds over 100mph.. the accord was developed in japan and in no way claims to have any sporty intentions, its fwd and comes with a 4cy engine that pumps out 170lbs of torque. this is also the same engine (albeit tweeked) that honda puts in the crv and element.. honda sold millions of accords before the Tsx was even a thought in mister hondas head.

"tlong","October 2011"," I have owned both Audi and Acura. I tend to agree that for a big price, the Audi is generally a nicer car. But your post is biased based upon irrelevant criteria, IMHO. ""Cars developed for the autobahn"" - All of these car companies are selling worldwide and all need to meet various needs of different countries, whether that be suspension tuning or emissions or left/right side drive. Some Accords in fact are developed in the USA. Germans develop cars in the US, GM develops cars in Europe and China and Australia. It's quite simplistic to assume that parent country of origin = where the car is developed.""comes with a 4cy engine that pumps out 170lbs of torque"" - seems to me that BMW and MB have plenty of 4 cyl engines in Europe (on the autobahn  ) and somehow that's ok. ""The Acura TSX has a narrow price elasticity"" - frankly, I don't see why price elasticity has ANYTHING to do with being a sports sedan, as if tacking on $10K to a price makes a non sports-sedan into one.Ultimately, a sports sedan shouldn't be about cachet, or where it was developed, or whether it is fwd or rwd or 4wd, or whether there is an autobahn or potholes nearby, or whether the platform is shared with economy cars, or whether the price is high or low or elastic or inelastic. What matters is how the car handles, how it feels, how well appointed it is. Given those criteria, Acuras are pretty close to a lot of the European offerings. "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," I love the illustrations but they prove little but you did point out that acura/honda did have a good past stable of sports cars but as you know the nsx hasnt been produced since 2005 the s2000 was 09... now given the fact that those 2 cars were rwd and were light weight and were great handlers - something the TL and TSX are not. - Is the A4 a sports sedan->- well thats a great question-- i think in 6speed form with the turbo and awd with the sports package it could be. but I think audi has moved the car into the mainstream to compete vs the TL's and ES's -but in the past with the 2.0 or 1.8 turbo and 6speed for sure it was. the s4/s5 for sure are. the newer car has put on some weight and to get an audi with fwd for me audi is stupid.the tsx is not sporty because of its platform as stated before --its an accord which is a great car but just not sporty. The jetta in standard for is not close to the TSX but in GLI form its more of a sportie sedan then the TSX-(plus its cheaper)- same amt of power.. both have put on weight, but the GLI would be a sportier option given the fact they offer a quick DSG transmission. Same one thats in the GTI. The Jetta R will offer the VR6 in 2012 and get to 60 in 5.5 seconds or about 2.2 seconds quicker then the manual tsx (which only 10% of buyers would get).funny you bring this up -- i leased a acura GS-R and in 2004 had to return it and i considered the TSX, which i liked in manual form ... but I drove the VR6 jetta gli and saved 4k.edmunds tests the gli vs the tsx...http://www.insideline.com/volkswagen/jetta/2006/2005-acura-tsx-vs-2006-volkswage- n-jetta-gli-comparison-test.htmlheres my favorite line ""As much as we liked the refinement of the Acura, the GLI's performance makes it the better sport sedan""good read, eh - i like your passion but again i think we should move this car off the board..i love the track pixs but stay out of the left lane. "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," my post is based on the last 10 years of production. comparison test and sale numbers.""narrow price elasticity"" that was from wiki and stated the v6 acura competes with cars that are considered more sporty options.. its says nothing of ""tacking on"" 10k and calling it more sporty. Ultimately, while i respect your opinion, its about what the experts recommend and what people buy as being a big decider on what a successful car-- and its a fact that acura has lost share to both bmw, audi and infiniti -- im glad you think that acura handles like the germans but the fact of the matter is the critics and car buyers dont care about the current line. Please get me a recent article where and acura product (NON SUV) has beat anyone (not named buick) in a comparison test. I think its great that people support the brand but the brand has gotten old and its roots of the great NSx, LEGEND, AND INtegra GS_R are forgotten in this current line of cars. "
"fedlawman","October 2011"," You and I fundamentally think differently about cars.In my opinion, a sports car is a sports car based on its DNA, not it's horsepower or amount of traction or it's pedigree.I don't believe that the base A4 (a regular car) magically becomes a sports car because you increase the horsepower or add traction. I don't agree that the ""regular"" Jetta is a family car and the GLI is a sport sedan.Does the Mini require a supercharger to be considered a sports car?None of the cars in this segment are ""sports cars."" At best, the sportiest of the bunch is a sporty Grand Tourer. The point is that all of the cars in this segment (including the TSX) are cut from the same cloth. That is, they are cars designed to offer a degree of performance and luxury above the common family car.And to meet you halfway, I'll even say that the TSX with automatic transmission is questionable as a ELLPS. The TSX's saving grace is how the entire driving experience is utterly transformed when equipped with the 6MT.I've said it before - the only people who don't think the TSX is a sport sedan (in the ELLPS context) are people who haven't really driven a 6MT TSX. Around Pacific Raceways, my old TSX was every bit as capable as the BMW 325i's sharing the track with me. It was a joy to drive fast, which is the ultimate test of a sport sedan. "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," I guess Your right a sports car should weigh 3500-4000 lbs and have less the 200 hp and fwd. - the tsx is a sporty car when it's paired with the 6 speed.I drive the 04 tsx and it has the best manual transmission in the segment by far but it's not fast, it handles good for a front driver but it's not a sports car. And the fact that the current acura sales demographic is closer to Buick then BMW. Now i agree that a true sports sedan has prob died due to current weight of the group we speak of. Now for you to disagree with me is fine but what about the edmunds article that declared the jetta gli better then your tsx ? And you are right your tsx could stay with a 325 but the current tsx could not stay with the current 328 and I think that's my point, current Acura models just can't compete because they never evolve. "
"tlong","October 2011"," Since when does the buying demographic have anything to do with how sporty a car is? I see a lot of irrelevance in the arguments. Perhaps some cars don't have ""sports car carpet"" either LOL! "
"fedlawman","October 2011"," I've never driven a Jetta GLI so I can't comment on it. I think it's (a lot) smaller than the TSX and doesn't have as many amenities and has a less refined driveline though - not a near-luxury segment car. I do really like last years cockpit lighting and layout though - very upscale for an economy car.The TSX weighs less than any version of the A4 Audi makes. It's also lighter than the G25 and IS250. And Honda's I-4 makes similar power to both of those competitors V-6 motors. The TSX is also the epitome of a smooth refined driveline. The switchgear/cockpit ergonomics and quality is maybe a notch below Audi but certainly as good as or better than Infiniti, Lexus, and BMW.Plus, if you do own a 2004 6MT TSX, then you know the joy of revving that Honda I-4 up to 7400 RPM - only BMW's legendary I-6 is as satisfying to wind up.And talk about keeping pace - the TSX has soldiered on with the same specs for 8 years and Infiniti comes out with a brand new car that offers a mere 17 more HP and weighs almost 200 lbs more?!?! Acura must be doing something right to inspire Infiniti and Lexus to build such close competitors.Every car in this segment has an Achilles heel. The TSX is the least expensive car here, and it offers a lot of ELLPS for the money. But if you want more than 200HP, then obviously it's not the right choice. "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," Govt mpg mandates have a lot to do with why Infiniti and soon BMW are taking down hp. I dont think it has anything to do with acura inspiration. Now I know the tsx offers little more then you can get in a standard accord except an extra year on the warantee and an acura badge, sure it has nice leather innards but the ergonomics are subject to personal taste. , As edmunds stated in the article the gli slightly beats it as a sport car. I know the sweet vtexh and it's great action manual (whicjlh I hope stays)- but the tsx has only gotten fatter over the years - with no power boost - 90% of them are automatics and it's currently sitting in a stale stable. I'm looking for a recent article that mentions this car as being a sports sedan, one published in the last 3 years. "

"fedlawman","October 2011"," ""Now I know the tsx offers little more then you can get in a standard accord except an extra year on the warantee and an acura badge.""You forgot to mention that the TSX is physically smaller inside and out and has a 4"" shorter wheelbase. It has a higher compression engine with a higher redline and 10 more HP. The TSX also has a beefier rear sway bar, high performance tires, sport suspension, sport seats, and a 6-speed MT. "
"fedlawman","October 2011"," ""2 car and driver articles -- again the acura in the middle of the pack vs cars that are not considered lux cars.""Some TSX quotes from your first link...""Such a treat to drive this car after herding some of the others around the course. So much more certainty, so much more precision."" ""This is a case of all the parts working together?&#128;&#148;quick responses, crisp steering, excellent brakes, minimal body roll, and it's all so easy."" ""Just brimming with confidence. Even on a long, dull interstate, you can feel the athletic tension of the chassis, all ready to burn up some twisties. Bravo!""""As much as we love this car's precision, refinement, and athletic nature, every story we've published about it has made some sort of apology for its relatively modest power... But in this comparison, the power shortage was costly.""Your second link features the V-6 TSX, which is a nose-heavy, numb-steering pig. Not the car I'm talking about. They said it themselves...""The TSX V-6 is a smart cookie that just needs to lighten up a little. Which is code for, ?&#128;&#156;Stick with the manual-transmission, four-cylinder TSX.""So it looks like Car & Driver agrees with me. The 4 cylinder TSX with 6MT is the jewel of the Acura lineup and a superb ELLPS. "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," beefier rear sway bar and all season highperformance tires-ok in other words things you can get at your local autozone.. sport suspension well thats subjective and no where on the acura website does it say sports suspension.the car and driver articles you mention did not bash the TSX but they did say the other cars were better given its middle of the pack results. 2 vws and an accord were considered better cars for the price, ELLPS hahaha. I agree that with you that its the jewel of the acura brand-- but that brand includes the RL and ZDX :confuse: "
"fedlawman","October 2011"," Well, if you really believe that, then you can't be taken seriously here. "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," ?? "
"fedlawman","October 2011"," So you seriously believe that the Accord and Sonata are ELLPS's? "
"fedlawman","October 2011"," You know, I remember the discussion when the TSX first came out in 2003. Back then, it was the Mazda6 owners who challenged that the TSX wasn't a ""luxury"" car and the Mazda6 was superior because it had ""similar amenities"" and a more powerful V6 (a recurring theme...).Well, there is the difficult to articulate quality of precision, refinement, and craftsmanship that the TSX possesses in spades that more pedestrian cars lack.All you have to do is sit behind the wheel of the Sonata and you immediately know it is an economy car. One drive and you instantly feel that lack of chassis and driveline refinement.The Accord is another beast altogether. The Accord is arguably ""luxurious"" enough to compare with the bottom of the ELLPS class. It does lack some features expected here like Xenon headlights, driver memory settings, etc., but more importantly, it lacks a sporting character. It is a big car - softly sprung with flat seats. The precision and refinement are there, but it doesn't have the dynamics of a sport sedan.Yes, you could go online and get summer tires, sway bars, springs/struts and make it a handler, but then what you would have is a large, slushbox equipped, harsh riding family car (Last year, I equipped my Volvo with Bilsteins and know first-hand what a disaster that was!).So why try to shoehorn the Accord into a category it wasn't designed or suited for when Honda already makes a car that is the epitome of the ELLPS segment? A nimble, fun, refined sedan that has a terrific engine and gearbox with a modicum of luxury? "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," i never said that- but I did say the TSX should be moved from this group- it has not ""advanced"" with the rest of the group and in comparison tests it gets beat by ""lesser"" cars - in 2003 it was a player but that was 9 years ago. "
"fedlawman","October 2011"," I agree that it hasn't advanced in horsepower, but I don't think that alone defines this class. "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," HP alone no - but what have they done to improve on the early TSX? more lbs, a v6 that no one buys, a sportwagen, lets not forget about the 5 speed auto. "
"tlong","October 2011"," I actually like the older TSX a LOT better than the new one - heavy, numb, and bloated like how all Hondas and Acuras have been heading lately. "
"fedlawman","October 2011"," I agree. But how is BMW any different?The 328i is the same E90 introduced in 2005 (MY2006), only it has 15 more HP and weighs 100 lbs more. It is eclipsed in HP by several cars in this segment, but it soldiered on. Why? Because it sells.It is the entry point into BMW luxury and prestige. For Acura, the TSX is the entry point into the ELLPS segment. And it sells - warts and all. "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," the current tsx has also gained in weight vs the 2004-2008 model-- how many lbs well 150-- it also lost 4 hp somewhere and gained gained 8 lbs of torque during that time period. So from what you presented BMW is different --yep they added HP and weight, not vice versa. they have also tweeked it a bit since the last refresh-- and are due for another one in 2012 prob a reason why it sells...would love to see a post of something that can merit the agrument besides the fact that you own this car- one time..-a comparo test or a current write up about the sport you talk of.. it was a long time ago when they started this ELLPS blog.. maybe its time for an update with current players-- And it sellls? well it sells better then any other Acura for sure infact its almost half of all acura sales at a total of 32k units for 2010, that is in the us, canada and mexico -- but bmw sold 100k (us only sales) 3 series cars and infiniti also sold 58k of the G series (US ALONE). So i think the warts are showing more then you think. "
"nyccarguy","October 2011"," There are so many cars out there that aren't fantastic at one thing, they don't look good on paper, but they are great cars to drive. My TSX is one car that falls into that category. It's 201 hp 4 cylinder is not going to win any stoplight or out of a toll booth race. You really have to drive a TSX & a V6 Accord back to back. They ""are not"" the same car.You seem to be a ""car guy"" and you know that a factory tuned suspension upgrade is so much better than one you can piece together from autozone or any various Internet site. It's like some people who say ""why do I need to spend $XX,XXX more for an M3 (or S4) when I can just chip my 335i (or A4 2.0T) for $X,XXX and get just as much or even more power?"". There's also a company out there that makes a bolt-on supercharger for a V6 Mustang. It makes the V6 good for 475 horsepower. If you were in the market for a Mustang, would you buy a 5.0 GT or a V6 and get it supercharged? I'll take the V8.I'll agree with you and fedlawman that the TSX V6 is a nose heavy pig. I personally don't think it needs to be in the Acura lineup. A V6 TSX has a sticker damn near a FWD TL & Honda puts crazy $4000 cash incentives on the V6 TSX to sell it. I have the sane gripes with C&D regarding its electric power steering. The original TSX was a smashing success for Acura. I think the 1st year they only expected to sell 15,000 units. How many did they sell that 1st year?You have to remember that us enthusiasts are a sliver of a small percentage of the market. I believe the 2 main gripes (from the general buying public) were the small-ish back seat & modest power output. They made the car bigger (adding weight) and added a V6 option (whic doesn't sell well & adds weight & torque steer) Anything the ""tuner crowd"" says Acura should use from it's parts bin will ruin the car's driving characteristics & appeal. ""Give it SH AWD"" adds weight, cost, & complexity. ""Give it the 4cyl Turbo from the RDX"" adds cost, complexity, & weight. Not to mention torque steer as well. Part of the TSX's charm & appeal in this ELLPS segment is it's price point which it gets from being built on an Accord platform (or being an Accord from the rest of the world), it's 201 horsepower 4 cyl engine, 5 speed automatic transmission (you want a 6 or an 8 speed auto, that'll cost you too), low weight, the fact that Acura even OFFERS a slick shifting 6-Speed manual transmission.Try walking on to your local BMW, Audi, MB, Lexus dealer and tell me how many 3,C,A4,IS have MSRPs under $40,000. Yes I know you can order your car any way you like it. Acura gets you into the door of this segment.Like fedlawman said, drive it against an IS250 & G25 to tell me it isn't competitive and doesn't belong. Ive never driven a G25, but have driven an IS250 AWD (high 90% of sales in the northeast) & it's 201 horsepower V6 accelerates about as fast as a Toyota Yaris. The TSX's base 4cyl is lively & happy to rev all the way to it's 7,000 RPM redline. I can tell you it has a certain Germanic ride quality to it. Very solid and extremely stable on the right side of 80 mph. "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," acura does offer a Manual in both the TSX and TL which i think is great.. but less then 10% of total cars sold-- mainly because the real car drivers are not shopping acura -- OR they would sell more to the real sports fans-- pretty simple-- how many of those TSX leases out on LONG ISLAND are leased with manuals, NYC carguy?? If you want a BMW you can order a base 328 or 128 with a manual and it will outperform this TSX in every way. No one is talking about the tuner crowd here or even the IS or the G25, infact if you were watching last posts you would see the jetta and accord are now comps. We are talking about a car that has not changed in over 10 years except get bigger and heavier thus killing its sporty nature which is why it was in the EELPS but no longer should be considered. "
"m6user","October 2011"," acura does offer a Manual in both the TSX and TL which i think is great.. but less then 10% of total cars sold-- mainly because the real car drivers are not shopping acura Just what percent of BMWs, A4s, C300s, Gs etc etc are sold with manual trannies? I'm pretty sure it's very close to the percentage you attribute to ""non-sports"" cars. Just because they are offered doesn't mean that they sell that many. I think I read somewhere that even BMW is only about 10% sticks. I don't think that manual transmission buy rates should be the determining factor as you keep saying over and over and over again. I also know some pretty darn good car drivers that don't drive sticks for a variety of reasons and certainly not because they can't drive well. As far as the TSX goes, there has to be a entry point to this category and one person is hardly the authority. Edmunds, when comparing to the GTI, said it wasn't as good a sport car or something like that. But, they did put it in the same category. "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," ok but again where is the proof that this car should be here- anything published besides your thoughts would be of great value- the car rags or anything that can substanciate your claim- lets be serious here- the TSX is a great entry level car for someone who is looking for value luxury not sports sorry.. i love the fact that you guys are defending this once great value but again when compared to its true comp its not really the value it once was. Now if you include acura as a brand behind this car it validates my claim - they are nowhere when it comes to sport. They are behind every other major comp in almost every category and have been happy for years being an OK (middle of the road) company. "
"m6user","October 2011"," A better question would be why do you have such a vendetta against it? Acura, as a brand, may have gone astray of some their sportier past models but that doesn't change the TSX that much at least any more than other brands have grown and gotten heavier. Acura is a luxury or a near luxury brand. TSX is it's entry level offering and it's a sedan. The only questionable operative word in the title of this thread then would be performance which is somewhat subjective. So for you to set the bar is quite assuming it seems. "
"cdnpinhead","October 2011"," is this ever going to end?People who own or have driven the 1st gen TSX seem very pleased with it. One or two people who haven't seem to have a near-psychotic problem with it.It's just a car. These days anything with a manual transmission is 80% of the way to being a sports sedan. There aren't many anymore.The last time I remember things getting this weird was when there was a board on here called ""BMW 5-series or Pontiac Grand Prix GTP,"" where people who were totally invested their personal opinions went on for years (well, maybe it was months, but it seemed like years). There was a GM fanboi who just kept on and kept on and kept on.Oh well. . . "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," well the board is to talk about Entry Level Luxury Performance Sedans which I feel and have shown by reviews and sales figures that it does not belong here in its current state. Others have given personal thoughts but nothing concrete on why it belongs here- i like facts over subjective comments to prove a point.and i'm spent. "
"tlong","October 2011"," ok but again where is the proof that this car should be here...Trying to prove a subjective judgement is silly. And citing car magazines (which are also subjective judgments) isn't much better. The fact that we aren't sure means it should probably be IN the discussion. "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," ok then why when comparisons are done by the major car mags and even edmunds is the TSX grouped in with lesser cars? your right that is silly "
"tlong","October 2011"," ok then why when comparisons are done by the major car mags and even edmunds is the TSX grouped in with lesser cars? your right that is sillyWell post 12200 said that facts are better than subjectivity. And all of this is subjective. Wouldn't the sensible way to approach it be to INCLUDE a vehicle if a high fraction of posters (subjectively) think it should be included? There aren't any ""facts"" that clearly put this vehicle OUT of the discussion, and for any ""facts"" one might cite, others could cite similar ""facts"" about different vehicles that would exclude those, too. :surprise: What is silly is that this forum is for just discussions. It's not like anybody has to love any car or buy any particular car. :blush:And by the way, I also feel the TSX is bloated and soft - not all that sport or luxury. But I don't see why it can't be discussed. "
"smarty666","October 2011"," There really is no subcategories of this class, such as premium, performance, etc. This category is made up of all the entry-level luxury offerings of the luxury manufacturers which are the vehicles edmunds has listed here, they just titled the thread wrong. It should be just entry-level luxury sedans, which the TSX falls into. "
"plekto","October 2011"," I can agree to that change. The problem is that the sport sedan has really been replaced with the ""Hot Hatch"" segment in Europe and almost none of it has been offered in the U.S.Small, nimble, fast, and luxurious. Tons of choices in Europe in the hatchback and B class segment. Almost none over here. We get big and heavy luxury vehicles instead. "
"kyfdx","October 2011"," ok but again where is the proof that this car should be hereIt's right up underneath the title, where we put it...This discussion is about those listed cars... not whether someone thinks they belong there... So...lets get back to it... thanks!kyfdx "
"nyccarguy","October 2011"," A large percentage of any of these cars are leased. You can't go by the manual transmission take rate to decide whether or not any particular car belongs in this category. The take rate for manual transmissions in the USA in general is probably less than 10%.People lease for 4 reasons:Business reasons where they can take some sort of tax deduction.They can afford to & like to be in a new car every 2-3 years.Leasing is used as an alternative method of financing that works quite well if you can live within mileage limitations.People lease to get a more expensive car at a cheaper payment. Many of these people do not understand leasing and shouldn't be doing it.There are tons of leased TSXs, TLs, 328s, 335s, A4s, IS 250s... among others in my area.

"rayainsw","October 2011"," Some details: Day 1 &#150; Friday 16 Sept. &#150; delivery & drive to Krimml, Austria:We cleared customs and collected our checked bags without incident. Service on the flight was excellent, and the food [ 2 meals ! ] was quite good. [Lufthansa A340-600.] We met Rolf [ retired BMW employee ] at the designated spot and he drove us [ in his BMW Diesel Wagon ] first to the local BMW dealer in Munich and across the street to acquire several excellent local maps and the toll vignettes [ stickers ] required in Austria and in Switzerland, then delivered us to the Welt. Just in time to watch the 11AM &#145;motorcycle on the stairs&#146; show. Interesting. Rolf charges a very reasonable fee, and it was great to just try to sit back and relax [ after a 6.5 hour flight from Boston ] while he drove and talked.We filled out the required paperwork and the customer service rep. recited a list of potentially useful information &#150; most of which I had seen before on various forums. He was quite efficient and cordial &#150; and answered a few of our questions. The reminder about &#145;no right turn on red&#146; was quite handy &#150; as this was something I had to keep reminding myself about all trip long. And I was cautioned again that Switzerland traffic police allowed no violation of their speed limits &#150; period. Noted. We had about 45 minutes until our scheduled orientation and background presentation, so we sampled various goodies in the &#147;Premier Lounge&#148;. Very nicely done & convenient &#150; high above & overlooking the vehicle delivery area.We had our presentation [ fine, nothing spectacular &#150; for me ] and went to see the car. The customer service rep. pointed out various features [ this is my first BMW ] and set various preferences [ KM vs. Miles for the trip, etc. ] and we were on our way. [ pictures ]Actually just had them park it for another half hour or so, allowing us to peruse their gift shop briefly and pick up a few food & drink items at their caf?, for the afternoon drive.They certainly treat you well and the process is well thought out - and we enjoyed the experience. We could have also done a factory tour and \ or the BMW museum, but I had decided not to do those this time, based on our priorities & our schedule.I had rented a GPS \ Navigation system with appropriate maps, and the first use was to help me drive out of Munich and onto the A8 heading south and east. Worked well here &#150; and several other times, as well. Here it was quite helpful in showing what lane[s] to be in before approaching turns, etc. once on the Autobahn, I was quite well behaved, speed-wise - even on the few unlimited stretches of this highway &#150; breaking in the new motor & all.My daughter was quite tired and dozed off as we left the A8 and headed straight south on A12 \ E45 \ E60 toward the Austrian border.The navigation system routed us differently than I had expected, and I did not realize it immediately. It also re-routed us a few times around what it saw as traffic congestion [ there was none ] so we were a couple of hours later than expected arriving at the B&B in Krimml. A lovely B&B within sight of the Falls. Had a very good dinner in their restaurant &#150; beer brewed on-site, met my daughter&#146;s approval - and we went to bed. = = =Day 2 &#150; Saturday 17 Sept. &#150; Krimml to Verona, ItalyThere had been rain overnight &#150; and there were wispy clouds around the area &#150; with thick overcast. [ pictures ] We had breakfast at about 9 and headed toward the Falls. We actually drove past the Falls and up to a couple of overlooks [ start of the Gerlos Pass \ Alpine Road &#150; pictures ] and then drove back down to park and hike in. The sun came out brilliantly as we started the trek. The hike up to various views of the Falls was fairly steep, but the scenery was quite spectacular. [ pictures ]After we finished the hike, we stopped at their caf? for coffee and an apple strudel. Excellent! We stopped back in the village to just stroll around for a while, just enjoying the ambiance.Then we were off &#150; heading up to the Gerlos Pass. The sun was out and we stopped several times to just enjoy the views. Just after passing the summit [ and paying the toll ] we pulled off at a tiny [ closed ] &#145;kiosk&#146; and scenic vista &#150; lovely lake and glaciers above. [ pictures ]Descending, there was just no where that I could pull over \ off the road to safely stop. And the road demanded attention. The views were often stunning &#150; and the road was in excellent shape [ as were most roads we encountered in Austria ] and I just needed to pay attention. My daughter really enjoyed the views!Heading back north toward the A12 \ E60 we encountered some sort of festival [ in Stumm or Fugen? ] that involved cows with elaborate &#145;headdresses&#146;. Unique in my experience.And we stopped at a McDonalds for a quick bite of lunch. Odd to see their take on menu, etc. And my daughter bought something [ delicious ] from a trailer parked in the lot next door.We hit the highway, toward Innsbruck, turned south and crossed into Italy. This is where we encountered the first real issue of the trip. I had not done sufficient research to realize that the area from before Trento to Verona was as industrialized as it was. My bad. I had expected to be able to simply [ ? ] pick an exit off the highway and find a hotel or B&B to stay for the night. This turned out to be a very bad idea. Long [ and winding = narrow switchbacks, in the dark ] story short: We finally asked a toll-taker at an exit in Verona for a recommendation at about 9PM, and stayed at a hotel just off the highway. Very basic, small rooms, but adequate & inexpensive. = = =Day 3 &#150; Sunday 18 Sept. &#150; Verona to La SpeziaWe had a surprisingly good breakfast at the hotel and then headed south, toward La Spezia. This drive was relatively uneventful, until it started to rain. The highway was well worn [ tire ruts ] in spots and even with brand new Michelins, there were times when I felt it prudent to slow somewhat. And the GPS \ nav again became confused &#150; taking us on a more circuitous route [ even narrower and more winding ] than necessary from La Spezia to Pitelli. Really, really narrow streets. Cars parked on either side. Raining. Not confident of the Nav system&#146;s routing &#150; somewhat stressful. But we did arrive &#150; and not too late = 4:30 or so in the afternoon. After settling in, we asked about a place to have dinner. A few mis-communications and assumptions and much walking later [ and rather wet ] we managed to have pizza at the only place in the village that was actually open at about 6 or 7 on a Sunday evening. It rained, often quite hard, and was quite windy until 3 or 4 AM. Then cleared and calmed. = = =Day 4 & 5 &#150; Monday & Tuesday 19, 20 Sept. &#150; Cinque Terrecontinued... "
"rayainsw","October 2011"," Day 4 & 5 &#150; Monday & Tuesday 19, 20 Sept. &#150; Cinque TerreI had decided early on [ for several reasons ] that we would park the car at the B&B and leave it there until we left on Thursday. We took a bus to La Spezia and then the train to each of the villages &#150; bus stop right across from the B&B.I will not detail everything here. Suffice to say that the scenery and the town buildings are everything we expected, and even more! The color of the water was striking &#150; and the surf generated by the overnight storm added interest and texture. Beautiful. [ pictures ] The high temperatures were a bit warmer than is typical for this time of year all 3 days &#150; but cool each morning, for breakfast outside on the deck.We had gelato each day we stayed here. In fact twice one day - outstanding!! The lunch each day in the different villages was quite good. And the sight-seeing was just amazing. = = =Day 6 &#150; Wednesday 21 Sept. - S. Terenzo and Lerici.The woman who runs the B&B where we were staying suggested that we would enjoy spending some time walking through these two local villages. We did. Interesting architecture. Beautiful old church &#150; castles &#150; lovely. And we had a very good lunch right at the harbor. I&#146;m guessing we walked over 4 miles this day &#150; much of it up and down the hills. But worth every step.Day 7 &#150; Thursday 22 Sept. &#150; La Spezia to S. Bernadino, Switzerland Despite our prior experience, we decided to try the same strategy that had blown up in our faces before &#150; meaning: look for a place to stay for the night, off the highway, once well into Switzerland.Circling around Milan to the southeast, we headed toward Como. Again, the vistas were lovely, but safely pulling off the road to stop and really enjoy them was problematic.[ pictures ]At one point [ perhaps near Chiavenna? ] my daughter noted that one of several waterfalls [ dropping hundreds of feet from the peaks on either side of he road that wound up the valley floor ] looked like we might be able to exit and drive back to see it somewhat closer. She was correct [ that happened a lot ] and it was well worth the slight &#145;detour&#146;. [ pictures ]We ended up staying at an exquisite little hotel in San Bernardino. Just before the entrance to the San Bernardino tunnel, this a tiny old village &#150; primarily geared to skiing. We were &#145;off-season&#146; and the town was very quiet. The water in the creek running through town was clear. The air was crisp, cool and clear. Just lovely. We had excellent fondue for dinner in the hotel&#146;s restaurant and slept well &#150; enjoying the fresh mountain air &#150; at over 5,000 feet elevation. Day 8 &#150; Friday 23 Sept. S. Bernardino to Memmingen, GermanyWe had another excellent breakfast [ more wonderful bread ] at the hotel and headed north. On the Autobahn [ 96 \ E54 \ E43 ] approaching Memmingen, I had my one opportunity to briefly explore the outer limits of [ my experience in ] LEGAL, very high speed driving. A break in traffic [ Friday PM ] allowed a quick blast to 135+ MPH. Exhilarating. But traffic again intervened and I was back to 100 &#150; 115, or so on most of the unlimited sections. This was also the case the next day, Saturday, going to the Munich airport &#150; generally able to hold a steady 100, with a few blasts to 115 or so &#150; then back to 100. Holding 115 MPH for a few minutes at one point was quite satisfying. Being passed while doing 100 MPH by Porsches [ and others, but most often Porsches ] clearly doing 140, 150 MPH or more was quite an experience as well!We arrived in Memmingen in time to spend a few hours exploring the old city area, town square, churches, etc. We ate dinner at the hotel - very good.Day 9 = final day &#150; Saturday 24 Sept. &#150; Memmingen to Munich Airport and fly back to BostonWe slept well, until a local, nearby church rang the &#147;100 o&#146;clock&#148; bells. The ringing just kept on and on &#150; at 7AM. Oh, well &#150; time to rise and shine. Another very traditional breakfast at the hotel, an hour or so at the farmers&#146; market in the town square [ best looking produce and fruit I have ever seen ! ] and we packed up for the last leg of our journey. We drove to a car wash, then to a final fuel stop [ ended with exactly the quarter tank the shipper recommends ] and drove to the airport to drop the car off, and [ after waiting in several lines, including 2 security checkpoints, since we were flying to the US ] we flew home without incident.A few overall impressions:This was a wonderful trip. It is hard to describe the feeling of driving for miles through what looks like the biggest postcard in the world. Large areas of both Switzerland and Austria were absolutely magnificent and spectacular. Cinque Terre was all we had hoped. We spent 2 full days exploring and enjoying all 5 towns and it was amazing. The other 2 small villages we visited near the B&B on our third day there were a charming surprise as well.The times I was stressed were mostly a result of no experience driving anywhere in Europe and knowing very little German or Italian. [ Meaning, mostly my fault. ] I do not expect to return to Europe anytime in the next few years [ if ever ] and my daughter had downloaded a translation app. For both Italian and German - so did not expend a lot of time or effort trying to learn the languages. Some of the country and village roads in Italy were scary narrow. And I wish they had the option to just buy a sticker for use of their toll roads. My one &#145;incident&#146; [ scraped the left front rim ] was while struggling to deal with an un-attended toll booth at an exit somewhere south of Trento after dark. I drove too close to the curb, trying to understand and deal with the instructions and reach the ticket \ credit card slots, etc. [ sigh ] Oh, well.Why not Rome or Florence or Milan or Venice, one might ask? My daughter spent over a week in Italy a couple of years ago, and had an opportunity to visit each of those places. And I was just personally much more interested in the Austrian and Swiss Alps and the Italian Mediterranean coast than the cities. We were both quite happy with our choices!The car &#150; 2011 335iS Coupe, Le Mans Blue, Gray Leather, DCT, Premium Package, Comfort Access, Heated Front Seats, Satellite Radio.http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/car/10q3/2011_bmw_335is-short_take_road_test- - I test drove 2 cars equipped essentially identical to what I bought, except they both had the optional 19&#148; wheels & tires. For me & for my typical driving, I decided that the 18s would be fine &#150; and offer a somewhat better ride. The car was delivered with Michelin Pilots &#150; excellent tires. continued... "
"rayainsw","October 2011"," Given that every time I drove &#145;my&#146; new car, it had my daughter in the co-pilot&#146;s seat and a trunk full of our luggage, I was very impressed with the acceleration and response at every speed and under every condition. [ I am really looking forward to driving it with only me in the car ! ] The performance exhaust system is perfect, for me. The DCT is a jewel, manually or automatically upshifting very, very quickly & with precision, and no perceptible interruption in the flow of TQ application. Very smooth &#150; and fun! And downshifting manually with perfect rev-match every time. Very impressive.I found the ride [ even with fairly low profile RFTs ] to be absolutely perfect &#150; at any speed and on every surface we encountered.I certainly did not stress the car, handling-wise, with my daughter along and driving unfamiliar roads &#150; but under all conditions the steering feel, response and the balance were confidence-inspiring. Dynamically, I find this BMW a near perfect blend of practicality and performance. I enjoyed almost the entire driving experience [ exceptions noted above ] and I am really looking forward to re-delivery here in [ says BMW ] 6 to 8 weeks.Why the 335iS? Having driven more than one 335i with Steptronic previously, I was most interested in the additional HP, and [ particularly ] the additional TQ and the 7-speed Dual Clutch Transmission of the &#145;iS&#146;. The handling poise of the 335 with a significant bump in acceleration and better gear shifting was enough to draw me in to test one. FWIW: I am quite satisfied with the &#145;iS&#146; &#150; and [ for acceleration and handling context ] my previous car was a Corvette.set full screen mode [ option bottom right &#150; and \ or F11 on firefox ] end enjoy http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v298/rayainsw/BMW%20Euro%20Deliv/?albumview=sl- ideshow "
"cdnpinhead","October 2011"," that was great. I've been to Europe several times and was able to absorb how things work at company expense during my first 3-4 visits; I can appreciate how hard it would have been to have taken such an ambitious journey as a maiden voyage. By the time I took my wife over I had a much better grip on things, one of which was when to ignore the GPS.I also enjoy the Swiss & Austrian Alps -- thanks for the descriptions & photos. I arrived last year too late to use some of the prettier passes, but there's always next time. Northern Italy may be on the agenda as well, given your great intro.Parking and using shanks mare & public transit has a lot to recommend it, though I find it hard to do with a rental that's costing a pretty penny each day it sits -- you didn't have that issue.Wow, just over a week ago. You'll have those memories forever. Thanks again for taking the time to share your trip in such detail. "
"fedlawman","October 2011"," Yes, thank you.I've never been to Europe but I've always wanted to go. I really enjoyed reading about your trip and looking at your pictures. "
"graphicguy","October 2011"," Yes....Thanks, Ray! What a great report. Maybe NYC can give us a report on driving his TSX around NY. :P Actually, I think the TSX is a sports sedan that appeals to a different demographic than some would think. I know my son's friends (all early 20s) love the TSX. Seems as if that feeling switches once that 30+ year old threshold has been passed.I've had a TSX loaner when I still had my TL in for service. They're really nice cars. Decent power....handle well.....relatively comfy.....lots of options as standard. "
"flightnurse","October 2011"," Very nice, I did the Euro Delivery of my 2005 330i Sedan with the ZHP package. Had a blast driving around Europe, my car has the nav system, I was able to get a copy of European DVD for the Nav system which made it very nice. I just bought a 2011 328i sedan with the M3 package and 6spd Manuel from a dealer. But we are going to get a 535i next spring and will do the Euro delivery on that car. Its going to be a nice trip.. "
"nyccarguy","October 2011"," Took the TSX ""out to the ball game"" on Friday night, watched 1.5 innings of baseball, then sat through an hour & a half rain delay until the game was postponed until Saturday night. The TSX's backup camera made street parking a snap. Took the TSX back to the game on Saturday night & saw one of the most amazing baseball games ever.I appreciate your candid thoughts on the TSX & tremendously respect your opinion. I'm sure your TL SH AWD would run rings around it. At the price point, it's not bad though. "
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," Ray, I have been looking forward to your write up. You did not let us down. I wonder why you stated you will probably never return? My wife and I have been to Germany about 25 times -- and we have taken the train from Munich to Venice (which goes through Verona) so many times we cannot remember, but each trip has always been better than the one before it. Breathtaking scenery, excellent sometimes food-gasmic meals (especially in Italy) -- the 5 course meals on the train trip to Venice are all Italian and all very nice, considering the food is on a train.We've stayed in Verona many times and we are fortunate enough to have access to a relatives apartment in Venice -- although we have stayed in many hotels in Venice, including the Danieli (worth saving up for.) We find virtually every part of Europe worth a return visit is the point. Why will you not be returning, pray tell?Loved the running commentary about the car, its transmission, tires, etc and even your reason for choosing it over others. Nice job!And, thanks!  "
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," I have been reading the endless running commentary apparently about the inclusion of the TSX in this discussion forum. I tend to agree the TSX doesn't fit in with the other cars -- I am on day three of having a loaner TSX while my TL gets backup sensors installed (I live in Cincinnati and the dealer is in Columbus, and I travel to Columbus every Saturday, so here I sit with a TSX and an '09 Audi A4 Prestige/Sport (tiptronic) at my disposal.)Over the weekend I drove both cars extensively -- I prefer the Audi, DUH! But the TSX was ""a very nice little car."" It seems outclassed by the other cars in this forum, but, I say let it stay here and let's not bash it. It seems the TSX is a fine machine, but is somewhat lacking in both lux and performance characteristics -- for MY taste.Let's move on, let's accept the fact that ALL of these cars are fine machines in their own right. They can't all be BMW's or Audi's or whatever your ideal is of an ELLPS. I think I have driven virtually all of the cars listed at the top of the page -- I like some better than others, but, overall I think they are ALL mighty fine.Since I just leased a new TL, I would assume you might think I am going to tell you how great the TL is and how it could kick your fill-in-the-blank car's butt. Maybe it could, maybe it couldn't. I didn't get it for that reason -- I got it because of its value. I may live to regret buying on that criteria -- I'll let you know.I will be turning in my Audi this week -- I will miss it. At 53,000 miles it feels like it is about a 20,000 mile old car -- and since the tires have plenty of tread, it still performs better than most cars on the highway. But, so does the TL SH-AWD Advance. While the Audi is ""better"" (as far as I am concerned) I just don't see that the price premium the Audi commands is justified. That is just me, perhaps -- I know that (finally) Audis are once again selling well, most reliability issues are behind it (I can testify, however, that I NEVER had reliability issues with 28 of my 29 Audis), its style always turns head and the driving experience is only rivaled by Infiniti and Acura -- and BMW, of course.Yet, you know, the S60 is the car I would have most liked to have leased for 36 months if there would have been ANY wiggle room in the S60 cap cost (which there was ZERO). If you have driven an S60 T6, you know what I am talking about -- it seems like a hell of a lot of fun. Truth be told, I thought the S60 T6 was more fun than a new 3 series X-drive flavor. The CTS too, had its merits, but one deal breaker -- no OMG handles for the driver or front-seat passenger (whose dumb idea was THAT?!?) I wouldn't take the CTS seriously for that one omission -- and for love nor money, you couldn't get blind spot warning on a CTS 4-door sedan (again, at this price point, in this class, a serious omission, specially when you can get a Taurus with it for pity's sake.)Anyway, I pretty much like or love most of the cars in this class -- they are the right size, the right power (usually) and make an old fart like me feel like I am driving something that can outperform virtually anything else on I-71 and I-75 here in the Big Town of Cincinnapolis.Drive it like you live.I'll sign off now, knowing I am often wrong, but NEVER uncertain.Mark :surprise: "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," Ray good recap . Always wanted to know what the process and experience with this program- it was a good break from the TSX bashing/ lovefest of the past week, and after reading this it also clarifies what lux and sport should be for me. It must be cool being able to explore the limits, something you can't do on the LIE. "
"billyperksii","October 2011"," Wow Mark, it takes the dealer that long to install the back-up sensors?I had mine plus the wood wheel and wood gear shift knob installed in a day. I had the 09 TSX as a laoner as well, nice car but not for me.I try to upgrade with every new car, the next one I get is going to be a beast, probably a V8 Mercedes.Secondly, I have learned that some of the posters on these boards, their words are just wind. They drive around in (mass production)RWD/AWD V6 and think that their car is special, you would probably think they own a RR Ghost or Phantom the way they rant. "
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," No, it takes one day to install the back-up sensors. I live in Cincinnati, the purchasing dealer (where I also purchased the sensors from, and incorporated them into the lease now that they can be capitalized) is in Columbus.100 miles separate these cities.I travel EVERY Saturday to Columbus. The arrangement was this -- drop off the car, pick up the loaner, then pick up the car the following Saturday. This, for better or worse, gives me the use of the TSX for about a week.I am able to note the Acura upgrades to what is essentially a Honda of some kind (people here say it is an Accord). The fit and finish and the interior are certainly somewhat upgraded over what you would get in a Honda.But, despite these upgrades and the requirements for premium fuel, the TSX doesn't, to me, represent an entry into the ELLPS crowd. But, as I said, live and let live, keep it in and we'll see what happens.I would think that the TSX would be ""naturally"" cross-shopped with an Audi A3 -- for instance. But, as I said, I cross shopped a 2012 TL SH-AWD Advance with an Audi A4 2.0T Prestige Tiptronic and, for fun, I drove a Premium Plus S4, more or less stripped of the lux bits and w/o the Sport Differential (Torque Vectoring). Also, I shopped the Acura against a CTS/4 Luxury Edition w/19"" wheels and paddle shifters as well as against a Volvo S60 T6 and against an Infiniti G37X/S and an M37X Premium+Tech. Having just come from a 2008 BMW (my wife's), I did not look at a 3 series, my German preferences satisfied with the A4 and/or S4.To me, these cross shopping adventures seem MOSTLY rational (the M37X is an outlier) -- I would not have considered a TSX anymore than I would have considered an A3, for instance.I drove my 2009 A4 Prestige with the 19"" sport package to work, yesterday -- today I drove the TSX in. I would say the differences were like Filet Mignon vs Laura's Lean hamburger patties. I like both of them, but prefer the filet, by far.I did test drive both of the Audis and the Acura on the same Saturday in June -- I also test-drove the CTS I mentioned. The Acura was, best I can describe, like an Audi AS4 quattro if such a model actually existed.Anyway, sorry to digress -- again -- but the back-up sensors are not taking this long, the issue is where I live vs where I bought. Once the sensors are in, I will either use a Cincinnati Acura dealer for service or I will take advantage of Lindsay Acura's Saturday service for things like oil changes and tire rotation, etc. "

"nyccarguy","October 2011"," About the slaughtering my TSX has taken lately. I'm going to somewhat agree with Sweendogy and say that my TSX is a ""Sporty Sedan"" instead of an all out ""Sports Sedan."" Considering some of the cars its being considered to by some posters here (no disrespect to anybody in particular), might not be entirely fair. A fully loaded up almost $50,000 A4 with Quattro, Sports Suspension, and Torque Vectoring Rear Differential. I would hope the Audi drives a whole helluva lot better. Same thing with a TL-SH AWD.The TSX V6 is too nose heavy to compete with anything in the class and you'd have to really hate the base TL to buy a TSX V6 with a similar MSRP (even though the V6 TSX is loaded with incentives most of the time).Where does the TSX go from here? You can't give it more power because it will torque steer like crazy. You can't give it Acura's SH-AWD because that will add weight and price.The TSX is a great car. I own one and love it. It has a taut suspension, adequate acceleration, fantastically supportive seats. It it fun to drive, gets good gas mileage...I'm happy with the decision I made to buy it. I've got over 41,000 miles on it after only 25 months. In a little less than 3 years it will be paid off and I'll hopefully be able to drive it relatively trouble free for well past the 100,000 mile mark.If there was never a cash for clunkers program, we drove our leased X3 for the entire 3 years and it had 60K miles instead of 45K for 3 years, would I have even set foot into an Acura dealership? Probably not. If something happened to my TSX today, would I get another one? I'm not so sure. "
"graphicguy","October 2011"," nyc.....in that mid $30s price range, I think the TSX is ""right there"" with the likes of an A4 or 328i (both discounted).I've taken a couple of stabs at liking Infinitis. None of them ever made it to the top of my ""want it"" list. I think they lack the refinement I got used to with Acuras, BMWs ,etc.The TSX should at least be given a look in the sport(y) sedan category based on the value equation. "
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," To get an Audi in the A4 body style WITH torque vectoring (aka Sport Differential), one would need to move up the ladder to the S4 -- and, typically, the one with the Sport Differential and Audi Drive Select, etc, etc, etc, will be closer to $60,000.I was very pleased to get an all tarted up TL Advance SH-AWD with accessories for under $48K -- and although it still isn't an S4, it presents itself very well in the class of cars we go on about here as well as being able to perform with near S4 capabilities.I'm still in my loaner TSX -- and wondering why Acura doesn't offer the thing with SH-AWD; seems it would be a killer car based on what -- a $2,000+ bump for the AWD? :confuse: "
"nyccarguy","October 2011"," I think be because the TL is the bread & butter of the Acura lineup. Acura probably doesn't want the ""lesser"" TSX to steal sales from the TL. The TSX is Acura's entry level car (that actually has more trunk space than the TL). They want you to buy (or lease) a TSX, then trade up to a base TL a few years later, then to a TL SH AWD not too long after that, & be so happy with the cars/brand that you buy (or lease) an MDX for your wife every few years.A V6 TSX Tech Stickers for high $30's. Add SH-AWD to that and you've got a close to $40K TSX. Maybe come trade up time you say ""I like my TSX SH-AWD, but don't think the TL SH AWD warrants the price jump."". Maybe you go look at Infiniti or BMW or MB...I'm not comparing the cars, but kinda like the reason Porsche messes with the Cayman's gearing and won't give it too big a motor to protect the 911. "
"tlong","October 2011"," The TSX V6 is too nose heavy to compete with anything in the class and you'd have to really hate the base TL to buy a TSX V6 with a similar MSRP (even though the V6 TSX is loaded with incentives most of the time).

IMHO where they should go from here is to the previous model TSX, which was great before they numbed and bloated it up. "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," Dido - the tsx was great in it's early form or even integra form. Value plus sport - newer models are bloated like Josh Beckett/ sired they perform good but will never beat a good team with the playoffs on the line. "
"nyccarguy","October 2011"," I agree the Acura is much more refined than the Infiniti. I had an opportunity to drive my Uncle's G37X sedan. Besides being an absolute road rocket, I was ultra impressed with the car's balance & handling. Felt like the car was turning on an axis. "
"graphicguy","October 2011"," nyc.....I've made a couple of stabs at testing a G. They're good cars. They kind of cover the gamut. The G25 targets the TSX, probably an A4 and a 328i. The G37 seems to target 335i. I believe the TL SH AWD is up the ladder a little from the G, however. While the G37 is fast, I feel my 335i is faster with more neutral handling and a better ride. Refinement in both the TL and the 3 are much higher than in the G.So, as mentioned before, the G tries to cover a lot of ground.My fear (and one of the main reasons I bought the '11 3) is that BMW is moving towards 4 cyl motors, at least in the lower 3s and 5s. Nothing inherently wrong with that. Audi's been doing that for years with their A4. But, some of us feel at that price point, a 6 cyl is the least we'd accept.Mark...I tried to find an S4 at both The Audi Connection and in Dayton. All they had were used ones. As you say, you get about 95%+ of an S4 in the TL SH AWD, for a whole lot less money. Interesting enough, the Cincinnati Audi dealer never seems to have much in the way of new cars....a few A4s, a few A6s....one A7 and a splattering of the Qs. Nothing that grabbed me. And, I went there probably 3-4 times over a 3-4 month period. The guys at Beechmont had 3-S4s, and a whole lot of A4s, but I just couldn't bring myself to pay a premium over my TL SH AWD when push came to shove.Now, if either of them had stocked an A5 or S5 (which they didn't), my decision might have been different. The only A5s they had were convertibles and I don't think the new S5 was out yet. "
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," The Audi Connection, in particular, seems to be adopting (not voluntarily) the European (at least the German) way of buying a car: visit dealer, look at the model you are interested in, get a brochure, place an order, wait. No instant gratification there -- here, on the other hand, we decide, ""let's go buy a new car. . .TODAY!"" and we're off to the races. We leave our houses late on a Saturday morning, go test drive a car or two and by the time the day is out, we've picked the car and while it is being prepped, we sign the paperwork and we end our day driving home in our new car -- we even stop at the grocery store on the way home and at a Chinese restaurant for some take out.Sometimes it almost seems we will invest more time buying a riding lawn mower at Lowes.The Germans, on the other hand, have to wait for the car (typically.)I was lucky that the AC had a basically stripped S4 in stock a few months ago (an '11). It didn't even have nav (at THAT price). It had the DSG tranny and it had, apparently, HUGE urge. It felt more, er, ""raw"" than either the A4 (non sport) or the TL, although at full cry the TL's 3.7L motor makes a pleasing sound (much better than the 4cyl of the A4 2.0T). The great thing about the Audi's is that they use FSI and are either Super or Turbo charged. Imagine for 30 seconds what the TL 3.7 SH-AWD would be like if it had a near zero lag turbo and was upgraded to direct injection and the same friction reducing steps that the 3.5L now enjoys.Acura -- should it choose to do so -- could offer, um, a ""TL/S"" with these upgrades, plus bi-xenons, better shoes, much better brakes (Brembo's with the cool looking caliper covers), full needle sweep on start-up and even better turn in. Perhaps it could move the AWD bias from 90/10 f/r to 50/50 and add a couple of visual cues beyond the ""/S"" on the trunk lid (subtle visual cues that only Acura aficionados would appreciate.) I'd probably suggest a model specific wheel too -- like the Advance 19"" wheel, only different.Perhaps this would add too much to the MSRP and the Acura Advantage (VALUE) would, for many, vanish and they would get the SLine A4 or the S4 or the Volvo S60 R Design, or even the Bimmer.I would argue if the changes were offered at reasonable prices (if the economics permit), there would be an audience for a more performance oriented TL. After all, look at the performance leanings of -- wait for it -- Lexus for pity's sake, LEXUS!Sir your High Performance La-Z-Boy is ready. Never thought THAT would happen!C'mon Acura -- you've clearly got some great engines (thinking of Indy cars, for example) in your DNA, let 'em out. Let My people go. :surprise: "
"flightnurse","October 2011"," The price of the G cars have gone up to a point that makes a BMW is better choice. For the price of my 2011 328i out the door, was the same price for a base G37, my 328 isn't a base car. So price was the advantage of the G car but that isn't happening today. So why would someone get a G37 when you can get a BMW for the same price... The BMW for me is a much more refined car then the G, and the Car mag's have stated the same thing. "
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," The G37, from a performance perspective, is more comparable to the 335, not the 328.Go on-line to Infiniti and select a G37 or 37X (and you can, if you like even go for the ""S"" models). Crank the options to 11 and you will find the G remains available with an MSRP that begins with a ""$4"" -- with a 328HP engine and Premium Package, Navigation Package, Sport Package, Technology Package, Interior Accents Packge, Rear Decklid Spoiler and Midnight Black Grille Package, Splash Guards, Stainless Steel Illuminated Kick Plates, LED Daytime Running Lights and Interior Accent Lighting all for an MSRP of: $46,940. This car IMHO is not comparable to a BMW 328.Now, I am not in any way suggesting that the BMW is not a ""superior"" vehicle (Car & Driver, despite loving the G, loves the BMW even more). Many magazine writers do opine that Infiniti's G37 and G37X are Japanese Bimmer competitors, but they almost always place the G in the #2 spot.Well, hell, try to equip the comparable BMW 3 (which has to be a 335) at the level of the G above -- it can't be done if one of the constraints is ""to keep the BMW's MSRP under $50,000.""Again, I am not suggesting that the BMW is #2 in this contest -- I am simply suggesting that a G equipped as above would show a 328 its tail lights and would be able to keep up with a 335, although the Bimmer would probably show the Infiniti it's butt quite a bit of the time.But if you're looking for VALUE, the Infiniti must be at the top of the list. A G37 (X or not) can be very well equipped and with its 3.7L motor and 7spd auto transmission can be both a comfortable commuter and, to use an over-used term, a pocket-rocket.For the price, the Bimmer just can't cut it, despite its many superior attributes -- remember, I said ""for the price.""Additionally, the G's have very very attractive lease programs -- often better than BMW's attractive programs. :shades: "

"fedlawman","October 2011"," ""I've taken a couple of stabs at liking Infinitis. None of them ever made it to the top of my ""want it"" list. I think they lack the refinement I got used to with Acuras, BMWs ,etc.""I think you hit the nail on the head.To me, Infiniti's seem like second rate BMW's. The G37 is fast and handles well, but they haven't nailed down the refinement.Acura, on the other hand, stays true to being a characteristically Japanese sport/luxury car. There's no attempt to try to be anything but what it is.By the way, is that you over at AVS talking about the 4311? "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," Hasnt nailed down refinement. - I agree not as refined as an Audi of BMW - and I do agree the Acura is more refined like lexas then the Infiniti G_ but interns of performance Acura has nothing compared to Infiniti. Acura stays true- sure they are true to compete with the Lexus Es. Not BMW. Sorry way wrong- they have not produced a car in 10 years that was sport- NsX died a long time ago so did the Acura ""sports"" claim. I would also wonder what Honda does with this brand- no hybrid, no coupe, no convert, no sports supercar, no flagship sedan- look at all the leaders, Audi, BMW, Lexus. They have all of these - Acura not one. This could be the next Oldsmobile. ( write that down) "
"smarty666","October 2011"," I agree, the price of the G has risen a little bit over the last few year, but I don't agree that the best bang for your buck is the BMW, yet that is. The G37 compares to the 335 and not the 328. If you did make the comparison you are, your 328i is going to lack almost 100hp, bi-xenon headlights, navigation, and a couple of other little toys and tech you only get in the 335 when ordered that your getting for the same price in the G37. I do agree though that the BMW is more refined then the G, but definitely not the best bang for the buck yet. I'm eagerly awaiting the next gen 2013 G and 3 series. It should be interesting to see what Infiniti and BMW do with their bread and butter vehicles. "
"kyfdx","October 2011"," Stopped by to look at the G series today.... we were a little too ragged out to drive one.... But, they have decent lease deals.. 39mo./39K lease on a G37X with premium pkg (MSRP about $41K) for $440/mo.+tax.. with around $900 total due at signing.. Add sport package for another $10/mo.That's better than Audi or BMW, right now.. and.. 328 HP... "
"flightnurse","October 2011"," Yes the G37 has 100 more HP, but as I wrote what I paid for my 328 is very close to the base price of a G37, there is no way you are going to get Nav, bi-xenon headlights or other goodies that I have on my 328 in that G37. The base price for a G37S is far more then what I paid for my 328i. Now if one wants to compare the average price of a 335i to a G37S the BMW is better value. "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," which base did you beat the G37 which is 37k even or the 41500 for a fully loaded G37S-- you lost me because you mentioned both..with haggling you can get a G for 2-4k off each car given the dealer. how much did you pay, was this a cpo?  does your car have the sports package, navi, rear camera like the G37s has?does your car have the headlights, sunroof, leather, and paint (500bux extra for Bmw) that the G37 base has?I dont have the avg price people are paying for the 335 or the G37S but given the options that are standard on the G its got to be close to 8k..maybe more--i own a G and want a 335- "
"m6user","October 2011"," Just did a quick build on each website and the 328xi comparably equipped(as I could get) was about $5k more than the G37x. Plus you get the +100hp to boot with the G. The 328 may be a little better driver and smoother runner but for value it's hard to beat the G. Infinitis are extremely reliable and trouble free for the most part. I have one(QX4) that is 9 years old and it has had only two repairs(exhaust resonator and power antenna) other than scheduled maint. "
"smarty666","October 2011"," Nah, they are taking 4k off a fully loaded G37 at my two local Infiniti dealers and I'll bet it is similar in discounts your received on your 328i so the G still in all trims is a better bang for your buck then the 328i. Also a G37 is fully loaded with nav, sport, etc for around 44k, before any discounts. It still undercuts the 335i in price. As almost all the 335i my local BMW has are priced in the high 40s to low 50s. The G even undercuts that price. I'm not saying the 328i or 335i are bad vehicles, in fact I really liked them when I test drove both but they still don't compare to the bang for buck of G. "
"wireless","October 2011"," Something I noticed this weekend when reading a somewhat favorable review of the 2012 Acura TL: They have a new 3.7L engine with 305 HP @6000 rpm and 273 pound-feet @5000 rpm. How is it that the MB C350 (pretty much the same price) has a 3.5L and it has 302 HP @6500 rpm with 273 pound-ft @3500 rpm. One thing I would give Honda is that they were always able to wring the HP out of their small engines even if they had to rev them to 9k rpms. Now they need an engine almost 6% larger just to match MB and the peak torque is at a relatively high 5k rpm. "
"flightnurse","October 2011"," I think you are assuming too much, each region is completely different when it comes to discount, rebates, leases and equipment. I know here on the west side of the country Infiniti is hurting for cars, so discounts are far and few. So when I do a comparison its done with the fact of what the prices were I live. The Base price for a G37 is $36K, and it does not come with Nav, now to add the Tech package to get Nav and Sport package is $41K. This was more then my 328 with M sport package. The G37 sport is 41K.. Just for the record my BMW is 328i with M sport package, with value package which includes leather, ipod connection (free) moonroof, and access entry, cost out the door was $37K. This includes 4yr 50K of free maintenance and service, I tend to run my BMWs hard and go through brakes, the clutch is covered under BMWs warranty so if needed, I wont have to pay anything, something Infiniti does not do. "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," good luck with the 328i nice car with the M package. If your looking at 6speed manuals which i love, btw, the infiniti fully loaded is 41k, there is not add on packages to get-whats in the box is in the box if you get the G with the manual.. and your right certain areas are offer different discounts BUT you have to remember BMW 3 series is changing for 2012 and the company wants all stock out the door. Now the maintenance is interesting... if you are like me and don't drive say 8-10k miles a year your looking at 1 tire rotation and 2 oilchanges a year- and if you are looking at somewhat equal cars (335) the 5-8-10k (whatever the dollar amt is) is not worth the free maintenace that all bmw owner crow about. Trust me I have the G and have spent 500 bux total in 4years- they run like tops. "
"graphicguy","October 2011"," Having test driven the G37x (coupe) and bought a 335i xDrive, I can say that the 3 has more HP than BMW is claiming. Plus, it's usable power, all through the rev range. The G is a good car. But, comparatively, the 335 is very easy to drive very fast. Still, not a bad car between the two.kyfdx...I had mentioned you can get BMW's factory performance upgrade for the 335 to add 20 HP for $600. I just got it done on Friday. Made an amazing car ""amaziner"".  "

"sweendogy","October 2011"," nice graphguy-- i would do 600 bux for an extra 20hp- -that seems like a good deal-- at 320 + claimed HP.. Thats some major power. but in reading articles its seems bmw is trying to move current inventory and using this as part of the bait to buy a 2011.. so it seems the 2012 335 will haven even more HP. Keep going BMW cant wait to get my next G with 400 hp or more.. "
"graphicguy","October 2011"," I debated the upgrade. I agree that BMW is readying for the new 3.But, 20 HP is 20 HP. I liked the car enough to buy it to begin with. I like it more now. "
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," At the price point and at the ""class"" (ELLPS) we are talking about, the value leaders remain Infiniti and Acura. More content and by some definition, I'm sure, more car for the money when you're comparing Infiniti to BMW (which seems to be the comparison that ""everybody"" makes); I think I'll compare Acura to Audi, for the time being -- it seems somehow to work for me.The G37XS was a car I wanted to like -- but I was smitten with the M37X which seems to me to be priced (lease price per month) at about what an Audi A4 2.0T Prestige goes for or what a BMW 335 (with x-drive and a fair amount of options) goes for. The G37XS after coming from an Audi A4 (2009 vintage) seemed ""cramped"" -- too narrow and with, apparently, no expanse of hood to speak of.Yet, the G was pretty well loaded and was very spunky -- gobs of power, albeit with a little harshness as the RPM's moved toward red-line (neither the Audi or BMW engine seem harsh.) Had the car been at least 2"" WIDER, I might have gone Infiniti rather than Acura. I certainly feel Infiniti, as a brand, has the LPS ""vision"" (whatever the hell THAT means) whereas neither Lexus nor Acura seem to have much of a clue.But, I got behind the wheel of the TL Advance and it WAS wider, I could see a hood out through the front window and there was no harshness in the engine compartment and the sound of the 3.7L at full cry is quite pleasing. Too bad the TL isn't quite as quick feeling as the G -- but man, the TL has the G in smoothness -- the TL is like butta!I am growing, slowly, very slowly, to accept the looks of the TL (exterior), I am pleased with the interior -- the seats are almost Audi quality and they are ventilated (a must have, I am almost embarrassed to say.)The TL is -- on paper -- damn near the perfect definition of an ELLPS (but ONLY in Advance trim or Tech trim with a 6 speed, based on reviews -- and ONLY if it is SH-AWD equipped.) Here's a 1,500 mile review:Smooth and quiet: checkFeels bigger than it is: checkIs, technially, bigger than some of the others in this class: check, checkBest factory sound system ever: checkVery quick, very responsive transmission (especially with the paddle shifters): checkThick, meaty steering wheel, great ""sporty"" seats: check, checkFeature set is at least as good as the other ELLPS's: checkTorque Vectoring reduces (a lot) the sensation of understeer: checkDecent Gas Mileage (combined 26 according to the center display): check (this thing is almost stingy with gas, in fact): checkAnd the list of positive attributes could go on and on.I do like driving the TL -- very much -- I don't regret getting it, especially at $499/mo plus tax, and, so far, the dealer seems terrific (Lindsay Acura, Columbus, Oh.)However, the sum of its parts pretty much equals, er, the sum of its parts. Audi and BMW (and I'll assume Mercedes) somehow seem to imbue their cars with ""something"" that makes them feel like MORE than the sum of their parts.It's not that the TL seems flimsy or not stiff and firm -- it does. But there is something that is lacking -- something that a new A4 Prestige Sport or a new 335 x-drive will have and you will notice instantly. In some ways, for the price, the TL outdoes (content wise) both Audi and BMW by a wide margin. In other ways, the TL seems like the best damn appliance Electrolux ever made -- take it away Kelly Ripa! 34 payments to go. . . :surprise: Klikie Klikie :blush: "
"graphicguy","October 2011"," Mark....you and I have the same tastes and opinions. I agree with your entire assessment. Although, I liked the styling of the TL. It was bold, and not to be confused with anything else. That was a winner in my book.Who knows, another TL may grace the GG estate in the future. It just won't be in the near future.Have fun with your TL. Sounds like you're really starting to enjoy it. "
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," Mine is pearl white -- and since it is a 2012, the beak is pretty much subdued to begin with and in white, the effect of the beak reduction is even more so.From the side with a slight angle so that you can see just a part of the front end, the thing looks good -- not great, but good. The changes to the rear were just what the doctor ordered too -- I don't really have too many complaints.Overall the styling has risen to ""OK"" -- and when I'm behind the wheel on a twisty road with the transmission selector set to ""S"" and using the paddle shifters like I know what I'm doing (I don' really, of course), I have a big stupid grin on my face -- I'm already planning on new UHP super sticky tires to replace the kind of tepid tires the thing came with.I'll bet new shoes will further transform my ugly duckling into. . .an only slightly homely swan? :confuse: "

"markcincinnati","October 2011"," Acura chose a tire, I know not why, that has the distinction of being High Performance, not Ultra High Performance. It is an all season V rated Goodyear RS-A -- it has a tread wear of 240 or 280 or something pretty low for such a low-er performance tire. "
"shipo","October 2011"," Yikes! Goodyear Eagle RS-As? Utter and complete crap in every sense of the word. :sick: Those worthless donuts came from the factory on my current car and I had them yanked when there was only 714 miles showing on the odometer. I replaced them with a set of Michelin Pilot Sport A/S tires, and the immediate improvement in the handling and precidtiblity of my car was beyond my greatest expectations.If you look around on the net you'll find any number of makes and models where Goodyear suckered the manufacturer into using the RS-A; the last time I checked the only positive reviews coming from any car community are remarks from the folks driving the Ford Crown Victoria shod with the RS-A. Not much of a ringing endorsement if you ask me. :P Long story short, if you like your car now, you'll absolutely love it later, if and when you give it some new shoes. :shades: "
"smarty666","October 2011"," The RS-As are utter crap as a tire. They came on my Maxima and Nissan and Infiniti liked to use them on a lot of things. They used to come standard on the M, but at least they came to their senses after people complained and now the M comes with Primacy MXM4s. "
"shipo","October 2011"," Funny thing, when I got my current car in the fall of 2008 the RS-As were way-way expensive, like twice the price of the vastly superior Michelin Pilot Sport A/S I replaced them with. Fast forward three years and they are literally less than half of the price they were back then (while the Michelin's have gotten much more expensive, and rightly so).I cannot imagine what questionable business tactics Goodyear used to sell so damned many of these horrible tires to the vehicle manufacturers of the world. FWIW, you can add Mazda and Volvo to the list of companies which got suckered into buying the RS-A. "
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," Not defending the tires, but the TL uses a ""new formulation"" RS-A. I still think they are crap, too, but there is something that allowed Goodyear to call them NEW.Perhaps it is whatever has to be done to change their rating from H to V?? "
"shipo","October 2011"," If I'm not mistaken, the Eagle RS-As that came on my car carried a ""V"" rating back in 2009. That said, I'll probably never be able to prove it one way or another as I was able to sell them within a week of having them yanked off of my car. "
"billyperksii","October 2011"," Mark- drove my wife's 04 accord to work today, guess what- they have grab handles!!!!I guess everyone has their little gripes-me, I would never buy any car with less than a 245 18 tire size. I just like that wide looking stance. "
"shipo","October 2011"," Yeah, why bother having a car with superior handling dynamics when you can have one which looks good? :P "
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," My TL has 245 x 40 x 19""'s which seem adequate -- or, better said, would be adequate if the tires were at least UHP's.I assume Acura chose the RS-A's for two reasons:#1 They got a deal from Goodyear, and#2 Customers didn't care for the Summer Only rubber that Acura had chosen previously.Too many folks here and on all the other ""purpose"" sites [non-permissible content removed] and moan about the dearth (and death) of manual transmissions. Yet manufacturers, like Acura, in this case, offer them up and 1-3% of their customers acutally buy them. If I were the manufacturer, I would seriously consider dropping something THAT unpopular unless there was virtually no cost to keep them at least in the brochure (since very few dealers will ever stock one of them.)Likewise, other good deeds don't go unpunished -- my 2009 Audi A4 with the 19"" sport package came with Max Performance Dunlops -- SUMMER only tires. My dealer claims they never stocked the A4 with that sport package because the customers kept the summer tires on year 'round and had drivability issues or tire damage issues, etc. So, no mo' UPH or higher rated tires, typically -- because of customer disatisfaction. And, for the most part it is hard to find a car in this price range that doesn't come with A/S shoes.The list of other options or combination of options that manufacturers try to bring to the buying public that no one buys keeps on comin' -- so to combat this, the manufacturers bundle as much content as they can (or as they dare) into base, plus and max packages and pretty much disallow a la carte selection.Those that do allow you to add individual options often require that you first pony up for plus or max packages before they let you add your individual choices of extras. Case in point, to get the 19"" wheel/tire sport package on an Audi A4, I first had to agree to buy the A4 configured as a Prestige model. No 19"" wheels for the proletariat.Acura pissed me off -- a bit -- by not allowing me to select the blind spot warning system unless I went with the Advance designation; now that I have the Advance, I am glad, since I also got the 19"" wheels (albeit with crappy tires) and ventilated (heated AND cooled) seats along with the BSW system.Of course every manufacturer here in ELLPS land seems to want you to buy off the lot, rather than order the car and wait for it to be made exactly to your specifications. Hence, we get essentially only two or three ""package"" choices.I'd like to see more than one tire choice offered to those willing to wait for their cars to be built; I'd also like to have a greater choice of interior and exterior color choices. Why is it that I couldn't get pearl white paint and the umber leather interior, but I could get crystal black with umber? Who's dumbass rule is that anyway?The list of incomprehensible rules regarding how we can configure a $45,000+ car never ceases to amaze. I guess there would have to be some rules -- especially since most of these cars are leased (the residual value of a purple car with a white leather interior would be, after all, low, lower, lowest) -- but if the customer is willing to pay for something (not a one off, mind you) that you are already offering -- just not in that combination -- TAKE THE CUSTOMER's MONEY for pity's sake!Why are back-up sensors NOT a factory option on an Acura TL? My dealer broke the rear bumper (which is, essentially, plastic) trying to install them (since the bumber has to be drilled), then after the bumper was repaired, the bumper had to be specially repainted since I had to be so lucky as to have pearl-effect paint (137 coats or some such thing).The dealer didn't make any money on THAT transaction -- and even they wonder why such a popular option on this class of car is not standard equipment (within the technology or advance packages) or at least a FACTORY installed option.Where was I? What time is it? Oh yeah -- who in the wide, wide world of sports decided to put RS-A's on the top o' the line TL?Drive it like YOU live! :surprise: "

"graphicguy","October 2011"," mark....billy....I have a dealer who I buy my Acura products from (if I'm in the market for an Acura). Any year, any color combo, any equipment level, any model. If they have to find one for me, they will. The deal is a skinny one.Then again, I've bought 3 Acuras from the same dealership, same sales person. It's really simple dealing with them and I always get a good deal.Same way with BMWs. I go to the same dealership, deal with the same salesperson (who's been there for 24 years). If they don't have what I want, they'll do their best to find it (a little bit harder with BMWs, it seems). Again, they always do a skinny deal with no hassle. And, I've also bought multiple BMWs from them.I've never been able to deal with either the local Infiniti dealer, nor the local Audi dealer. Neither likes to do skinny deals...no matter how easy the deal would be.However, driving 50-75 miles in either direction of me, and the Infiniti dealers and the Audi dealers are more than happy to make skinny deals.Go figure.Mark...you know the dealerships (Audi Connection, Infiniti of Cincinnati) I'm talking about. I don't even bother shopping the local Audi dealership anymore when I'm in the market. They don't have a good selection, and all they want to do is order what you might want (or seek it out from another dealer). Then, they make you wait to get it, all the while offering little in the way of a discount for your trouble. The Infiniti dealer usually has good stock, but doesn't seem to like to get skinny on a purchase (Audi and Infiniti dealerships owned by the same principal). Maybe their focus is on leasing. But, I'm a purchase customer, not a lease customer.That diamond white paint on the TL is super expensive. I had to have body work done on my diamond white TL and the shop that did the work said it was a multi-step process, and hard to get right. Hand it to Acura to pull off such a feat on a production car. It is stunning looking, however.billy...I liked that umber interior. I almost bought one with that color. My Acura dealer mentioned that whenever they have those cars with that interior color, they were hard to sell. So, I figured (rightfully or wrongfully) that the umber might ding it come resell time.Mine had ""stone"" interior, which I liked quite a bit, too.  "
"graphicguy","October 2011"," me...I have ""park distance control"" (PDC)on my 3. I like it....more than I liked the back-up camera on my TL. I can get within 12-18 inches of another car or garage wall just by watching the park distance control in the NAV screen.It was harder to judge distance with the back up camera.I'm certain you have to have BMW's iDrive to get PDC. But, I've never seen an option to add it as a dealer accessory. Call your dealer and ask them. "
"billyperksii","October 2011"," I actaully wanted parchment but the AWD Tech did not offered it in2009.My little ones would have scuffed up the stone, I am in the act of ordering the rear seat covers probably this week. "
"graphicguy","October 2011"," Billy....if i still had small children, i probably wouldn't have gone for stone interior. I do like that umber, regardless of its impact on trade-in. It can't be that bad given Acura has offered it for several years. "
"me0000","October 2011"," Ok, so I have narrowed down to either the 328iX Premium Nav or the TSX 4 cylinder Tech. I can easily calculate the price difference but would appreciate any and all comments of the pros/cons comparing those two. It's too late for write-in votes for other cars. thanks in advance for any and all thoughts! "
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," The BMW would get my vote (and my money). Is the TL SH-AWD not comparble, in price, to the BMW?I got 13% off sticker on a TL SH-AWD Advance -- seems it would be the Acura to compare the 328 X-drive to.I thought the TSX to be a somewhat tinny car -- as if it is out of its league when compared with the others here. The AWD on the BMW would sell me, though. "
"nyccarguy","October 2011"," I own a TSX and as great a car as it is, you cannot go wrong with a 328xi. "
"fedlawman","October 2011"," Why are you comparing a 4WD BMW to a 2WD Acura? Wouldn't a 328i be a closer match? "
"me0000","October 2011"," TSX not available in AWD, expect FWD to do much better wet/snow than RWD 328, and small RWD-AWD 328 payup. "
"flightnurse","October 2011"," I would go for the BMW, for two main reason first the Free maintenance and bumper to bumper warranty for 4yr/50K. Second better resale value, sooner or later you will get a new car, the BMW will hold its value.Why are you looking at the TSX if AWD is important to you? "
"tlong","October 2011"," IMHO you buy the BMW if you want a driving experience, vault-like feel of the car, and brand cachet.You buy the TSX if you like electronic goodies, decent handling, and outstanding reliability.In the BMW you give up great reliability, and if you keep it longer than the warranty period you are looking at very expensive repairs when they are needed.In the Acura you give up the German driving feel and vault-like construction.In my own experience (Audi vs. Acrua), when I had the Audi I found its reliability and service frustrating, but LOVED the driving feel and interior quality. Now with the Acura, I love the reliability and smooth cruising, but really miss the German car quality and driving.Whichever one I had, I wanted the features that the other one had. :surprise: "
"nyccarguy","October 2011"," I would say the 328 gives up nothing to the TSX as far as reliability goes. The E90 3 series platform has been around since 2005. My Mom had an '08 328xi that never went into the shop for anything other than scheduled maintenance. Yes she had to put brakes on at 50,100 miles & pay for an Inspection II @ 58,000 miles, but nothing ever broke.In my experience, you CANNOT compare Audi & BMW when it comes to maintenance & repairs. I'm not saying BMWs are perfect, they've had problems with the N54 Twin Turbo  "
"andres3","October 2011"," My view on BMW 3 series is that if you can't spring for the good one (335ix) then get the TSX/TL, G35, A4, or whoever else your looking at. Acura's have great resale value as well, not far from BMW, so that's almost a nonfactor.If you are planning on keeping it a long time, I'd bet on the Acura costing you a lot less in both maintenance and repairs. "
"andres3","October 2011"," In my experience, you CANNOT compare Audi & BMW when it comes to maintenance & repairs. I'm not saying BMWs are perfect, they've had problems with the N54 Twin Turbo I've heard a lot more anecdotal evidence that is BAD for BMW reliability in the last 5-7 years than I have for Audi. That being said, if you maintain either properly, you should have a fairly reliable car by any standard (and it helps if you avoid lots of add-on options, as those tend to be the trouble spots). My Audi has been relatively reliable for the 83,000 miles I've driven it since 2006. Perfect no, bothersome, no. If your looking for bulletproof NEVER have to take it back to the dealer, the answer is Acura more often than not. "
"shipo","October 2011"," ""My view on BMW 3 series is that if you can't spring for the good one (335ix) then get the TSX/TL, G35, A4, or whoever else your looking at.""Seriously? You consider a 328i a ""Bad"" BMW? Geez, silly me; I'm thinking a 328i (or better yet the 2.0 liter turbo F30 model which is slated to be the 328i replacement) is pretty much the perfect BMW for me. Why? Given that my 2002 530i SP 5-Speed was so close to absolutely perfect for my needs, wants, and desires, and given that the E90 and the F30 are almost spot on in every metric, but with a bit more leg room, a tad more power and slightly less weight, the ""Bad"" 3-Series couldn't be more ""Gooder"" for me (unless we&#146;re blessed with something like a 6-Speed manual 325d on this side of the pond).  "
"nyccarguy","October 2011"," Even the heaviest 328xi (AWD & Automatic) is a very entertaining car to drive. I agree 100% with shipo's comments. The F30 328i (2.0T) with a 6-speed stick is going to make it very hard to keep my ""pay off the TSX in 5 years & drive it until it is 10 years old"" promise to myself. "
"2233","October 2011"," Acuras in general are not bulletproof. The transmissions on the TL and MDX have been terrible with some on their second and third transmissions.I do not know if this applies to the TSX but Acura's two best sellers, the TL and MDX have had problems with the trannies for many years. "
"tlong","October 2011"," I do not know if this applies to the TSX but Acura's two best sellers, the TL and MDX have had problems with the trannies for many years. Well my '05 TL has 113K bulletproof miles on it to date. Of course anything could happen tomorrow, and one car doesn't make a statistic. But I suspect the problems are only noteworthy because of how reliable the Acuras are. If it were a GM or Chrysler nobody would even notice. "
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," This thread is more than a tad interesting since I, for one and apparently MORE than one, seem to find some surprise that the TSX and a 3 series BMW (even though it is the ""bad"" one) merit cross-shopping.The TL SH-AWD seems like the obvious choice to cross shop an AWD BMW 3 series with, assuming one must cross shop an Acura and a BMW.But, of the choices offered up in this thread, I would find the Audi 2.0T quattro with the pre-paid maintenance (or perhaps the Volvo S60 T6) to be even more of an apples-to-apples comparison worthy of cross-shopping. Then I look at my recent purchase of a TL, after 29 Audis in a row, and knowing what I cross shopped, well maybe I see the rationale of shopping for both a BMW 3 X-drive and a TL SH-AWD (but never a TSX.)Having had three AWD BMW's since 1988 (in addition to the 29 Audi's), there is no comparison between the BMW and the TSX in terms of the ""feel-behind-the-wheel"" -- and, moreover, in winter, four driven wheels are much better than two, even if those two are the fronts.Although not comparable to the BMW in terms of the ""ultimate driving experience"" the TL SH-AWD does a better imitation of an Audi A4 2.0T quattro Prestige than any other Japanese car I test drove. In fact the TL SH-AWD Advance (which adds 19"" wheels and tires) actually felt pretty competent compared with an 2011 Audi S4 Premium+.Given the two choices you offered up for us to weigh in on, the TSX is only comparable to the BMW in that they both have four wheels -- the BMW is THAT much better. :confuse: "
"flightnurse","October 2011"," Please point me in the direction for proof of your comment about the tranny problems on the TL and MDX's. I have never owned a TL or MDX, but have friends who have/had and not one had a transmission problem. "
"Kirstie_H","October 2011"," If you look to the right, you'll see a keyword search box for the forums.Try ""acura transmission.""The first two discussions that are listed (in order of most recent activity) are those for the MDX and the TL. "
"billyperksii","October 2011"," Obviously this poster has been out of the loop for quiet some years now.The tranny problems he is talking about were on the 2001-2003 TL's.I had to replace mine twice on my 2003 TL Type S. "
"m6user","October 2011"," People purchase cars for different reasons and just because they want a somewhat sporty sedan they may not NEED or even want the greatest ""feel behind the wheel"". They may be shopping price and size as the most important factors on their heiracrchy of needs. The TSX is a lot more similar in size/weight to the 3 than the TL is. They may want good winter traction but not neccesarily the best. While front wheel drive isn't quite as good as all wheel drive is pretty adequate especially if you use snow tires in the winter. Stepping up to the TL SH-AWD is also quite a jump in price from the TX. About 10K or so and about 3K more than the 3ix. The TL SH-AWD is also about 500 lbs heavier than the TSX. The TL is 16"" longer than the BMW....that is a lot. While it may not drive that much heavier it is still a much larger car and many people just don't want that much metal to manuever around. I like the G37 but would get it in ""X"" form because of winter traction. If I bought a TL, the front wheel drive would be adequate without having to jump up in price. Don't really care about the extra HP or being able to take hairpins at speed. Your car buying criteria may be different than others looking at the same class of auto....nothing wrong with that. So it is not wrong to cross shop the TSX with the BMW 3, it is completely right for many people.By the way, I enjoyed your suggestions for improvement over on the 2012 TL thread. Very in depth on the pros and cons. "
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," Thanks for the compliment -- it is just that Acura seems SOOOO CLOSE to producing really interesting cars, close but not quite there yet. Acura is now, in my ""often wrong, never uncertain"" opinion, where Volvo was a very few years ago. Then the S60 comes along and Acura slips to where Volvo used to be -- no interesting cars, just very good ones that are probably about as reliable and durable as humans know how to build (at these prices.)I could not advise anyone to choose the TSX over the 3 X-drive, the differences are not subtle.But again, I come from the viewpoint: often wrong, but NEVER uncertain.Drive it like YOU live, not like I live!!! :shades: "
"shipo","October 2011"," Of course there are those few of us wackos that, in spite of living in an area which features hilly terrain and which can receive over ten feet of snow in any given winter, we still prefer RWD as opposed to any other drive configuration.

"graphicguy","October 2011"," Equipped like for like, the 328i xDrive is going to come in close to a TL SH AWD. Between those two, I'd take the TL.Now, if you're moving up the ladder into a 335i xDrive, that's a different story. "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," I'm glad we all agree the tsx should be moved from this thread once and for all. It's a 4cy fwd and bloated.

"markcincinnati","October 2011"," I have been trying to say this -- thanks. The price of the 328 X-Drive (if not the dimensions) is competitive with the 328 or the Audi A4. I configured both an Audi A4 2.0T Prestige with the sport package, added wood and sunshades and found the A4 and the Tl SH-AWD Advance (plus back up sensors) to both be about $47,000. A similar exercise with the 328 X-Drive equipped as close as possible to the TL coughs up similar numbers. Not so with the TSX and the 3 comparo.Now having finally gotten this data point out, the only merit in considering the TSX is if ""low price"" is #1 on the criteria list. "

"m6user","October 2011"," All. Hardly. Speak for yourself, please. This is a public forum and Edmunds decided to include the TSX in this discussion and if you want to change it why don't you become a host.You say the TSX doesn't belong because it is 4cyl, fwd and bloated. Well the A4 is 4cyl, fwd and about exactly the same price in base form and and is almost exactly the same size but actually weighs more than the TSX. Who is bloated? Just because you can get it in quattro means little. For the same price you can get the TSX w/ a V6(not all that great IMO but doable) and blow the doors off the A4.So I guess if the TSX has to go so should the A4. "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," is this was 2002 when this forum started sure the TSX was right to be included-- but in looking at the group now (its 2012) the TSX has added nothing in terms of power and have added weight... Sure you can get a V6 but how many people are buying this car with the 6? Zero why?? well the price advantage goes away, not to mention its sportier nature with the additional weight, and to say the tsx v6 would blow away the audi doyou know the audi has more torque then the tsx v6?? you and edmunds were right about 10 years ago, but not today, sorry man "
"Kirstie_H","October 2011"," You're welcome to debate the issue all you want, but the TSX is staying, even if you say yet another time that it shouldn't be included. "
"me0000","October 2011"," I have to agree that the TSX belongs here. i just bought the 328iX over the TSX but it was a very close call. Yes, the cost differential weighed in the TSX's favor but that was not the only factor in its favor. Comparing ""luxury sedans"", features were also factors and, at present, the TSX has some features the 328 doesnt just as the 328 has some the TSX lacks. While I expect the 2012 328 to cover the some of the feature gaps at a higher cost, the TSX deserves due consideration. It's a great vehicle. In the end, after considering the Mercedes C, a couple of Lexus sedans, the 328, and the TSX, I narrowed it down to the TSX and the 328. Unfortunately for Audi and Volvo, I considered neither because of dealer location and reputation. Thanks to all for your thoughts and feedback. Despite my opinions, I respect those that say the TSX doesn't belong here. In my humble opinion, however, I believe it does.Now, however, I am looking forward to the arrival of my 328iX. "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," I understand that this is an agrument that I will lose as soon as the host comments but why not a Volvo s60 which was just updated, and has been marketed as a competitor to the cars on the right. My point is this was started 10 years ago and why not reshuffle the deck once a decade? "
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," Holy cow! I assumed the S60 was in this group -- until I double checked the top of the screen and saw no S60.Is this an oversight -- we can debate until the cows come home the relevance of the TSX, but if the S60 is not here and the A4 and 3 and C class are, where in the world would the S60 be if not ELLPS? :confuse: Finally IMHO there is no comparison of an A4 with a TSX that can withstand any serious examination -- now, then, compare an A3 vs TSX or a ""Deluxe"" Jetta or perhaps a new Passat with a TSX, sure. But, sure, go ahead keep it here as an outlier.  "

"flightnurse","October 2011"," Reason why the S60 isn't talked about much is the fact the car redesign makes a statement in style, some people might not think of it as a contender. However this is changing, and soon it will be talked about. For me when I looked at buying my 328 I looked at Volvo on the same night I looked at the A4. The interior space on the S60 seemed smaller then the A4 for more money. Also the car isnt that sporty even in sport trim. "

Just like the midsized sedans forum there are many more midsize family sedans than there is spaces to the right. What this means, and I'm shocked that long time posters don't know this, is that there are other cars not listed that can and probably should be included in discussions. The host can correct me if I'm wrong.So the S60 certainly can be included in the discussion IMO as well as the 9-5(at least for now???) and possibly others.And of course I know the A4 has more torque. Some family sedans have more torque than the A4 so I hardly think that should be the only qualifier. "

"Kirstie_H","October 2011"," That's exactly the issue - limited space. I believe at the time, models were chosen based on the higher-volume sellers or those for which we see the most consumer traffic/interest in the forums. The list isn't meant to be all-inclusive or limiting regarding what vehicles you can discuss - as long as the vehicle reasonably fits into the ELLPS class, it's fine to talk about.Looking at the list, it seems we could replace the Mercedes C-Class with the Volvo S60. It *has* been updated - I remember taking out the G35 and replacing it with the G37. "
"m6user","October 2011"," True or they could even replace the TSX as they already have the TL listed from Acura. That would satisfy all the people that seem to have a hang up with the TSX(they wouldn't see it displayed) but we can still discuss as a viable alternative. All these cars don't have to perform exactly alike or be priced the same to be in the same class. There always has to be a starting point in any category and I would suggest the TSX is that starting point. Is it as fast, handle as well, etc etc as many of the others? No, but it still belongs in the mix. "
"fedlawman","October 2011"," I would rather see the S60 take the place of one of the Lexus sedans. They are much more redundant than the TSX and TL. "
"Kirstie_H","October 2011"," I agree - no sense in listing two very similar models. Most of our discussions across the forums about the IS250/IS350 are combined anyway, and it's not that much of a high-traffic model. "
"m6user","October 2011"," I have no vested interest so I don't care much which cars are mentioned in the heading. I fail to see the big deal in all of this. All ELLPS are welcome for discussion as the host stated....whether they are listed or not. But listing a car that doesn't get much attention may be good thing as it would generate some discussion about it. "
"renssils","October 2011"," After driving my 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD with Advance package and automatic transmission for 8,000 miles, I can make a few observations. The car has been reliable, though lately it rattles, perhaps from the sunroof. The seats are comfortable. The HVAC and in-car electronics are excellent. On the highway it gets about 27 miles a gallon; in town, about 17 miles a gallon. The engine and transmission are both quiet and smooth.Within 250 miles of my getting the TL at the end of April 2011, I bought a set of four Continental ContiExtreme DW summer tires, which are so much better than the OEM Goodyear tires. The TL on the Conti tires is fun to drive! The Contis stick like glue, are quieter, and smoother riding. Today in anticipation of winter, the Goodyears were installed on the TL; the Contis will be stored until next April. I will miss the Contis. I recall that the Goodyear tires were noisy, rough riding, and had low limits of adhesion. I hope that they'll perform well in shallow snow.I've owned several high-performance all-wheel-drive sedans including a 2001 Audi A6 4.2 sport, a Subaru SVX, which is my all-time favorite, and two Subaru Legacy spec.B sedans. I was inclined to get a new Audi S4, but chose the TL after driving a BMW 535ix, Volvo S60 T6, and Infiniti M37x. The TL seemed to be the best all-around vehicle. The TL was appreciably less costly to lease than the other cars. The TL delights in many ways, but disappoints in some ways. The forward visibility is atrocious. Thick, raked A-pillars create huge blind spots; turning left or right always seems risky. Rear visibility is severely limited. The back up camera has primitive software and furthermore rain on the camera's lens reduces its utility. The trunk is oddly shaped and small for a 194-inch long car; if you don't lift the trunk deck as high as it will go, its pointed bottom lip will stab you. The only clock is an inch-long digital display buried in a panel near the radio buttons. The navigation system's system has irritating quirks that should have debugged long ago. The car would benefit from a reduction in window and road noise.The TL is so close to being a fine car, but I wouldn't buy it or any car ever again with small windows, high belt line, and atrocious visibility. "
"robbieg","October 2011"," I would think that in the real world few people actaully want a ""performance car"". Most people want a slush box and not a stick. Furthermore, at least in my next of the woods, people don't want a RWD BMW or Mercedes. They want AWD so it goes in the snow. In short, performance isn't that big of a deal. The TSX is every bit as sporty as a CTS or the S60 if not more so. It seems people in this forum, which I have read on and off for years, care about a manual transmission and rear wheel drive. Well, few if any of those cars are sold in my area. Most BMWs are x-drive and with only a few manuals are actually sold. "
"andres3","October 2011"," I'll agree the TSX belongs. If only for it's quality interior appointments and exacting assembly from Japanese artisans. I found it to be ""tighter"" than the USA built TL a few years back (previous generation models). I had a 2003 Accord V6 and it's interior was best in class in my opinion, but the TSX clearly goes beyond anything Honda has or had in luxuriousness of the interior. I haven't driven a TSX so I can't speak on that, but I'm very familiar with the way Honda's drive, and would say that Honda/Acura have mastered the art of sporty FWD cars. FWD can be great when engineered correctly for sport and performance.I currently drive a FWD Audi A3, and can say that Honda/Acura/Audi/VW are in their own league when it comes to sporty FWD performance.I don't think anyone can touch them on Front Trak/FWD. If your goal is to be fast, FWD can work. If your goal is to do powerslides and drift, FWD is a problem.I think in the future I will prefer AWD. Absent the weight penalty, AWD rocks. "

I bought my car in November of 2008, two days before a light dusting of snow, and the RS-As proved to be as bad in the snow as the Michelin Pilot Primacys which came on my last BMW (with the Sport Package which features summer tires).Fortunately I'd been forewarned about the RS-As and already had a set of Pilot Sport A/Ss on order, and once they were installed after 714 miles, I sold the (virtually new) Goodyears for something like thirty cents on the dollar (and was happy to get that much for them).

"sweendogy","October 2011"," mark - good post-- something ive been saying for years- the acura line as we know it has not life and needs to be revived. Its been past by both lexus (luxury) and infiniti (sport) and no where near the germans. Where is the NSX, the integra, or the legend.. Cars are recycled from the parent acura line, like oldsmobile used to do with chevy cars.. olds no longer exists -for good reason. Acura needs to get the game back on, i agree, where is the passion for driving.sure they build a nice sedan that will last 10 years but.. sorry boys with the TSX and the TL's-- your cars are fine autos but not sports sedans.. (HOSTS its time for a change to this category, i mean its been 10 years, get rid of the TSX, keep the boring TL and add a Volvo, i mean do the math ELLPS its in the price range, produces more power, has awd and has been talked about for months-its 2012 not 2002) "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," why not say this a year ago when it was first mentioned ? I mean its been pretty well know by all the TSX should be moved lower in the class due to the fact that it has less power, is fwd, and has never been mentioned by magazines that we all read as being a player in the group?- the posters of the blog should be heard.. "
"tlong","October 2011"," ... the posters of the blog should be heard.Personally, I've seen it repeated many times that the TSX belongs in this discussion, yet SOME poster just can't let that lie.....I wonder why? Nobody is forcing anybody to buy the car. :surprise: "

"andres3","October 2011"," I will say that there was an Integra at the track, and it kept up with me in my A3 (with some mods too) and I'm a pretty fast student driver.Of course, I let him pass once, and then he proceeded to spin out and get about 6"" deep in the dirt n' gravel on the very next turn as I stayed right behind him, but for a lap or two, he stayed with me.Didn't Edmund's Inside Line recently show a ten year old RSX ran circles around a 2010 Civic Si.Haven't seen a TL or TSX at the track yet. "
"andres3","October 2011"," test drive. I'm talking a serious test drive where you can really drive the car, probably to the point where most car salesman wouldn't want to go along for the ride? "
"qbrozen","October 2011"," Just tell them that's what you want to do. Explain you need to take it out for probably an hour or more so you can be sure. Doubt a salesman will want to spend an hour riding along with you.If they do insist on going along, I go ahead and do what I would do as if they weren't there. It is their own damned fault. "
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," I have found that LPS and ELLPS car dealer salesreps virtually never go along for the test drive -- assuming the car you show up with at the dealership is already in the same class or that the car is at least fairly new and you don't look like something the cat dragged in.If you show up at the dealership with your significant other, too, I can bump that up to ""the salesrep NEVER goes along for the ride."" Now, one thing they do, if you are a stranger to the dealership, is photocopy your driver's license.On the other hand, if you go into a Ford dealership (not picking on Ford), to drive a new Taurus, they ALWAYS go on the ride with you, ditto with Honda, Mazda and VW, to name a few.Since it has never happened -- the salesrep ride along -- with this class of car, I usually take a long test drive (about 1 CD's worth) and then almost immediately go onto the next car I am considering and repeat the same test drive (over the same roads, route, etc.) also for about 1 CD (the same CD, natch.)My wife and I have a routine for testing that permits about three (maybe four) cars to be tested back to back to back (to back) in one day (Saturday or Sunday if possible.) This most recent time we used the video capture feature of an iPhone 4G and she recorded my reactions while I drove and I recorded hers, etc -- as we drove each car over the exact same route, speeds, etc, etc. Afterwards we compared our instantaneous reactions as first I drove an Audi, then a Cadillac then an Acura (ditto her.)Frankly, and I know many here will argue that I must have been on something, we drove an Audi S4 Premium Plus, a CTS-4 Sport Luxury (with 19"" sport package) and an Acura TL SH-AWD Advance back to back to back: we found the S4 and the TL to be twin sons of different mothers they were so close in their capabilities (and the TL was the clear price winner.) The CTS4 was ""very nice"" but seemed to lack the weapons grade torque the other two seemed to have (and I admit the S4 had more, but the difference was not worth the extra premium price, especially considering the fact that the S4 didn't even have nav.)Our test drives include: acceleration runs (to 80+MPH), parking lot (empty) ""slalom runs"" (to test understeer -- be aware this causes motion sickness if you have just eaten), panic braking (with ESP on and off), freeway driving (20+ miles, one way, or so, at least) and secondary road (where there is very low traffic) ""performance"" driving. We listen to the radio (AM, FM and Sat) and the CD. We test for bluetooth pairing with a Blackberry (difficult to do for many cars) and we see how intuitive the voice command/prompt systems are, etc.If you take along some popcorn, you can make a really entertaining day of it -- and come to some rather unanticipated conclusions, too. Take me, for instance -- I thought for certain I would end up with Audi #30 or an Infiniti M37X. Acura wasn't really on my radar. I thought I would end up with a Volvo S60 T6 before I would ever go for a ""butt ugly"" Acura.DOH! :surprise: "
"kdshapiro","October 2011"," The 2012 M is gorgeous. And I somewhat disagree about the salesperson going along for the ride.Honda, check. Toyota, check. Ford, no. Lexus, no. Acura, never drove it. BMW, didn't have to drive it.Im now 4 months into my g37 and that vehicle puts a smile on my face. I was going to go for the 335i but the value and sportiness and price point of the g was hard to refuse.I rented both the g and CTS for a week. The week rental of the g is what swayed my decision. The acura didn't do it for me, even though I'm a fan of Honda. Wasn't interested in Audi or Volvo. Es wasn't sporty enough. G is quick when you get on the gas and rides like its on rails. "
"flightnurse","October 2011"," A few years back my partner and I were looking to buy an SUV, we stopped in an Acrua Dealer, talked to the sales guy (no pressure at all) he got a copy of our licenses and handed us the keys a MDX, said, we close at 9pm be back before that (this was at 4pm.) When we came back we talked to the sales guy and bought the MDX (touring with Nav.) It was the best test drive I have ever taken, no pressure whats so ever. We had it for 4 years until we traded it in on a 2009 X5. Is Acura still doing these kind of test drives? "
"billyperksii","October 2011","  Some do in CT- the ones who think they can milk you for your last penny- did someone say Norwalk CT. "
"andres3","October 2011"," Hmmm, maybe that's why I've never got to do a test drive without the salesman present, whether it was me or my significant other doing the driving and whether or not we were together or I was alone.Of course, I've only purchased a Honda and an Audi A3 new myself. Maybe driving into the Audi dealer with a Honda made them treat me like a VW customer.Do they ever impose mileage restrictions on you? I'd imagine if someone said be back before closing and that gave me 5 hours driving time, you could drive 300 miles easily averaging 60 MPH. I'm thinking 150 miles would be a sufficient test drive. In San Diego, that would be like a drive to Julian and back; which would be perfect to test all of the capabilities properly.I don't necessarily need to be alone, but I think 100 or so miles are needed to make a purchase decision on something over $30K. "
"andres3","October 2011"," I'm shocked you found the TL to be every bit the car the S4 was (well, almost). Doesn't the S4 have a 25 or so HP advantage as well over the TL?I'd always imagined the TL would have a much softer Lexus like ride vs. the sport oriented S4. "
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," Check this out -- and what you will read is about the big beak 5-spd version of the TL vs the toned down, little beak, 6-spd version of the TL.In this test, the cars had manual transmissions, to be clear.http://www.automobilemag.com/reviews/driven/1008_2010_acura_tl_sh_awd_vs_2010_au- - di_s4/index.html "

"
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," All I am saying is I drove a 2011 S4 Premium Plus, followed by a 2011 Cadillac CTS/4, followed by a 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD Advance. My reactions, without price considerations:#1 S4 if it were the Prestige version#2 TL, as is#3 Cadillac -- nice to look at, but too much emphasis on lux, not enough on sportWith price factored in:#1 TL SH-AWD Advance (which includes 19"" wheels and tires)#2 S4 -- but way too much money#3 Cadillac -- nice to look at, but too much emphasis on lux, not enough on sportI ended up choosing a 2012 Audi A4 Prestige w/sport package as my #1 choice since it and the TL were comparbly equipped and priced.Then, being a leasing customer, finding a 42 month lease on the A4 to be over $100 per month higher than the 36 month TL lease, I went with the Acura.The Acura does not blow me away -- but, FOR THE MONEY, the Acura is 8.5/10ths as ""good"" as the S4. The Acura continues to impress me everytime I drive it. I doubt I will have much lust for it -- the Audi seemed like the kind of ride you might consider pawning something for, not so the Acura or Cadillac.I gave the Acura a ""+"" since it is made in North America -- been a long time since I owned (or leased) something primarily ""made in America,""I am NOT trying to convice you to choose the Acura over a BMW 3 or Audi A4 or even over a Volvo S60 T6 or Type-R. I am simply saying someone, once, did a cross comparison of an S4 and a TL and found them to be able to be talked about in the same breath, sentence and paragraph.If someone would have magically lowered the term and monthly lease payment price on the A4 2.0T Prestige, I would propbably be THERE, now.Mean time, I must say one thing for sure, the TL has the best factory sound system I have ever heard. The fact that it handles pretty well and accelerates strong is nothing but gravy. :surprise: "
"andres3","October 2011"," Mean time, I must say one thing for sure, the TL has the best factory sound system I have ever heard.I have heard and read that from many people and sources. Find a DVD-A (DVD Audio disc) and put that in to be truly blown away for sound quality.However, I'm sure your tested S4 didn't have the Bang & Olufsen optional sound system which has garnered some magnificent attention lately for Audi. "
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," I have about a half a dozen DVD Audio disks, and you are right -- wow! My outgoing 2009 A4 Prestige had the B&O system and it was great, too, but nothing like the Acura ELS system in Dolby PLII or DVD-Audio (or DTS CD's for that matter, too.)I wonder why, in this day and age of BRANDING, that Acura chose not to have a tie in with a name brand sound system? "
"kdshapiro","October 2011"," I have the upgraded bose on my G, I played ""the matrix"" and was blown away by the sound quality and separation. B&O though has a very good reputation for making top shelf products.I haven't heard the TLs sound system in person, but I've read on forums those who have and who have heard the G's system, say there are equals. "
"andres3","October 2011"," I don't know. Bose spends more on marketing than on the products.There is a saying, ""No highs, no lows, must be BOSE!""Harmon/Kardon has a better reputation in sound quality, but even they seem to skimp out for BMW installations.I think Acura did the right thing in doing it themselves with no name tied to it, but probably, they did outsource to some company out there that remained nameless, or they hunted and hired some key personnel from one of the sound/speaker companies. "
"kdshapiro","October 2011"," I guess it depends. I have a number of BOSE products and are very happy with them.We are talking about stock stereo systems. Based on the source I suspect there will be a lot of variability. The only thing is Acura can play dvd-a discs, which, imo is going the way of cassette. It is debateable if there is a real world difference between a DVD-A disc at 96khz and a DVD disc at 48khz. "
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," My wife has the BOSE upgrade in her 2011 Infinity -- it is very good. But nothing, so far, comes close (OEM) to what is in the Acura (the ELS system, is the one I am speaking of.)The B&O was also very good -- it must be the sub-woofer in the Acura, since music ""feels"" so much more alive in the Acura than either the Audi or the Infiniti.I agree DVD-Audio, good as it is, is about as popular as DIVX. I suspect that this is, once again, caused by ""good being the enemy of great!""I do find this somewhat confusing since Blu-ray seems to be a success and HDTV, too, seems to be the preferred way to watch TV these days.Some of the DVD-Audio disks are truly amazing -- and very scarce.Unfortunately, I end up listening to Sirius-XM most of the time. And, it is truly poor it is so limited in dynamic range and, frankly, fidelity. It is, however, better than most FM stations and being ""never out of signal/range"" is a big plus on those 100 mile commutes between cities I seem to make so often.I had hoped for more from Sat-Radio. But, I must admit I do like the station called Deep Tracks -- and Watercolors is pretty good too. "
"kdshapiro","October 2011"," Re Acura ELS, that's what I'm saying. I've read a lot of he/she said on how good it is based on what audio source.Have you tried playing a high qualify DVD with 5.1 in the thing? It's sounds amazing.I agree about XM, however and this is a big however, I'll forgo the dynamic range to have the choice of music. 40's on 4, 60's on 6, 70's on 7, watercolors, soul/r&b whatever. I listened to xm when i rented the G in the desert, miles from anything. Loved it. Not to mention I'm loading up the harddrive with all sorts of stuff. "
"andres3","October 2011"," I guess it depends. I have a number of BOSE products and are very happy with them.Have you owned comparable products to the BOSE from other companies at similar price points?It is not debateable whether a regular DVD is as good in sound quality as a DVD-A. It is not only the difference between 96 Khz and 48 khz for the bandwidth but also 16bit vs. 24bit/96Khz. I'll take the Pepsi challenge anyday with my home audio system and I'm positive the differences are noticeable and substantial. I even have a 24-Bit/48 Khz that sounds noticeably better than regular DVD's. However, you are right, SACD and DVD-A killed each other in a double suicide just like the fate of HDDVD.Blu-Ray has SACD/DVD-A audio potential along with HD video capability to go with it, so once cars get Blu-Ray players, DVD-Audio will be obsolete. "
"billyperksii","October 2011"," Mark, XM is so yesterday, why pay for the services after the 3 months freebie?Streaming is the way to go these days- Pandora and the list goes on.I like Pandora in particular, it does not loose is connectivity as some of the other sources. "
"andres3","October 2011"," Not to mention that XM and Sirius are guilty of downgrading and compressing the beamed out signals so much that it negates any advantage in technology! "
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," The thing is, XM is so easy to use and certain stations (mostly the ones with live announcers, it seems) aren't as badly compressed as others. I like the ability to listen to Deep Tracks for a while then switch to 60's, then classical, then Spa then Watercolors, etc.How would I get Pandora, live, in a moving car, pardon my ignorance? "
"kdshapiro","October 2011"," What is debateable and what I was getting at, is can you hear the difference at 65 mph over rough, noisy pavement? Between the two formats. I'll bet not.I'm not talking about a high-end home theater system, I'm talking about wind noise, road noise, rain noise all at once. "
"kdshapiro","October 2011"," That's okay, I understood that going in. I lowered my expectations of sound quality to be able to quickly and easily listen to the music format of my choice. "
"andres3","October 2011"," Ah.. That's fair. I would expect to get top notch bandwidth if I'm going to pay for a service like radio (be it HD or Satellite or whatever). I'm already mad at Cox Cable because I've noticed that not only does HD video just BARELY get enough bandwidth to not pixilate in my neighborhood, but the sound quality coming out of HD channels is far from HD-like. It isn't even digital cable like! And I'm paying them a fortune every month! Something's gonna give soon! "
"andres3","October 2011"," Ahhh... now that makes sense. The car isn't the best medium to listen to music, but is often the one most available time and schedule wise.That being said, higher quality source and output couldn't hurt! It can only help. A Lexus is going to be far quiter at 65 MPH than your typical vehicle over rough noisy pavement, so some cars might fare better than others. Even the type of tires you buy can make a big difference with ""driving"" noise. "
"fedlawman","October 2011"," The recording (mastering/mixing) has a much bigger effect on fidelity than the bitrate.Talking Heads ""Stop Making Sense"" is one of the best sounding discs out there, and it's ""just"" DTS. On the other hand, I have some SACD's that sound like junk even though they're 24/192. The Police ""Every Breath You Take - The Singles"" sounds terrible.Most of the time, I can barely (if at all) tell the difference between a Redbook CD and SACD even when listening carefully with headphones. In a car?!?! Forget about it. The best thing about the Acura sound system is the surround sound. That's definitely worthwhile and is what truly makes it stand apart from the others.Mark, do you have any Porcupine Tree DVD-A's? You must get some - they will blow you away! "
"billyperksii","October 2011"," Mark:I am guessing you have about twenty years on me (I am seventies baby) If you have the internet on your smartphone- all you need to do is go to the Pandora site and create an account (free with limited commercilas- upgrades are available), you create your own stations (artist, songs, era etc etc ) and just sync it to the bluetooth feature in the car- Its that simple- I find it good for long trips with the kids, they create their stations we hit the road and they enjoy the ride. "
"kdshapiro","October 2011"," I can stream pandora, nobex, iheartradio from my blackberry through my car's speakers, but why? I have much more variety on XM, it sounds better, and doesn't cost that much.If one is going to plunk down $40+ for a TL or G37 and pay expensive dealer maintenance(at least Acura, I'll find out about Infiniti, first two services are free) and put premium in the car, then what is another $150/year for an XM subscription. Makes no sense to me not to get it.But I guess to each their own. "

"billyperksii","October 2011"," I was with XM for several years then they came out with this Royalty Fees which I think was presumptuous for them to pass on to the customers-thats why I left.I find streaming to be the future of radio listening- who wants to pay to listen to the radio- I know I dont, considering the multiple FREE options available.Secondly, the streaming sound quality is above average through the Acura speakers- cannot attest to the Bose. "
"ivan_99","October 2011"," Don't you pay for bandwidth? If you're streaming for 1-2 hours a day don't you have overage charges? Doesn't XM have better coverage?I don't do either...but if you're paying for content it doesn't matter if it is called Radio, XM, streaming, or magnetic pulses...as long as the content is of high quality...and you place enough value on it to pay for it...it all equals the same to me. "
"andres3","October 2011"," The recording (mastering/mixing) has a much bigger effect on fidelity than the bitrate. I agree, the engineering of the recording and the quality of the mastering and mixing matters more than the source itself. There are bum DVD-A and SACD's just like their are incompetent regular CD's too.A well recorded and mixed DVD-A or SACD will still be noticeably better than a well recorded regular old CD. The potential is just higher, and of course allows 5.1 mixing.Fleetwood Mac's Rumours DVD-A is an example of a high quality mixing/mastering on the medium of DVD Audio. "

"graphicguy","October 2011"," fedlawman....once again, you've proven your expertise in both cars and audio.... The recording (mastering/mixing) has a much bigger effect on fidelity than the bitrate. Talking Heads ""Stop Making Sense"" is one of the best sounding discs out there, and it's ""just"" DTS. On the other hand, I have some SACD's that sound like junk even though they're 24/192. The Police ""Every Breath You Take - The Singles"" sounds terrible. Most of the time, I can barely (if at all) tell the difference between a Redbook CD and SACD even when listening carefully with headphones. In a car?!?! Forget about it. The best thing about the Acura sound system is the surround sound. That's definitely worthwhile and is what truly makes it stand apart from the others. Mark, do you have any Porcupine Tree DVD-A's? You must get some - they will blow you away!Trying to remember who told me, but from a reliable source.......the ELS sound system in the TL-Tech is made by Pioneer. Why they don't brand it, I really don't know. It might be Acura's choice. I know for awhile, Acura was using car systems by Clarion, but the current ones that come with the tech packages (not sure about the source for their standard stereos) are from Pioneer.Long and short of it, I think Acura used to use Bose, and advertised that they did (requirement from Bose, perhaps?). But, that was several years ago. Since then, they never advertise who makes their car stereos (same for Honda).It's still the best car sound system I've ever listened to. That includes the HK system in my 335i (which is no slouch) and the B&O systems I heard in the Audis I test drove.BTW...agreed on Porcupine Tree. Also see if you can find the DVD-A disk from Dishwalla called Opaline. Don't get the ""dual disk"" one, but the DVD-A version.YES-Fragile is probably the best DVD-A I've ever heard.Too bad that format never really took hold. Also too bad my HK system in the BMW doesn't play DVD-A disks, either.I find the HK system in the BMW to sound better streaming from my iPhone than it does when Sirious or HD RADIO is the source. "
"flightnurse","October 2011"," When I was competing in car audio contest, the disk's I use for sound quality was George Micheal's ""Faith"" album. For me one of the best produced albums of that decade. Next was Michael Jackson's ""BAD"" then Simple Red ""Picture Book"" then Sade ""Diamond Life"" lastly Metallica""Metallica"" its been years since I have competed but these were the disk I used. "

I figure I'll just hold onto mine as I have an OPPO multi-format blu ray player to play my modest collection.Let me know what you think of Opaline.nurse....I was never a George Michael or Metallica fan. Not sure I'll ever be one.Was in Florida for work last week. Hertz gave me a Fusion. Those are nice little drivers. I was surprised at how well it drove. Was very happy to get back into my 3 at the airport when I got home, though. "
"fedlawman","October 2011"," Yeah, I've seen the silly prices those out of print DVD-A's and SACD's fetch (or try to fetch anyway). I own a few discs that are supposedly worth a fortune (Patricia Barber - Modern Cool and Roxy Music - Avalon to name two).I've ripped all my DVD-A's for hi-rez 2-channel streaming, but for surround and SACD listening, I have kept all my discs as well (I have an Oppo too).I will let you know how I like Opaline!And to get back on topic - as great as they sound, if I had a TL, I don't think I'd risk playing any of those DVD-A's in the car unless I was just sitting in the driveway. It would be a shame to scratch something irreplaceable.EDIT: My co-worker has a Fusion Hybrid for work. I drove it for a while while my Malibu Hybrid (don't laugh, I didn't choose it...LOL!) was at the shop for a battery recall. The Fusion is quick and handles well, but I didn't like the seatbacks (they pushed on my shoulder blades and created hotspots) or the unrefined engine noise. "

It would be a shame to scratch something irreplaceable. I don't think I can trace the blame for any scratches on a disk to any of my car stereo's over the years. One of the benefits of SACD and DVD-A was supposed to be that it was either scratch resistant or almost immune to sensitivity from minor scratches. They are supposed to be quite durable. So far, I have none that cause any skipping issues, but then again, I have not seen any DVD-A or SACD systems sold for vehicles yet (other than factory Acura system).Are these disks really irreplaceable? Maybe OPPO will come out with an SACD/DVD-A burner someday. "
"sweendogy","November 2011"," Noticed the new 3 series has been posted on BMW website. It seems BMW had gone the route of sport, Lux and mix. 3 cars that have different personalities . Like the way the new sport model looks - hope they hold pricing to 2011 levels. The 4 cyl is an interesting option - I mean if they can get the performance of the current 328 - with highway Mpgs in the low to mid 30's it will be very interesting- plus it still a rwd platform so turns will continue to be fun. A hybrid will prob be in tenge near future as well. Nice to see the leader continuing to evolve - this should make Infiniti react - this could get interesting "
"carnaught","November 2011"," By ""new"", do you mean the new body style (VanHooydonk designed, rather than Bangle) ? "
"flightnurse","November 2011"," I saw that last night, the new turbo 4 is an interesting engine, in the Z4 the turbo 4 s faster then the 3 liter, so hopefully the new 3 will faster too. I like the interior of the sport model, so far one can not build the new car until it is showed at the LA auto show. "
"flightnurse","November 2011"," Yes its a whole new car... "
"kdshapiro","November 2011"," I really liked the looks of the new 3. The specs for the turbo 4 should up the ante quite nicely in the performance arena. Making about 260 hp should put the 328 in a whole new ballgame. While it may not be the speed demon of the 335, it should hold it's own against some of the other midsize sedans that offer in the mid-250s hp. "
"shipo","November 2011"," From my perspective, the horsepower race has gotten out of hand and now even the lowest power 3-Series is more than powerful enough even if other similar sized vehicles offer more power for less money.To underscore that point, my 2002 530i 5-Speed was just about as perfect a car for my needs, wants, and desires from a size, power, feature, and performance perspective as there could ever be, and the new 3-Series will (or should) have a tad more space inside, weigh about the same, have considerably more power, perform even better, get better fuel economy, and cost less. Could it be that the new 328i 6-Speed with the 2.0 liter blown mill will be even more perfecter for me than my 5er? From everything I've seen and read about the F30, it definitely looks like that may be the case. :shades: "
"billyperksii","November 2011"," That's Infiniti's mission statement-""more horsepower, courser engines and jerky rides"". "
"kdshapiro","November 2011"," The 530 manual was the epitome of what represented a BMW. However, time marches on and things change. BMW has had to change with the times.This new 328 hopefully will usher BMW into a new era for the 3 series. I really like the styling, hits the nail right on the head. "
"kdshapiro","November 2011"," I disagree with you. If you would like to explain your position instead of posting a drive-by shot at Infiniti please feel free to do so. "
"markcincinnati","November 2011"," Our first and only Infiniti, thus far, is a 2011. I cannot speak to or about what has gone before. Between my wife and I, we have had 29 Audis, 3 VW's 3 BMW's, 1 Infiniti and 1 Acura. I would say based on our ownership experiences and our many, many test drives, that your comment about Infiniti's mission statement has to be based on something you read (but not much) or some personal experience (?) you may have had sometime in the past -- or else you're just poking the fire for whatever reason.I would say, at this point in my experience, that Infiniti is the Japanese BMW (praise for the Infiniti, that is) and that Acura is the Japanese Audi (praise primarily for Acura but actually some praise back at Audi, too.)Courser engines? Well, at their RPM limits, Infiniti engines are not quite up to the BMW reputation of silky smoothness, but I would not think this is part of any kind of a mission statement. As to the comment jerky rides -- I will simply have to write that off as most likely coming from a position of ignorance or confusion. :confuse: "
"shipo","November 2011"," While I agree that the ""gotta have it"" crowd buys a car for its specifications as written, some of us still buy a car for how well it fits the mission we're buying it for. When I bought my 530i it was the first time in my life I didn't opt for the largest/most powerful engine available for the model I was buying. I considered a 540i 6-Speed, but given how powerful and balanced the 530i was, I just couldn't justify the extra $8,000 (apples to apples).Given that the F30 328i will weigh roughly 200 pounds less than my E39 530i, have (depending upon the source) anywhere from 20 to 40 more horsepower and 45 to 60 more pound-feet of torque, one might make the case that the F30 328i will be able to give an E39 540i 6-Speed a run for its money. In my mind, other than the paper specifications of the 328i and 335i versus the competition, the new baby 3er is, if anything, too powerful (not that I'm going to complain mind you). "
"rayainsw","November 2011"," 'new baby 3er is, if anything, too powerful 'Heresy, I say.- RayTQ junkie..... "
"shipo","November 2011"," Not at all a surprising comment from a Torque Junkie!  "
"fedlawman","November 2011"," Most premium car companies want to attract younger customers with their entry-level cars with the hopes that as they (the customer) get older they'll move up the line.So what is BMW doing?

"shipo","November 2011"," For my part I'm not comlaining; I'm going to be able to buy an extremely competitive replacement for my 530i, with ten year newer technology, better performance, better handling, better fuel economy, and for less money. Personally I could care less whether it says 328i or 530i on the trunk lid.  "

"fedlawman","November 2011"," Dan - Got back from a business trip today and had a package waiting for me.

A worthy addition to my collection. "
"sweendogy","November 2011"," Infinitis statement is working - they sell a boatload of cars- get good reviews - and continue to be relevant in this blog. "
"billyperksii","November 2011"," The point I was trying to make is- Infiniti is spending so much time chasing BMW that they are getting left behind in the dust. Secondly, I base my buying on my own experience with the car and the features that fits my needs. Not like the gullible ones that goes by what some magazine articles states. I say this all the time, back in 2000 when I graduated college, I got a decent job in a brokerage shop making a relatively good salary. I wanted a car and saw the Mazda Millennia, every research I did gave the car thumbs down. Me and my infinite wisdom test drove the car for about 2 hours- car was incredible and gave zero problems for the 36 months that I leased it.I have no problems with Infiniti, I wanted the FX when they first came out, I went the NYC auto show to check it out and it was a big disappointment in terms of rear space accommodations. I wanted the G35x, same problem-space and in addition that awful growl that invades the cabin.The TL has been very very good in the 27 months of ownership, the next stop for me are the Germans-if Acura upgrades the RL to a V8, I will stick with the brand. Here is the short list for next car hunt-E550 4maticE63 (Depends on the bonus and incremental base pay increase)550 XIWhat do you think SWEENYDOG????? "
"graphicguy","November 2011"," fedlawman...glad you enjoyed ""Opaline"". It's one of my faves....especially in surround.While the weather is still nice (high 60s....in November, no less), I'm going to have to do a ""get ready for winter"" detail. Of course, now that the time change occurred, I'm hoping the weather holds out for the weekend, since it's too dark to do after work.After 4K miles, I'm averaging 23.4 MPG in my 335i xDrive. Pretty darn good. I'm pleased. "
"markcincinnati","November 2011"," I too have my copy of Opaline DVD-A. I like it A LOT. It reminds me of a mash-up of sounds from a couple of other groups, dominated by a kind of Hootie and the Blowfish sound but with a touch more of an acoustic mood.Hard to beat for the price and in the TL it is a tasty treat of tunage!Try some of the DTS offerings, if you get a chance -- also quite a treat, usually. "
"kdshapiro","November 2011"," Having just bought a G37, I spent a week with it on a trip. I'm not impressed with Acura TL, they have not really moved forward in few years. And while I did a boat load of driving and looking, my wife and I were on the same page regarding the Acura, just no interest.The cabin was too big for me along with the turning radius.The G37 is a very compelling package. A fully loaded car, except the tech package cost me what a basic 335 would have been. (The 2012 M is really sweet and the M hybrid is gorgeous.) Does BMW fulfill it's mission better, yep. Would I rather be driving a 550 yep or even a 335, yep. But there are always compromises in life. "
"fedlawman","November 2011"," I like the quieter tracks best. I love ""Today/Tonight,"" ""Candleburn,"" and ""Drawn Out."" Great songs with simply stunning sound! A couple of the louder tracks sound a little compressed/congested in places when I play them at volume.Mark - I hear some U2 and Coldplay in this album.The weather already sucks here and my M is in semi-hibernation now (battery tender all week long). That's surprisingly good fuel economy - neither of my cars (Volvo and BMW - both with significantly smaller & less powerful engines) do as well. "
"graphicguy","November 2011"," fed....mark.....glad you like my recommendations. ""Today/Tonight"" is one of my favorite tracks, too. About 3 years ago, DTS was selling their own surround music disks on their own WEB site. I suspect they were getting out of the surround music biz in favor of the more popular (and more volume) DTS HD movie blu ray disks. Some interesting titles. Haven't listened to them in a while. Don't know if they're out of print or not. Have to dig them out.My MPG is at 50-50 city/interstate. When I'm all interstate, it bumps up to about 28 MPG. All city driving is about 20-21 MPG. Pleased with all of it. Turbo 6 cyl, gobs of torque, no turbo lag, I'm liking it.I still have to wonder how the BMW faithful will react to 4 cyl motors in the 2012 vs what has been years and years of 6 cyl offerings. I've read and heard of how ""wonderful"" the new 4 cyl engines are supposed to be. However, I don't know of anyone who's driven one yet (including the trade rags). "
"fedlawman","November 2011"," I have to admit that the I-6 is intoxicating. I love the turbine-smooth power and sound it makes. It's one of the things I miss the most about my old 325i. I'm sure the new 4 will be smooth, but I doubt if it will match the refinement of the I-6. On the other hand, it will no doubt be much smoother and more refined than the I-4 and I-5 I currently own.I'm going to have to research those DTS discs... "
"billyperksii","November 2011"," To each his own- I say the opposite, TL over the G.Secondly, what do you mean Acura has not moved forward in a few years. Tell me what's so advanced on the G that the TL does not have mechanically and technologically? I am really baffled on this satement. "
"tlong","November 2011"," I took the survey:- You should make it clear the purpose of the survey in your post- There's an issue where you rank features 1-5 in importance, but there are only two features to rank.  "
"markcincinnati","November 2011"," Alan Parsons and Steely Dan in/on DTS -- great discs.However, I've noticed that some of the ""remastered"" discs that are just normal CD's sound great on the TL's PLII mode -- it almost makes me understand why DTS, DVD-A and SACD never really caught on: Good Very good is the enemy of great, once again. :surprise: "
"markcincinnati","November 2011"," I wanted (and still do) an Infiniti product. I love my wife's '11 FX35 Premium (in black with the Java interior) -- but, I didn't want to have 2 of the same thing and I absolutely had to have blind spot indication (coming from my '09 Audi A4 Prestige where it was standard equipment.) The only Infiniti that I could get that had BSI was the M and I had to order an M with BOTH Premium and Technology packages to get the BSI (and the tech package seemed to contain expensive automatic cruise control hardware and software that I did not see -- at this time anyway -- the value in.) I also shopped for a new A6, but the lease rates and the discounts offered were breathtaking (and not in a good way)!So, I test drove the G37X with EVERYTHING on it and found it to be great fun to drive and with acceptable levels of sport and lux -- and the lease prices were fantastic. Yet, the G could not be had with BSI -- and it seems (and is) a narrow vehicle, both in the interior width and the track. The G has a track of 60.2"" and the TL is 63.8"" -- you can feel the difference; and to me the difference made the TL feel more stable and nimble (almost like my outgoing 2009 A4.)I probably would have gone with the G, despite the above, had it offered BSI.Another contender was the Volvo T6 which could be had with BSI and felt even quicker with its ""right now"" torque, thanks to the turbo.As someone said, to each his/her own -- the G just seemed cramped inside and somehow, compared to what I was used to, made me feel like I was a bug when I took it out on the Interstate (full of semi's).Drive it like you live. :shades: "
"billyperksii","November 2011"," I am with you- it was on my short list.I think I am in pretty good shape 6' 1"" +/- 218 lbs, I body build 4 times per week for 45 mins. The car just felt like my 99 Mazda Millennia in terms of space. "

"markcincinnati","November 2011"," What once were vices are now virtues. . . .I never had TPMS until 2005 -- now, it too, is a must have (and it is now mandatory, so no longer a possible disqualifier.)Got electronic stability control (branded ESP) in 2001, after thinking ""why would I need that, I've got ABS?"" -- then, after having it just one year, it became a must have, too (I understand it too will be no longer an option, this MY.)Thought a back-up camera AND parktronic (aka backup sensors) were redundant -- now, after seeing the around view monitor PLUS front and rear parktronic (on my wife's Infiniti), I can hardly imagine not having AT LEAST a back-up camera and parktronic. Actually, I wish I had front and rear parktronic like my wife's 2005 and 2008 BMWs had on them.Torque vectoring? Yep, it is rapidly overtaking both plain ol' Quattro and ATTESA as THE drive-line must have.6,7,8 and more speed transmissions -- you guessed it: Must have.Tires that auto-correct for under (or over) inflation: #1 Coming soon; #2 Must have (think of the billions of dollars of fuel alone this tech will save.)Auto shut off and restart after full stop: ditto.Heated AND Cooled (ventilated) seats: need you even ask?In-car communications systems that when activated automatically turn down ventilation fans to assure the voice command systems ""hear"" the commands you give with nearly zero errors?

"markcincinnati","November 2011"," Didn't forget them at all . . . just thought my [subjective] point had been made. Hell, I grew up where only rich people's cars had A/C and power windows. My dad got a new Plymouth in 1969 with power steering -- but no power brakes. And even though it was the top of the line Plymouth Satellite with a 318 V8 (the 383 and Hemi were reserved for the Road Runner and the 440 was for the GTX), it didn't have factory air -- so my dad had the dealer install aftermarket A/C which meant the front bench seat could only seat two instead of three because of the ""device"" (the blowing unit) that was installed that stuck way out into the passenger area.The first time I got a car with power steering, brakes AND windows, I knew I had become a member of ""the club."" That car was a 1976 Chrysler Cordoba with fine Corithian Leather (how many remember that reference?)It still had an AM only radio though, but with a speaker in the rear deck it was ""upscale"" befitting someone of my stature (in ""the club,"" of course.)And, man o' man, when I got a car that had a rear window defroster (which was a slit in the rear deck through which air was blown by a motor located in the trunk), well, peel me a grape, Mabel. Power door locks engendered a similar reaction when I got a 4-door car with FRONT only power door locks (and, as I recall, FRONT only power windows, too.) The dome light only came on when you opened a FRONT door, on this car -- probably saved $.50 per door to omit the rear on/off switch.When I got an Audi with an infra-red remote (who's dumbass idea was THAT, anyway? -- infra-red, geesh) -- I had another grape peeling moment as well.These days its power everything on virtually every car -- and even if you didn't want these assists, well, it would be virtually impossible to NOT have them.My 1978 Audi 5000 was my first car with heated seats -- I used to take people for rides in the car and secretly turn on the seat heaters. . .why? Because back then heated seats were rare (and novel.)I also didn't forget articulating headlights, nor did I forget bi-xenons (which the Acura TL lacks, strangely.)Memories. . .memories. . . . :blush: "
"markcincinnati","November 2011","  You may be right about your longevity concern -- I really don't know. What I have read, however, is that the full stop, engine shut off, then engine restart when ""the light changes"" will save countless gallons of fuel once this tech is widespread.Perhaps there is little to be concerned with about the engine -- I would, however, wonder if the constant restarting of the engine would not be hard on the starter MOTOR?In any case, I assume this auto shut off will be placed in widespread use as we strive to save every drop of fuel we can by almost any and every means even remotely possible.Somewhere I read that there is a patent on a technology that ""warms up"" the transmission when the car is started COLD; this warm transmission apparently yields a bit more MPG's, and, over the life of the car, this ""bit more"" adds up. It is especially interesting when one extrapolates this to millions of cars and finds that the annual savings ends up being a governmental sum of money and fuel saved (so they say.)Fuel saving tires have been in production and use for years (you can tell I watch too much TV) -- even though the savings per car are only a few drops of fuel annually (but again when extrapolated to millions of cars, these drops become a big deal and big bucks.)Mostly (which is NOT the same as entirely) I am for virtually all new technolgies and also for the upgrading of ""older"" technologies to make them ""better"" (and greener, too, if possible). When a new technology is found to be wasteful, harmful or just plain inappropriate though, I am all for scrapping it, beginning a new project or exploring a new idea and moving forward. :surprise: "
"kdshapiro","November 2011"," I remember when my father had an Audi 5000 and Audi 4000 side by side in the garage. After the 4000 he got a Legend. Yep, memories. "
"shipo","November 2011"," Regarding the whole Start/Stop thing while sitting stopped at a light or some such, I don't think it will affect engine longevity at all. Why? Because the bulk of engine wear comes when cold starting an engine where the lubricant has had a considerable amount of time to drain down into the sump; a couple of minutes at a light just isn't all that long in the grand scheme of things.Other fuel economy related thoughts:I find the concentration on things like transmission oil temperatures for improving fuel economy curious, and if I might be so bold, highly questionable. From my perspective, for a relatively modest investment (compared to the potential gain), it makes sense to me to harvest the latent heat radiating off the exhaust system to power the various subsystems of the vehicle. I'm thinking there is many-many times the necessary power lost in the form of radiated heat to drive the electricals, the power assist pumps, the A/C compressor, and even the valve train (electrically or hydraulically).Remove the mechanical load of all of those components from the engine and fuel economy should easily see a double-digit percentage gain. The only company which has announced such a research project is BMW; hopefully it will become a reality sooner than later. "
"graphicguy","November 2011"," I know there was quite a stir when the Hyundai Genesis came out. Don't know if it fits in this discussion, but I actually had test driven one when they first came out. Nice ""first"" effort at a lux car by Hyundai (they really should change their name for cars sold in the U.S.).Well, I got my first chance to drive one for an extensive period of time. It was a rental (Enterprise). It was the 6 cyl model with what looked like the middle of the options package (everything but Nav).First, it's a BIG car.It drove fine....actually, it drove pretty good. I was in Milwaukee (OshKosh) WI with it when it snowed for the first time this Fall. It handled the snow and slush just fine. The suspension that everyone bitched about isn't bad...at least not as bad as I had read about here at Edmunds. Yes, there are some road surfaces that cause an unrefined chassis feeling, but for the most part, it was fine....similar to a Mercedes E, without the unrefined part. There were some things where hitting their price point caused some short cuts. If that's real wood in the cabin, the trees they used must have been very sick. The seats are....well....they're wide....certainly not very comfortable (and on the opposite end of the seats you'd find in the TL SH AWD or my 335i....both are great). The lighting is superb in the cabin.They spend the money on the drivetrain, you can tell. The engine is responsive and sounds uber refined. The transmission shifts seamlessly and is ready to kick down when needed.All the switches feel richer than they should, and operate with a smoothness that was unexpected.All-in-all a nice first effort. Came close to mimicking the A6, Mercedes E, Lexus LS, (not really in the same category as a BMW 5 from both a dynamic and performance category). Not quite hit the nail on the head, but relatively close for a lot less money. "
"sweendogy","November 2011"," Infiniti is getting left behind? Your comments again have no basis- look at the reviews and sales numbers- hello. What do I think? Well I think you are not a good car picker and if you worked at a brokerage like you say I would not let you pick a stock either. You bot a Mazda milleneum, nuf said. Good luck with the next car, made you should wait I hear Cadillac bringing back the cimarron. "
"billyperksii","November 2011"," Here we go again- reviews, sales numbers, is there anything else you base your decisions on? Of course they are getting left behind- always playin catch up to BMW.I pick based on value not like the masses (including yourself) who chases the trend. And by the way, whats wrong with the Millennia? Back in 2000 that car had all the goodies any other entry luxury car had to offer, leather, 17"" wheels, in dash 6 disc palyer, heated seats, fog lamps etc etc- it just did not have the luxury name that you tend to chase after. "
"flightnurse","November 2011"," First off attacking what a person drives is the first sign of a weak debater. The Mileneum at the time was a great car, it was to have been part of the Upper Division that mazda was going introduce (Think Acrua, Infiniti and Lexus) however Mazda has $$ problems so the 929 and Mileneum never got the support from Mazda. Which is too bad since the triple rotor Cosmos would have came here to the states.The G25 is a great car however it needs more HP, since the entry level 3 series makes more HP then G25. The G37 is no costing very close to that of the 335i when it comes to a few thousand dollars which adds only $10-30/m to payments why get the G37? The engine in the G37 isn't as smooth as the G35 was, or as smooth as the BMW. With the sport package the 3 series is a better handler.BUT it all depends on what the buyer wants, Would I like a 400hp 3 series, YES, but I'm not willing to pay entry fee into the world of the M3. Cars are so subjective that its impossible to say what is better and what is worse. "
"kdshapiro","November 2011"," I don't base my purchase decisions on reviews or sales number, but I use them to inject a sense of reality into some of these conversations. Of course, Infiniti, Acura, Cadillac is playing catch-up to BMW in one sense.On the other hand each of them has their own strong characteristics that would make them a compelling purchase for some lucky buyer.

I mean for you to have an option is fine but it's your opinion not the majority - you drove the last sudo lux car built by Mazda -that no longer exists . Infiniti has a car that saved the brand - even with its "" harsh engine."" For 40k it's a great car loaded. Look at flight nurse she couldn't swing the extra 10-30 bux a month and is stuck in the 328 when she wanted the 335 she keeps writting about. Btw I love when people talk about monthly payment verse actual cost - for me 10k is a significant number if your buying a car. If I was in that situation I would have test drove a g37xs just to actually see how it road. "

"markcincinnati","November 2011"," You may be correct that the Mazda was a great car. I think the point that was being made was that it was not a commercial success.My Mazda ""great car"" was an Audi allroad (2003) -- station wagons are apparently ""hip and cool"" (who uses that anymore?), CUV's have replaced SUV's somewhat because they are more car-like. The allroad was part station wagon (the cool part?), great CAR-LIKE attributes and it could go light off-roading.It failed (in the US at least).It is often a matter of showing the mfgr the money.This is my concern about Acura. It seems they have sliding sales and somewhat lackluster products. Their next gen refresh is critical. Show them the money!Drive it like you live. :surprise: "

Why do I need 4WD car in Phoenix, AZ? Granted it snowed here in Phoenix 3 years ago, but it melted when it hit the ground. I drove the G37S, and the engine isn't as smooth as the in-line 6 of the BMW, the transmission isn't as good as the one in the BMW, the BMW I bought handles better then the G37S, also Infiniti wasn't willing to deal on the car.

The 3 year residuals are 49 and 48% with the BMW a touch better- wonder if this will change with the new BMW 3 out soon. My point in all of this is you have to put price in the conversation when talking about these cars- a car with a higher price should be better, right? And for billy ... What logic and or common sense don't you get? I have stated sales numbers and published articles from professional car drivers. you should know this given your Investment banking background...homework before you buy something - that being said it does come down to taste when buying a car.

This is why BMW has been picked over the G series car over and over. The BMW pedals are set up for heal and toe, the transmission is smoother, the engine is smooth, the brakes work better. I haven't taken my 3 series on the track, this will change in 2 weeks, I'll be able to tell you more than. Regarding the new turbo 4 in the 3 series, I was able to drive a new Z4 with the engine in it, have to say, the power build up is better then the I6, its harsher then the I6 but the Z4 is faster with the I4. So I suspect the new 3 series will be faster too.With a few bolt on's the new turbo 4 should be able to make 300HP with out breaking a sweat.

"Kirstie_H","November 2011"," Honestly, if someone is cross-shopping the two, intending to lease, there's not enough difference in price for PRICE to be the deciding factor. Plenty of people do like the BMW included maintenance. I think a few oil changes and tire rotations is a bit of an underestimate - it'll probably chew through brake pads (and rotors) as well. "
"flightnurse","November 2011"," If anyone put's down that kind of money for lease then they do not deserve to lease a car. Those leader ad's are just that, leader ad's.

But what you said....ridiculous. "
"flightnurse","November 2011"," I disagree, there are two types of people who buy luxury cars, one who can afford it and the other are ones who think they can afford it. If people put down $4K on a lease to buy down the payment, these are the people who can not afford it. Then they shouldn't lease one. It's pretty simple... this is how America got into problem it is in.... "
"nyccarguy","November 2011"," So many people DO NOT understand leasing. It is just an alternate method of financing (thank you kyfdx), not a cheap way of getting into a more expensive vehicle. "
"wireless","November 2011"," I think mostly it is a way for people to get into an expensive car they couldn't otherwise afford. But also it's a way to get a new car more often. Either way, I think it's mostly become popular due to the car companies pushing it. They can put a car out there for two years or so and take it back and resell and make a good profit; much more so than they can on new cars. Used it where the money is now for car salesman. "
"flightnurse","November 2011"," Interesting, if people lease car's the correct way, with no money out of pocket the price difference is more then $20-30/m.

"sweendogy","November 2011"," Leader ads? The information I posted is from each manufactures ""special offers"" web page. Im a little lost with your comments. Deserve to lease a car? theBorrow Rates are very low and used car prices (rresidual Val) made leasing avail for the masses. Imagine if you had to go to the dealership with a check for the car in full - your BMW 328 would be as common as a Mazda mulenium. "
"dino001","November 2011"," You didn't undestand the actual comments:1. Putting money down on lease is defeating main lease advantage (which is transfering depreciation risk to the finance company). If car gets totalled, the downpayment is gone, gone, gone, whereas if you put nothing down, GAP (included in lease) will pick it up. Other advantages are businesses don't need to commit capital and get better tax treatment (not really applicable for consumer). That's why banks loooove people putting money down on lease and manufacturers advertise leases structured that way - they just picked up the tab and shows lower monthly payment on ads. Doesn't mean that one has to go for it - quite to contrary, it's generally bad idea, period.2. People who put money down to lower payments on lease by definition demostrate that they do not undestand lease, which means they should not lease. Lease is much more complex financing instrument with more variables that can be manipulated to create illusion of lower price. There are cases when lease may be cheaper than financing - but not because of lower payment, but because of hidden price break that is included in residual inflated above real predicted actual market value (after return, the manufacturer's bank has to eat the price difference). One who decides to lease has to understand every single aspect of it, otherwise they may be for very rude awakening at the end of the term, when they owe 3 grand outright for mileage overrage and another two for scratches. All of that has to be factored in. That's why you read those comments from people saying that if one buys based on payment, most likely they can't afford the car (""don't deserve""). It really is a simple rule of thumb - if you can't afford to buy it (loan/cash), you can't afford to lease it, either. There are some exceptions for very low mileage users, or subsidized leases, but just because monthly payment is lower, it doens't mean it's cheaper.I went through it with my recent purchase. I got 328 wagon with a few options ($45K MSRP). Correctly structured lease (0 down, 15K/yr) was about $200 per month less than 60 month loan with small ($2500) downpayment (yes - loan downpayments are making perfect sense, as they lower overall financed amount and risk of being upside down in case of a total). To me $200 per month is absolutely not enough, especially that effective finance rate was higher on the lease than on the loan. I made some quick math and it was evident that low interest loan was a better deal. Higher monthly payments, but better deal overall. Now, if somebody lives in monthly payment world, they may not really understand the concept, but that's a different discussion.  "
"flightnurse","November 2011"," Go to the Infiniti dealer and ask to see the car that is advertise for that lease price. Changes are there isn't one around.. Leader Ad... We can agree to disagree, you can put down $4K on a lease and waste your money to drive a car that you can't really afford. I'll use BMW's money and put nothing down on a lease and use my $4K for my trip to Germany when we do the European Delivery of our 2012 535i "
"flightnurse","November 2011"," Thank you setting the record straight, there is also another factor that goes into leasing, is someone credit score, if you have less then 720 mid score forget about getting the best rate on a lease these days, it wont happen. Just like what you wrote, those leader ad's will be for 10K miles a year on a 3 yr lease, how many people can drive that? "
"smarty666","November 2011"," Leasing really was a great alternative 5-6 years ago and I used to do it, but since then, the car companies have gotten greedy and over value the residuals and make it impossible to get out of the leasing cycle once you start in it. For instance, 5-6 years ago, my leases used to have great residuals and buyouts so that if you really feel in love with the car and wanted to buy it, you could without it breaking the bank. Some companies would even work with you to lower the buyout. That is no more. Now, the car companies inflate the residuals making the buyouts thousands of dollars over msrp and put disposition fees, etc because they want you to return the car at the end of the lease and get something else from them, thus never ending the cycle. I found this out the hard way and one of my vehicles is still on lease. It is going to be my last lease as I'm switching back to financing. "
"smarty666","November 2011"," You hit the nail on the head. I just sit and laugh when I see the leasing commercials from the car manufactures say things like $3995 or $4295 due at signing. That is just crazy! "
"dl_amg","November 2011"," With current economy, you can always nego to do no money down.I just sign a lease with MBUSA on 2012 C250 Sport Sedan with MSRP$43.9k on 24mo/12k mi/yr. I walked out $1k drive off incl. 1st Mo.+ Registration + 2yr srvc plan and $400 per mo. incl. tax (8.75%). Of course every deal is different but dealer is making a lot of money on these FEES! "
"m6user","November 2011"," We can agree to disagree, you can put down $4K on a lease and waste your money to drive a car that you can't really affordWhat's up with you assuming to know what people can afford or not afford?The act of putting money down on a lease has absolutely no indication as to whether the person can afford it or not. It may indicate that they either don't understand the advantages of not putting money down or they just want a little smaller monthly payment. I don't think anyone should assume that just because they may prefer a smaller payment that they ""cant afford it"". It's kind of like the old saying that people that can't afford to buy the car will lease it. Kind of like how you took affront when, because of your screenname, people assumed you were female. They could very well be much better off than you, the one accusing them of not being able to afford one of these cars. Making blanket statements like that is silly and very condescending!Complete understanding of the leasing process and concern about all the possible risks involved indicates one is more knowlegeable.....not better off. "
"sweendogy","November 2011"," Again its a deal on the website from both BMW and Infiniti. I never mentioned anything about downpayment or anything about lease specifics - so i don't know what we disagree about. The only thing I stated was that Infiniti has better posted lease prices then the BMW- pointing to company listed current leases- not blanket statement - "
"dino001","November 2011"," I looked back at your post. At fist glance G37 looks better than 328 even after rolling the downpayments into actual paments. I looked at the websites and it appears that both have 10K/yr (so you can enjoy your car mostly in your garage, not on the road). However, Infiniti expects dealers to give up over 2 grand of markup - $41K MSRP less $2.7K due is $38.3K, yet net cap cost (including $700 acq. fee) is is $36.4K, so about 2.5 grand comes out of the dealer. BMW deal is structured around MSRP, which means there is additional dealer markup that can be negotiated from. If you take out that 2 grand Infiniti dealer contribution, prices become similar. In other words you walk into BMW and you can get your price down by a bit, but at Infiniti it's probably close to bottom line.Add paid maintenance (dealer oil changes are over hundred bucks each, add set of brake pads, wipers perhaps some other things). I think it's a tie with 328 having slightly lower cost, but G37 being faster and perhaps better equipped). "
"sweendogy","November 2011"," I may not be the norm but in the first 3 years of ownership I went for oil changes, wipers and tire rotations. Oil changes can be had for 40 bux (sometimes less) at the dealer, rotations another 40 bux - and wipers are 20 bux a year.... Now mind you I own the car (not lease), only one driver and I do not hammer it to redline at stop lights. I'm sure many people have had tl go thru brakes during the same timeline but I think if you own a car and the maintience is not included you would baby it a little bit more knowing that Infiniti would not fix it on the arm. For larger ticket items the BMW program sounds great- but it does not cover those pricy run flats that are standard- hit a couple of north eastern potholes and the slight cost advantage goes away. (let's not forget the lease return fee as well) "
"dino001","November 2011"," Fat chance on those $40. There is no doubt BMW can get expensive at times. I don't kow prices at Infininti dealers, but all other lux cars (incl. Lexus or Benz) oil changes are easy north of $100 (it's both the special grade synthetic oil and labor), so I find it unlikely Infiniti would charge much less. $40 are those mineral oil changes at Chevy, Ford or Toyota, not synthetic. A six pack of synthetic Mobil 1 is almost $40 at Costco and it may not be appropriate for your particular car. To balance, BMW has oil changes every 10-15K miles, depending on actual driving, which can balance several $40 per 3K miles changes.BTW, Infiniti has lease return fees. Directly from Infiniti website ""Disposition Fee due at termination of lease"". All lease companies do, no exceptions. They may sometimes waive them if you get another car of same brand. I get it- you like Infiniti. Fine, there is a lot to like. Just don't oversell it. It is not really as inexpensive as you would like to make us believe. Still 40 grand. "
"sweendogy","November 2011"," Dino - I'm not selling anything I started this trying to clairify costs- that were posted by another who said BMW was had a clear advantage in leasing. clearly you don't totally get it. Do I think the g37 is a better car for my 40k vs a 328 sure- is it better them the 335 - nope but power and price are something I value for sure. Maintenance for a car is great but let's not get blinded by the fact that BMW does this for a reason- they want you to lease and this service helps them resell the car when it comes bac for a premium as certified- its a fantastic model of how to sell cars- and caddy has followed this lead. Oil changes - well click link, 40 bux - no that fat. Now you know. http://herbchambersinfinitiofwestborough.com/Service_and_Parts_Specials "
"dino001","November 2011"," I clicked and I was right. This is mineral oil change (""synthetic extra""), which means you have three-four of those per one on BMW. So it is $100-$120 for same period of comparison. This also means two-three more visits at the place, two-three more opportunities to sell you more than just oil change.Again, G37 is a good car All I'm saying it is probably not as cheap as you want to believe. And I know you are not selling - well perhaps just your beliefs  . All I'm doing is to clarify your clarifications, trying to level the comparisons to same benchmarks. Manufacturers are great when it comes to muddy the comparisons to their advantage. Doesnt mean we have to believe everything they say. Again:1. Infiniti offer is good, but it already requires dealer's ""participation"" in discount about $2500. Lower BMW price by that amount and then recalculate lease to get the offer comparison leveled.2. Both have disposal fee.3. BMW pays all but tires and wheel alignment (which is strange) maintenance. Infiniti does not. Just periodic inspections (based on your link) will sum up to a few hundreds over the lease period. Add oil changes and some rubber and other fluids and you may go over 1000 bucks easy.4. Infiniti has better features and power. BMW has better resale. If you want comparable BMW, 335 would cost you more, no doubt.Altogether BMW may come a bit cheaper (total cost), but probably not by much. In my town BMW dealers are far superior to Infiniti in customer service and sale experience. "
"smarty666","November 2011"," Yeah, I'm going to have to call B.S. on those Infiniti service pricing as I never was quoted any where near that from my local Infiniti dealers for oil and filer and tire rotations. Those two always ended up over $100 bucks, hence why I went somewhere else to have that done. "
"sweendogy","November 2011"," You can call it what you want but again a smart shopper knowing dealers have websites and competitors will shop around and get better. Look at the link I posted. Dino, Sure it's not synthetic but the 10-15k time period between changes seems a pretty long time between dealer visits for a 40k car- I guess if its a lease who cares right ? Smarty you had an Infiniti? Weren't you the same guy talking up the TL as well?I think the with the 10 plus thou I saved not getting the 335 I can afford 3 dealer trips a year for oil. "
"dino001","November 2011"," With BMW the car tells you when to go and change the oil. Has nothing to do with the lease. 10-15K is quite normal for regular use. BTW, it is very common in Europe - there nobody uses mineral oil, even on low-end subcompacts, but they do have much longer service periods.

"flightnurse","November 2011"," Dino its not worth it, Sweeny is right we are all wrong, go back and read other postings of his and you will see a trend.If Infiniti was the better car, then BMW wouldn't be in business. However when it comes to leasing, no one wins but the banks.Just a FYI, BMW and Infiniti, Audi, Lexus, MB all drop the return fee if you lease another one of their cars, but BMW is the only one who will do it without asking. My First BMW I leased was a 325is and when I bought my 330i the fee was dropped and I never said a word. "
"carnaught","November 2011"," My son recently returned his 2008 G35 after a 3 yr. lease. Although he did not lease or buy another Infinti, there was still no disposal/return fee. Review of his lease agreement confirms no disposal fee. Has this then changed with newer Infiniti leases? "
"m6user","November 2011"," Please follow link for Infiniti oil change price of $25.95.http://www.infinitilakecounty.com/specials/service.htmI've owned an Infiniti for almost ten years and I don't believe I have ever paid over $35.99 for an oil change and of course that is not synthentic but it seems to work just fine for all this time. As I scan through my maint folder on the vehicle it seems it ran between $25 and $36 all these years. Can't account for the Infiniti dealer you frequented but I'm sure some are better than others. How many links are you going to need before you basically stop calling people liars? What does one have to do....scan and post invoices?Um, oil changes at 3k? Who does that anymore. Most newer cars have a 7500 mile change schedule. If people are going to continually exaggerate to make a point what's the sense in trying to have a discussion. Service prices have nothing to do with whether one car is better than another and I don't think that was the jist of this conversation anyway. Someone was just trying to point out the lease cost differences.....not whether one car is better or not. "
"Kirstie_H","November 2011"," Pretty close to what I was paying for my G35 oil changes as well. I sure don't recall ever thinking, ""man, these oil changes are killing me!"" My VW Jetta oil changes were more expensive due to the filter. We have one vehicle that requires $90 oil changes, but it wasn't the Infiniti.I will say that some of the maintenance items were pretty high, but I suspect they're in line with other vehicles in this class. Then again, I put 108,000 miles on it without a single repair (just maintenance), so overall it was a darn economical vehicle. "

The handling on the SH-AWD was quite impressive. The FWD had more torque steer than my 2005 TL which is not surprising given that it has more horsepower and torque than the '05 had. my question is could someone who owns a 2012 SH-AWD TL please tell me what mileage they are getting according to their trip computer. The EPA raised the MPG numbers on the 2012s, presumably due to the six speed tranny.any information would be appreciated, as i am a bit concerned about fuel economy. i have not owned an AWD car before.

Mileage ranges from 20.+ around town to 25.6+ on trips between Cincinnati and Columbus (about 100 miles each way.) Car requires premium, but I haven't had a car in years that didn't, so that is no biggie.I am at 30% of oil life left and am going to switch to Mobil1 5W-20 at the first oil change; I would expect a very slight bump in mileage due to that and due to the car reaching approximately 7,500-8,000 miles at the first change.Coming from a 2009 Audi A4 2.0T quattro (6 speed tiptronic) -- I am impressed as my mileage is slightly better on the Acura and the Acura has 305 HP compared to the Audi's 211 -- the torque (max) is better on the Acura too, but, in fairness to the Audi, since it was a turbo, the torque was available at sub 2000 rpms -- the Acura has to spin a lot faster to reach its full torque.So, net net: the Acura, IMHO, is not exactly a sipper of fuel, but it is damn close considering the power and the AWD system.No complaints from me!Drive it like you live. :shades: "

"rayainsw","November 2011"," I just had an opportunity to drive my BMW 335iS on an extended road trip. Approx. 700 miles over 2 driving days. Since I was curious, I filled the tank twice during the trip, both times at approx. half tank remaining. At the 2 fills, the car displayed 28.3 and 28.0. Excel calculates 26.9 and 27.2. Much of the driving was Interstates [ typically posted 70 MPH and maintaining 75-ish ] or divided rural routes [ typically posted 55 and running 65-ish ] &#150; with some &#145;in town&#146; driving as well.Currently at just over 2,000 miles.Car: 335iS &#150; trans. = seven speed DCT.EPA rating is 17 \ 24.Not bad, methinks, not bad at all.- RayUnable to calculate the MPG for the 1,000+ miles in Europe, because I did not realize until I returned that 2 receipts did not include the number of liters purchased . . . "
"drive4show","November 2011"," Markcincinnatithanks for the info. i appreciate it. i agree that the MPG is good for a car with that amount of power in an AWD version. I imagine the car's FWD bias is partly responsible for that, as is the V-Tec technology. I don't mind the FWD bias as long as the car moves power toward the rear in more spirited driving. The test drive I took proved it does just that. The sales rep knew that I didn't like the amount of torque steer in the FWD model I had previously driven, so he suggested an open route with a lot of curves and he had me push the car to limits beyond what I would normally do with a stranger in the passenger seat. The car was rock solid throughout. i was really sold on the handling. I have not had a BMW or an Audi, so I don't have a true benchmark comparison, but I can safely say the car handles much better than any of the cars I have owned in the past. "
"markcincinnati","November 2011"," I have (correction, my wife and I have had) twenty-nine Audi's, three BMW's and two VW's since the mid 1970's. We currently have a 2011 Infiniti FX35 AWD Premium and a 2012 Acura SH-AWD Advance.The Acura, upon first test drive (in a day with several test drives over identical routes and speeds, etc) was ""close to"" a 2011 Audi S4 Premium+ without any additional options (that is, it did not have the torque vectoring option called Sport Differential.)Many -- myself included -- scoff or repress a scoff (that's me) -- whenever I utter or type those words. But damnit Jim, I'm a doctor, not a plumber, no wait, I'm a software guy not a professional car reviewer.But there it is -- a $47,000+ Acura TL drives and feels pretty much like a potentially $59,000 Audi S4 (if they are equipped similarly the Audi's price shoots up, big time.) A serious Automobile magazine comparison of the two cars may not convice you that the Acura should be shopped against the Audi, but the numbers (produced and recorded for both cars) are not that far apart -- and it feels as if the Acura and the Audi are twin-sons of different mothers or something akin to that.look here:http://www.automobilemag.com/reviews/driven/1008_2010_acura_tl_sh_awd_vs_2010_au- di_s4/viewall.htmlIn any case, I was driving a 2009 Audi A4 2.0T Prestige w/sport package and 19"" wheels and tires with Audi Drive Select for Pete's sake -- and I wanted a new 2012 Audi. A reasonably well equipped A4 (not S4) could be had for about $47,000, so the Acura, at the price, seemed a good place to compare.Problem was, the Audi came back at a 42 month lease point that was much higher than the Acura's lease point for 36 months.Bzzz. A 4-cyc Audi w/211 HP (and it seemed smaller than the Acura) vs an Acura w/305 HP with every possible do dad that Acura throws on these cars?Even the loyalty and ""pull"" of 29 previous Audis could not make me cough up the extra money (which would have been about $200 per month).In any case, given an identical deal, I probably would have re-upped for the Audi (at the time, in fact, I am certain I would have); but the dollar done me in. Hell, at the time, for the exact same money, I probably would have gone for a Volvo S60 T6 AWD with a few option boxes ticked off.Now, 5,000 miles later -- I am, I admit it -- very pleased with my decision and love to press down on the accelerator and be rewarded with great power and power delivered as if it were coming from an ultra smooooooth turbine.The Acura TL SH-AWD Advance may not quite know what it wants to be, but for the time being it is the bargain of the bunch for performance and content methinks.Still loving the Germans, but temporarily on vacation with the Japanese.-- MarkOh yea, drive it like you live. :shades: "
"sweendogy","November 2011"," Glad you like the TL - seems like a nice rig and for the dollar is abetter buy then a loaded a4 but here is another review that's not as glowing. http://m.automobilemag.com/reviews/editors_notebook/1106_2012_acura_tl_sh_awd_ad- - - vance/index.htmlHere is an interesting blurb: ""I appreciate Acura's offering a manual transmission in the TL, but I was not nearly as enamored of it as my colleagues seem to be. Perhaps it felt a little out of place to me because I don't really see Acura as a brand for enthusiasts. Keep making your cars heavier, cancel the development of your V-8 engine, unleash the ZDX on the world, and it's no wonder enthusiasts are more interested in BMW, Audi, and Cadillac these days""This is similar to what I wrote 3 years ago before I got kicked out of a tl chat "

One poster says the CAR is 90% of the Audi. No arguments about the BRAND, but development of a V8, the existence of the ZDX have nothing to do with whether the TL is a good car or not. "
"sweendogy","November 2011"," The article never mentioned the TL as not being good. Infact they said ""When looked at side-by-side with the BMW 3-series, the Volvo S60, or the Cadillac CTS, the TL strikes me as mid-pack at best in terms of performance, refinement, and status and brings up the rear in the looks and sex appeal departments. Although this is a very good car, it lacks emotion and that intangible something that makes it more desirable that its competitors."" "
"markcincinnati","November 2011"," I have no disagreement with anything either you or the professional reviewer said -- I have found, after some 5,000 miles however, that the Acura is more, er, enthusiastic than I would have, could have, imagined.The overall brand, Acura, faces its detractors and challenges. By the time Acrua had a V8 in the market, ""everyone"" would be writing ""why bother"" as even BMW and Audi are moving to fewer cylinders and blown engines instead of naturally aspirated ones.I give nor take any points away from Acura due to its lack of a V8.It remains true, today, however, that Acura is typically not considered an enthusiast's brand. Some of this perception could change however now that Tony Stark is getting an Acura in the new Avenger's movie (who'da thunk he'd turn in his R8?) :surprise: "

Us 99% ers could only dream.Mark- I agree the V8 is no longer needed for the brand. "
"flightnurse","November 2011"," Granted that BMW and MB and Audi are downsizing their engines, however you will notice that in their flagship cars, all have a V8 and will stay that way. Acrua needs a V8 to stay competitive in that market or drop the RL all together "
"markcincinnati","November 2011"," I would assume Audi and BMW (and Merc, Infiniti and Lexus, too) will continue to offer V8's -- why not, they already have them and they are good, often great engines.My point is more to the practical notion that ""what was once a V8 is now a 6"" (either I6 or V6) with a turbo, twin-turbo or super-charger. Likewise, we are increasingly seeing these companies moving from a 6 to a 4, also with forced induction.These changes are being done for a variety of reasons, but the one that seems to get press, is they are using smaller CI engines (with forced induction) to improve the car's efficiency (without sacrificing performance.)Acura may well skirt the ""marketing need"" for more than 6 cylinders by taking the approach of further refining the current 3.7L and then breathing on it, one way or another, to get the HP and torque needed for a flagship vehicle.When I was in Germany I noted the D class cars all over the place, but mostly with smaller engines (an A8 with a V6? yep.) Maybe Acura will pull the covers off of a new ""Honda"" V8 and put it in their flagship car (assuming they can muster, or, better said, WANT to invest in a complete re-do of the RL.)At this point, I care not -- and I have no idea if I will get another Acura.I really like the TL in SH-AWD Advance trim -- but a lesser TL didn't do it for me; so who knows, maybe the next gen Audi (B or C class) will draw me back. In other words, I was passionate about Audi's, but I am much less inclined to be thus insofar as the TL is concerned.The hell of it is, the Acura TL SH-AWD advance is ""more car"" a better performing car (gulp, please forgive me oh Ingolstadt gods) and a more efficient car. Add to that ""everybody"" says Acura's are both reliable AND durable (especially when compared with Audi's, eh?) ""Everybody"" says so, anyway. But this claim, at least, is left to be seen. At 5,000 miles the Acura feels ""new"" (actually better than new now that the engine is a bit looser); but, so did my last 10 Audi's and my wife's last BMW (a 2008 X3 with all the toys on it.)I would tell you my Audi's were reliable (for 50,000 miles), but damn, out of warranty they were breathtakingly expensive to maintain and repair. I have only an opinion as to their durability, and, well, I assume Audi's are simply not as durable as some other cars, once the miles climb well above 50K.So, will Acura survive and THRIVE as an LPS or ELLPS without a V8? Beats the heck outta me -- customer's memories are short and most shoppers will probably be unaware of the lack of a V8 offering (if that is what happens) if there is a buttery smooth, powerful and quiet engine that responds to the touch of the accelerator. Any of these companies is now capable of doing that with 4, 6, 8 or more cylinder engines.Acura needs, more than anything, to figure out what it wants to be when it grows up -- the current ""Advance"" campaign is pretty good, but the entire product line needs a refresh and to keep and build a marketing campaign that imbues the brand with a positive image. Currently, the image, if you asked me, is ""We're the Bucky Beaver Brand"" -- with the exception, perhaps, of the ZDX and who knows what the hell that thing is and who it is supposed to ""speak to.""The current TL is a band-aid -- the upcoming generation of all of their vehicles needs to refine the styling cues across the board and update the technology offered.Hopefully the budget and the will to do this becomes evident.In any case, I'm sticking with the ""who cares about offering a V8?"" theme for them.Drive it like you live. :shades: "
"billyperksii","November 2011"," Sween- its actually E63 AMG or the E550. I only have 13K miles on the TL with 3yrs of payment to go. The Mercedes is not on the radar as yet but you never know when the new car itch sets in- maybe next week.:) "
"flightnurse","November 2011"," No doubt that in Germany (Europe) you will find D class cars with 6 cyl's that to me is a given. First time I was in Germany (1981) I had a 520i. However we all now that a 520i wouldn't sell here in the US. If I could afford it, our next BMW would be the 740i (will settle for a 535i for now) with the ( twin turbo I6) to me that is the uber car to have. For less then 3K, that engine can make 400hp with no problem (with the factory turbo) and be stone reliable, no need for a V8.The RL has been the problem child for Acrua, and why? For me, no flagship car should have a V6 as its only engine, and second, the styling doesn't say Flagship. Yes, we all now the factory;s can make lots of HP from a good 6 cyl but many people want a V8. If I'm off base, I would love to hear why..Tony "
"markcincinnati","November 2011"," I think you are on-base for some (perhaps many); but, the number of folks who want a V8 is on the decline. I don't know how long it will take for this decline to be big enough to really make a V8 irrelevant, but I do believe it will, eventually, happen.I believe most folks care more about the way the car feels when the accelerator is pressed down (a little or a lot.) If the car feels as if it has weapons grade torque, is smooooooth and quiet (except at full cry), and does not require frequent fill-ups or fill ups that rival a car payment, well what the heck. If the car has a 6 and an electric motor and it is able to meet the requirements noted above -- to hell with what is under the hood.In my observation, which is just that, mine, folks that buy the big buck luxury cars (like the A8 or 7 series, or Lexus barges) are often not enthusiasts.I'd take a 5 series for the most fun over a 7, any day -- especially if I were footing the bill to care and feed it.So, no, to repeat, you are not TODAY off base -- but your statement strikes me as being dangerously close to becoming an historical observation, not a current event for too much longer -- now cut a buck off the price of gas, well, maybe.I remain: Often wrong, but never uncertain.Drive it like you live. :shades: "

For me the TSX is a great car, however it needs a new engine, take the engine from the RDX and detune it to about 220hp and have it run on regular gas, this would transform the TSX in the car Arcua needs.If Acrua is going to follow other companies, then the TL needs a turbo I4, if BMW can do it, so can Arcua, at the current RDX turbo and add some HP to it.

Use someone else's money to lease a car and take that $4K and use it for something else.. Lie maybe the stock market..BTW, you asked how do people pay cash for cars... Three ways, they saved up to pay cash, second, made a killing in the stock market or third mommy and or daddy gave them the money. For me it was #1 and #2. When I got out of college, I kept the car I had, a 65 Mustang coupe for about 10 yrs post graduation, at that time I would place $300/m in a savings account, Then bought Harley stock before the stock split (doubled my money) then split again (double it again) and finally split again (doubled it again.) I was able to buy my first BMW cash, and a house in San Diego (this was before the big boom in housing prices) Since then done very well in the stock market and flipping houses (stopped flipping houses for now.) People can buy cars for cash, but there are sacrifices one needs to make to do it. So my 2011 BMW was bought cash as well as the 2005. I take what the money payment would be and stick it in the bank so in 6 years I'll have enough to pay cash for the next one. This is how people pay cash for cars.BTW, the stock market has been very good to flightnurse the past 2 days, got to love when an airline files Chp 11... "
"sweendogy","November 2011"," Nice story- wow - I'm out "
"Kirstie_H","November 2011"," Not everyone can afford to pay cash for each vehicle. However, the key, as in all financial decisions, is to manage your debt. My goal has been to never be upside-down in a vehicle regarding value:debt ratio. Why does the amount have to get bigger? I financed my last car for 5 years (due to unknown future financial circumstances) and paid it off in 4. When that was done, I had a nice downpayment that I chose to use to pay for an entire vehicle in cash. My SO, on the otherhand, has a vehicle he financed for 5 years, almost 4 years into it and it's almost paid off and he intends to keep it. If you're not upside-down and don't have visions of getting the most you can possibly afford, financing is a reasonable solution to not having the full whack.(Stock market was nice to me too, especially Ford, which our stock club bought for something like $4 and sold a few months later for $7) "
"sweendogy","December 2011"," Interesting - what if finance rates were 10% ? Would you have financed or looked for a lesser car? I agree smart thinking needs to go into taking down a material purchase - and given the current environment of higher used car values and lower bank rates are getting people into cars they would not normally afford. Maybe there is more to this... ThoughtsBtw new car sale numbers very strong for the Americans, Germans, toyo an Nissan. Honda still struggling with the flooding problems. "
"Kirstie_H","December 2011"," A lesser car. No one NEEDS a fantastic car. I chose to do that this time around and purchased a ""lesser car"" in lieu of financing, so that I could pay cash. Last time I didn't have quite enough cash for a ""lesser car,"" plus I was driving a WHOLE lot at that point in time. Now I'm not. It was worth it back then to finance, and it didn't come close to stretching my budget. "
"flightnurse","December 2011"," What do you mean if rates were 10%, they are for many people. When you see those ""special"" rates from manufactures they are for ""well qualified"" buyers. Which is terms mean credit score greater then 700.When it comes to keeping up with the Jones, people will pay to say in the car that makes them feel good... It might not be the top of the line model though. "
"sweendogy","December 2011"," Interesting pt, I didn't consider people without super credit. Are people walking in and leasing/financing 40k at 10%plus rates still? Or are theses people now saving, given the current Eco climate? Given recent car sales it would suggest they are not saving. If that's the case we are all in big trouble. "
"tlong","December 2011"," A lesser car. No one NEEDS a fantastic car. I chose to do that this time around and purchased a ""lesser car"" in lieu of financing, so that I could pay cash.I read in an article once that if one person buys a new car every three years, trades in the old one, versus another person who buys a 2 yo car and drives it 10 years, repeatedly, and invests the money saved versus person #1s case, then person #2 will retire at 65 with a $million dollars saved by NOT buying new cars all the time. I'm somewhere in the middle, buying new cars but always driving them 150K miles and 8-10 years or so. But I really do appreciate those who buy/lease new cars often, as it helps the economy. :shades: "
"nyccarguy","December 2011"," I think a lot of us here do have excellent credit that affords us top tier financing, but yes many people out there are taking out 7 - 8 year loans with 10+ % interest. "
"fedlawman","December 2011"," I used to be a new car every 3 years kind of guy. That changed once I had kids and a mortgage. If only more people knew how liberating it feels to pay off a car and keep driving it payment free. Every time I think about owning a new car (Audi TT RS anyone?), I go in the garage and appreciate what I already have.We are a brainwashed, instant gratification, consumer society. "
"shipo","December 2011"," We used to do the new car thing every three years as well. It's hard to point a finger at exactly what changed, but we ended up driving our two previous cars to nearly 200,000 miles each. Funny thing, we now have two relatively new cars (one bought in November of 2008 and one bought last month), and the interest rate on them is so low (2.9% and 1.9% respectively) we would have been foolish to do anything beyond putting the trade-in value of the old car ""down"" on the two new ones. "
"wireless","December 2011"," Are you saying you've gotten better than 1.9/2.9% on your money (that you didn't use to buy the cars) since buying the cars? Where have you got it then? "
"kyfdx","December 2011"," Kept a car for 6-7 years, well after it's paid off.... and leased every three years, with zero down....Can't say that I felt superior to anyone else, either way... If you have good credit and are responsible, then the difference is not that important. It's not a character flaw to buy what you can afford.

"nyccarguy","December 2011"," I completely hear ya on that front my friend. I wrote a check for my 2001 Prelude back in April '02, I financed my '10 TSX (5.65%) when I bought it back in August '09 & refinanced it @ 3.44% a year later. When we bought our '11 Pilot back in May (in anticipation of our baby girl, Whitney who was born on Tuesday), I financed it for 60 months @ 2.9%.I've only got 3 years left on the TSX. As much as I would love to trade it in or sell it one day for a CPO 335xi, I know the smart thing to do is to try & keep it for 10 years (5 w/o payments).Once I pay off the TSX, I'll be able to double up on my Pilot payments & pay that off early.

"sweendogy","December 2011"," Congrats on the kid. Exciting times enjoy. Tsx 2010 wooh - well atleast you have the kid. "
"nyccarguy","December 2011"," Thanks for the kind words guys. Yes, this past Tuesday my wife gave birth to our little princess who happens to be the 1st girl & 3rd child in our family. Sween - buy me a G37X & I'll gladly dump my TSX. If the G37 X would have gotten 1 more stinkin MPG (combined), I would've bought one back in '09. I bought my TSX using a $3500 cash for clunkers credit. "
"sweendogy","December 2011"," I would not call the tsx a clunker but again congrats on the baby girl. They are the best. "
"nyccarguy","December 2011"," The clunker was a 1990 E30 BMW 325iA coupe. It only had 82,000 miles on it, but was neglected. I had a new radiator put in, a new set of tires, & an alignment. The car drove great as a BMW should, but it had trouble passing New York State inspection. After it passed, the mechanic said to me that I should either find a donor engine or start paying him to rip out things & replace them with new parts. I knew it was time to ""throw the towel in."". Cash 4 Clunkers came out & I had a 2007 X3 with 38,000 miles (with a year to go & 45K miles allowed for the lease). I loved the 3 series, but it was out of my price range & too small.I drove a Mini Cooper S w/ a 6 speed & didn't like it at all. The G37X which I really dig didn't meet the gas mileage requirements for me to get the $3500 credit.I drove by the Acura dealer & drove the TSX. I thought it drove like a big, 4 door version of my beloved 2001 Honda Prelude Type SH. I didn't like the electric power steering, but the car was to be my wife's daily driver. It has a huge trunk, room in the back for child safety seats, had thickly bolstered seats, a great engine & transmission combination, transmitted some road feel, I was impressed with the suspension dampening. I bought the car and am extremely happy with it.Is a 328i a better driver's car? Absolutely. Is the G37 a balanced handling road rocket? You bet.Is my TSX 75-80% of those cars on public roads? I certainly think so. "
"flightnurse","December 2011"," When I bought my BMW I was talking to the sales guy he told me that BMW will finance without stellar credit of a score of 640, but you pay, he quoted me about 8%. However used cars are higher. People will buy just to keep up with others. Now an on interesting note, the same sale guy told me that when it comes to the 6 and 7 series cars, he will have more people pay cash for those car then fiance them or lease them. 5 series its a 50/50 split buy vs lease.3 series is 70/30 lease vs buy. "
"sweendogy","December 2011"," Makes sense - would guess 7 series closer to 70 owned vs lease. "
"kdshapiro","December 2011"," People will buy to keep up with others? How about ""I specifically know of a case where my (friends, neighbors, cousins, uncle etc) bought x car because they were jealous that y person bought z car"". Smh. "
"dino001","December 2011"," Possible interpretation is 3-series is ""entry"" level, which attracts more people who don't really have the money, so they buy it on payment and 5-series is already out of reach for them. It would be interesting to know what is percentage of those 3-series leases with terms like 10K/yr with 4K down - that would be a giveaway of ""bologna sandwich budget with caviar taste, I have no money, no clue, but I really want that stuff"" people. "
"dino001","December 2011"," People would not admit that openly. All you can do is read the signs, such as how much they make and how much they buy. I know personally several people who would buy stuff they shouldn't - all on debt. Zero savings, zero hedges, just good stuff in the house and house well beyond what they can afford, too. All they talk about is next boat, next sound system. Then occasionally they mention paying off the debt, but it lasts for about two minutes. "
"sweendogy","December 2011"," Good point- one of the reasons American economy is failing. "
"cdnpinhead","December 2011"," . . .""bologna sandwich budget with caviar taste, I have no money, no clue, but I really want that stuff"" people. Their number is legion.A number of years ago we lived next door to a couple who ""liked nice things."" They, in fact, had many more nice things than we did (or do to this day for that matter), but the next few years demonstrated that having them paid for, such that they could be kept, was a whole 'nother thing. "
"kdshapiro","December 2011"," Leasing a car is like renting an apartment. Neither is bad and both have their place. Buying on credit is a personal decision.But one has to be responsible whether it is a house, car, work of art, etc. And I don't think people spend money irresponsibly to keep up with the jones'. People just spend money irresponsibly. Just look at the foreclosures. "
"dino001","December 2011"," You're right, there can be many motivations. ""Keeping up"" is just one of possibilities. A lot of it may not be linked to particular Jones's, but rather to media image of a successful person. When you looked at lifestyles of characters from many shows and compare with real-life earnings power of their jobs, there is often a large disconnect. However, many people would take that as a validation for their acquisitions. And of course commercials.Finishing on lease - it's not the lease itself that is a giveaway, it's the terms. If somebody leases at 0 down for mileage they are actually driving then that's a choice, when they put 4 grand down, 10K miles/year and their commute is 15 miles each way, you know that having car on the driveway was more important that actually driving it. Don't get me wrong - it's their money (or in some cases - it's their not having the money) and their choice to make. But if they wanted to borrow 10 bucks from me, I would automatically assume the likely actual choice here is losing 10 bucks or losing their graces. "
"sweendogy","December 2011"," with the new 328 coming out soon - and sporting a 4cyl engine, that outperforms the current 6, does this change the way we look at this ELLPS foruM?

"shipo","December 2011"," ""BMW doesn't use V6, it uses I6 (six in line).""My point exactly. Unfortunately it seems this is about to change as BMW will start using blown V6 engines for the next generation of M3s. "
"markcincinnati","December 2011"," A friend of mine frequently uses the phrase: ""There's no replacement for displacement."" He is appalled at the number of cars that may offer more than 6 cylinders but rarely sell (or stock) anything other than ""blown"" I4's, I6's or V6's (both naturally aspirated and forced induction.)I tell him that there IS a replacement for displacement and that it is ""volumetric efficiency.""The 211HP 258 pound feet I4 in my 2009 A4 was both quick and fast -- with a 6spd automatic; in the new A4's the engine's rating remains but the car is even quicker, faster and more efficient due to an 8spd automatic. In favor of the V8 S4, Audi switched to a super-charged V6; in the S8 Audi has elected to drop 2 cylinders (from 10 to 8) and produce an engine that is both more efficient and more powerful -- considering its size the S8 is a sipper, not a guzzler.Only one Acura engine is boosted (the I4 in the RDX), and as far as I know there are no Infiniti engines that are either super or turbo charged.The V6 in my 2012 Acura is, frankly, pretty much a basic (but buttery smooth) fuel injected V6 of the modern era. I was wondering what would happen if Acura (Honda) would change to FSI (fuel stratified injection) and super or turbo charge it? Seems to me that with very little effort the engine used today if brought to the current state of the blown art, would put out at least 20% more HP and 10% more torque all the while showing perhaps another +2 MPG's. Then, if they would upgrade the fine 6 speed auto to a current gen 8 speed, any Acura so blessed would go from its current potency (which is very good and is, at this time, Acura's most powerful engine [the 3.7, i.e.]) to high output potency -- in the engine department -- coupled with always being near or at the operating sweet spot due to the increase in the number of gears.Think if Infiniti, currently without any forced induction engine offerings, were to begin offering their engines with a super or turbo charger (and also keeping their 7 speed autos) -- makes my head spin.The Germans (and even the CTS-V) would have something more to worry about, with all these G's, M's, TL's and RL's armed for bear.Will Acura or Infiniti ever up their engine game to this level, or will they take down-tuned engines and alter their breathing and computer maps to get them slightly better than they are now with a touch more grunt in the 0-60 dept? BTW, Infiniti already has a V8, so its creds don't need much engineering brain-power to at least be able to claim ""we have V8's"" even as they are bested by their very own 6's and 4's.I used to assume the car mfgrs read the engthusiasts magazines and the postings here on Edmunds and elsewhere. But, apparentely they don't. If they did and if they were swayed by what is said in both places, well you think they would pay attention and respond (even if only a little bit) to some of the legitmate critiques made by the authors.Audi and BMW are unlikely to loose credibility from a ""sporting intentioned"" family perspective. If someone want's to be certain their car hails from a lineage that includes ""winners"" and a widely accepted high performance heritage, look no further.Acura, perhaps standing all alone, may be shooed from the ELLPS (a.k.a. Premium) board and ""chat room"" based on its historic but currently all but gone lack of focus. Yet the perception that Acura is a bit fuzzy in the perception of premium department remains for them. The ZDX certainly didn't help and allowing the RL to, more or less, atrophy away hasn't helped either. Of all of these car brands, Acura is in the most peril of losing its way.Infiniti and Lexus are mostly safe bets to perservere as players in the ELLPS and LPS field, from what I can tell (although Lexus seems much more the luxury choice than the performance choice, but they are doing a yeoman's job to make this perception go away somewhat.)Mercedes, too, a safe bet if what you really want is a bonafide member of the LPS club.Volvo is, for the most part, doing what I think Acrua should do -- and that is building a performance image to go hand-in-hand with their safety image. They are about in the same position as Acura, the primary difference is Volvo seems to be really trying to put on a performance face these days.Finally the iconic American brand, Cadillac, has demonstrated, these past 3 - 5 years, a penchant for creating an image that may not quite be able to stand toe-to-toe with BMW or Mercedes, for example, but they do keep sneaking up on it with ever more interesting designs and power plants -- including volumetrically enhanced (super-charged) models like the CTS-V.We are in a time of inflection -- 2013 model cars are right around the corner and they continue to excite and delight (with the possible exception of Acura). So here I sit a guy with a history of 29 Audi's, 3 BMW's, 3 VW's and 1 Acura -- wondering why in the hell I got the Acura. But, truth be told, the Acura is not a boring drive, quite the contrary in fact; however, it is somewhat boring to look at and, that more than anything, may be the crux of the matter. :confuse: "
"dino001","December 2011"," New fuel efficiency standards pushed German manufacturers into new areas of smaller blown engines. It's probably both US and Euro driven. I don't think BMW is going I4 turbo because they want to. They do it because they have to.It makes me wonder if lack of such moves on part of Lexus, Infiniti and Acura is because they are considered parts of their parent companies' fleets. If this is the case, it would give them distinct advantage, as lux customer doesn't care about fuel efficiency to same extent as non-luxury. It's not completely non-issue, but it is not a big one. "
"nyccarguy","December 2011"," My thoughts on my 2010 TSX sort of echo some of your feelings toward your TL SH-AWD. The engine/transmission combination is very smooth. They feel perfectly matched together. I don't oogle over the styling of my TSX like say a 335i w/ M Sport Package, but its design is handsome & far from boring.Could my TSX use more power via DI, FSI, Turbo, or Supercharging? Yes, but then how much torque could the front wheels handle? Would Acura's SH-AWD add too much as far as weight (& price) to its current entry level price tag without stealing sales from the base FWD TL?I'm happy with my TSX. "
"markcincinnati","December 2011"," The TL should only be sold in AWD trim, IMHO. According to my Ohio dealers, most of the TL's sold are Tech SH-AWD's anyway. I think Acura should do what Audi does in the US -- sell AWD cars (99% anyway) period.Content and price them with options and packages that make sense, but don't push massive amounts of technology in one package. In other words, offer a basic version of the cars (but ONLY in AWD trim.) SH-AWD is damn near magic, it totally transforms the basic FWD car into a really believable ELLPS car. My dealers claim they sell mostly MDX's anyway, so Acura already seems to have at least the possibility of being all AWD all the time like Audi.With the FWD models clouding the message, it seems Acura's sometimes are more like VW's than Audis, yet Acura has essentially stated it wants to be in the Premium class and that it wants to model itself on Audi.I assume this makes sense since VW begat Audi and Honda begat Acura. Audi morphed (in the us) to the ""quattro"" company and claims to be the reigning champeen of AWD cars (with the most history, don't you know?) Audi has essentially eschewed FWD cars (in North America) in favor of AWD cars in order to be taken seriously as a contender in the Premium class -- where only RWD and AWD are taken seriously, it's in all the papers.Acura keeps hanging on to its Honda roots where it's good AND where it's not so good, premium perception-wise. Audi, morphed from FWD to FWD and/or AWD to AWD, period. They entered and won contests and races and Wards awards and other awards, but these awards and the spoils of winning were all accomplished with their AWD versions. Although I guess you could buy an FWD A4 or A6, I don't know where you go to actually find one in the flesh for sale at a dealer.And Audi did wonder ""how much power can one put throught the front wheels"" -- its answer was ""not enough, so we need to put MORE power through the front AND rear wheels."" And they are where they are now by taking the risk of virtually dropping FWD from the NA market.And what happened next? BMW brought out the 325 (in 1988 (?) as I recall, since I had one) with AWD; then Mercedes started offering AWD here and there. Acura, Infiniti, Lexus, Volvo, VW, Cadillac, Buick and, and, and, the list goes on to cover every LPS and LPS wannabe brand and product. As to the price impact -- I think it would be pretty easy to keep the price of an all SH-AWD fleet at about the current FWD models + $1,500; for the safety and performance this would offer, to say nothing of an image enhancement similar to that which Audi enjoyed, it is probably not a show stopper for the company.And, most of us shopping in this class will probably not reject a new Acura that is exclusively offered with SH-AWD. For most, it ought to be a no-brainer.I have nothing against FWD, btw, I just think it would be very helpful to Acura if it has the goal of remaining a serious premium class brand, to completely ditch any and all FWD offerings from its lineup.  :surprise: "
"shipo","December 2011"," Funny thing, for my current needs, wants and desires, the ""perfect"" car for me right-now-today would be an Audi A3 RWD (sacrilege I know, but I want it none-the-less) with a hotted up 2.0T and a 6-Speed manual. Of course no such a critter will ever exist, but one can dream can't one. :blush: "
"dino001","December 2011"," I think Acura should do what Audi does in the US -- sell AWD cars (99% anyway) period. That's not entirely accurate. A3s and A4s are sold here mostly in FWD (Tampa). I asked a salesguy about it once. He surprised me. To Audi without AWD is like nonalcoholic beer or worse. "
"sweendogy","December 2011"," While I agree Acura should ""advance"" I feel they do not need to completely change to awd. They did very well in the 90 and 2000s with a front wheel drive setup.

"nyccarguy","December 2011"," I think that's an excellent idea. Definitely a great way to differentiate Acura from its Honda roots. Buyers here in the northeast & new England will buy anything and everything AWD. Give my TSX a turbo, SH AWD, & excellent brakes (the oem brakes are pathetic) & I'd give it another look. "
"markcincinnati","December 2011"," If my message somehow went too far, I apologize -- I do not believe that moving to an all AWD line-up (or 99%, as in the case of Audi -- and in the case of Audi it is 100% of their advertising) will alone re-position Acura in the minds of the intended customers.As I mentioned in my earlier post, the crux of the issue is not how these cars drive (if the 2012 TL Advance SH-AWD is any indicator), they are not a boring drive, not an incompetent drive, nor lacking in performance. The thing is the cars are pretty much not very attractive -- even if they do get bonus points for trying to look different.They have the driving thing in pretty good shape as far as I'm concerned -- they need to modernize the engines and look at the content that is offered by every car brand/product they wish to emulate and be guided accordingly.They need to consider making themselves perceived solely as an AWD company and they need an across the board styling transplant or upgrade asap.Probably more than any other step they could take, styling is the one that will bear the most fruit. For, no matter how much they up their game in the performance or content arena, people need something to draw them to the showroom and something to feel good about after they buy.My '12 TL is ""better"" in so many ways than my '09 A4 -- which was the first year for the change to the B8 platform for Audi. I would not expect this to remain thus -- a refreshed A4, most likely, will again be more attractive (in all the above ways) than the current TL (from a design perspective mainly.)You don't have to agree with the magazines, but the current A6, which looks very much like a larger B8, A4, is winning friends, awards wise. No Acura is on any list I can find. BMW, too, remains a repeat top choice amongst those who award wins for being great.Acura simply needs a style-ectomy, soon. :sick: "
"sweendogy","December 2011"," Style I agree - I also think they need to go cheaper to find youth buyers. We have heard from owners that the TSX is a great value - but it's still 30k an bulk of the buyers are older people- make a 25k coupe with a power 4 that gets youth in the door. All in you can't pick a car under the Acura nameplate that says look at me - ""I'm rediculously good looking"" - and that's a major problem. Love the traction this is finally getting - its time to release the TsX from this Elpps chat once and all as a lesson to Acura you can't stand around for 10 years and do nothing in an evolving car biz. (sorry for typos, iPhone) "
"nyccarguy","December 2011"," Sween - I agree with you & Mark that the Acura lineup definitely needs a makeover. You are right that none of the models scream ""I gotta have it.""Like I said, my TSX is handsome (IMHO) but its styling doesn't compare to BMW, Audi, MB.Practicality, Luxury, & Technology are driving people into Acura showrooms rather than style & performance. "
"markcincinnati","December 2011"," Isn't the upcoming RSX supposed to come in at a lower price point? Of course then there's the issue that the TSX is supposedly a cancelled product and that the TL will shrink in size.But if you can at least suggest that you can offer a lower entry point, price-wise, you may find you attract more and younger customers. Truth be told the TL is actually much bigger feeling than my outgoing A4, which did, technically, have a longer wheel-base, but the TL is wider.Again, we seem to be in violent agreement, Acura needs an overall styling cue that is spread across all cars and, first and foremost, is attractive.You may or may not like the look of an Audi, but the entire line from the lowest cost A3 to the big buck A8L or R8 all have cues that they are Audi's.BMW, ditto.Acura is trying with their beak front end, but it obviously wasn't working for them, considering the plastic surgery the TL just underwent.C'mon let's make some good looking cars -- at all price points! "
"ivan_99","December 2011"," C'mon let's make some good looking cars -- at all price points!...any KIA (Rio starting at 13k).To me it seemed like the Acura beak was trying to imitate the Cadillac shield...but it ended up looking to thick and plasticky... "
"nyccarguy","December 2011"," I don't know how much lower the price of an entry level Acura can go. I think the average new car price is $30K. The $30K price point is the new $20K price point of 15 years ago. "
"dino001","December 2011"," They should have never ditched RSX. That would have been a great $25K+ entry with $28K-30K Type S. Small overlap with top of Civic with extra zip (make base engine 10 hp stronger) and equipment.Honda must be experiencing some big internal struggles that we don't know about. Just look at latest Civic and Accord. The ""sportyish"" DNA is all but gone, virtually no trace. I recently a rented Accord (yes, I was surpirised myself - Hertz had Accord in their rental fleet). Mechanicals were adequate, but the car did not impress me at all. Really cheap interior, barge look, even some ergonomics were not so great (always strong suit of Japanese cars). Long story short, if I were in market for family midsize sedan, Accord may not even make the short list. "
"sweendogy","December 2011"," Mark- I have no details on the new Rsx- which as am ex integra gs-r owner I had no interest in- car was not that excitingly all- the integra had the ns-x to look up to plus my gs-r was close to the type r that was very rare and wanted by anyone under 28 years old. NYCcarguy- the death of the Rsx and the no entry point at mid 20ks is a problem- the 4 door current TSx is boring - no other term to use- its a nice safe play but 95% are auto an 97% come with the 4 that is taxed in its current form. They have alot of holes, no supercar, no coupe, no convert, Zdx, a turbo 4 that gets terrible Mpgs, ugly Tl, tsx thats bloated, Zdx and the fact that it's current line does not have one car people have to own (see sonata). Yes I mentioned the Zdx 2 times- it seats 4, weights more then the mdx, ugly and has the sr engine as then mdx- also its overpriced .Acura is the new Buick. Buick is the new startup. Acura has 2 choices given recent sales numbers - die or redue. Acura has a choice to make - let's hope they choose wisely. "

When I bought my TL in '04, the TL was among the best looking sedans out there, they had the tight, nimble, and pretty good looking TSX, they had the RSX, they had the original better looking MDX. Then they bloated and uglied up the whole line, and dropped the RSX. A bunch of steps backwards. No wonder they are slipping in sales. Honda has really lost its way. "
"sweendogy","December 2011"," Yep - I think both last generation tl and tsx were good cars- they looked the part - didnt dare challenge, because Acura was smart and didn't include them in the conversation with real lux sports cars.

"flightnurse","December 2011"," Funny you should ask that questions. Now this is at Camelback BMW (here in PHX) the sales guy tells me that he lease's about 3-4 of those uber low monthly payments 3 series to people who shouldn't own one.

"flightnurse","December 2011"," I read a review on the new 2012 Z4 with this new engine, I was impressed that the Z4 is a better car with the turbo 4, its faster, a more balanced car and did get better mileage then with the old 3 liter 6. Now one would hope that the new 3 series will have the same benefit as the Z4. Also, turners will start to play with the new engine and we will see the HP rating go up, now if they can get the engine to produce 300hp and 300lbs of torque and be reliable then why buy the 335...ALso MB had a 4 cl in thier C class for many years and dropped it for a small V6, will MB go back to a entry level 4 cl?

"nyccarguy","December 2011"," I understand the new Turbo 4 weighs less than the outgoing I6. I know that aides primarily in handling & balance & all that good stuff. How much better fuel economy does it get? How much of the better fuel economy is due to the 4cyl engine & how much is due to the new 8 speed auto? Look at the numbers of the 2011 528i vs. the 2012 528i. "

That said, if you look at the two posts concerned, you'll see the timestamp of his original post is eleven minutes after my post which is immediately below his. "
"shipo","December 2011"," While the numbers aren't official yet, I have it on good authority (remember, I used to live literally down the street from BMW-NA and still have lots of friends in the neighborhood) that the new 328i will return a real-world ""high thirties"" on the highway. As for what the EPA tests will report, that has yet to be seen. "
"qbrozen","December 2011"," That would be very impressive. "
"shipo","December 2011"," I agree, and oh geez do I want one with a sweet shifting 6-Speed manual.  "
"nyccarguy","December 2011"," I know BMWs typically exceed their published numbers whether it be EPA fuel economy estimates, horsepower & torque claims... Especially after break in.It is very cool that the new Blown 4cyl 3 is impressing the brass @ BMWNA. I'm excited for a 6 speed stick version too. I'm also really impressed with the sub 6 second 0-60 time. I can't wait until BMW puts this thing up on their build your own on their website. "
"dino001","December 2011"," I still rather have NA straight 6. Perhaps if (when) gas goes to 5-6 buck a gallon, I'll change my mind. I basically decided to jump in and get one before new 328, exactly because of the four cylinder replacing base six in 328 (got the wagon, so no 335i on that, plus 50K+ after some options still too much for me). Boy, what a sweet machine - drove it in Germany on Autobahn, got to 138 mph before traffic stopped me. Now waiting for delivery in Spartanburg - probably in January. Don't care about lower gas mileage, don't care about lower weight, higher power/torque. I just wanted that NA straight six - it's probably one of the best engines in the history. And I bet BMW would never have changed, if not for the new CAFE.I had enough four cylinder turbos - 2002 WRX and 2008 WRX STI, which are boxers, inherently better configurations that straight four. Fast, great handling, in some aspects may better than 328 (allows faster corner entry and maintains that speed throughout). Still - I just wanted more ""adult"" car than my STI, was ready to give up some power and even some handling. To me BMW 3-series was always about two things: weight distribution (50/50) and straight six. The 328 I just bought had interior that is just OK, but it looks like it was designed thirty minutes before the car was to be released - give some nice leather and wood inlays, add dashboard from 1989 and you're done. The car overcomes that in those mechanical aspects, but take of of them away and other choices become very compelling. Audis are so much better looking(by a mile) both inside and out, have better equipment, cheaper. Or being a little on frugal side, I may get even lower to TSX (not sure about that, but would give it a try) or even Volvo V50. To me BMW voluntarily gave up something they had over their competition. They better make it up in other areas - or else. "
"qbrozen","December 2011"," Not all engines are created equal, though. You can't condemn all 4-cyl turbos based on your subaru experience. The turbo boxer 4 is actually quite coarse compared to, say, the 2 liter VW turbo. That same 2 liter is also smoother and much more flexible than Volvo's I5 turbo. So you should really withold judgegment until you try it. "
"dino001","December 2011"," That's not what I meant. Actually Subaru boxers are great. Exhaust note is almost as intoxicating as that on the BMW's six. But I have not met I4 that I was impressed with. To me they all sound like sewing machines. They may be quiter (some) or more powerful than those from Subaru (not many, esp. STI), but it usually comes with high cost (counterweight balance shafts). Boxer is naturally balanced, just like straight six and offers low CG. No, I'd rather have the H4, or even I5 before I would get I4. But more important - I got I6, which is what all I wanted for now. :shades: "

Act as if. "
"markcincinnati","December 2011"," According to the web-zine, Winding Road: their review of the new I4 turbo makes me feel that one would not feel slighted having a BMW with this motor, quite the contrary. Their comments about the new larger 3 series, also encouraging. "
"shipo","December 2011"," Agreed. All else being equal I'd opt for a normally aspirated I6 over a blown I4, however, all else ain't even close to being equal. Specifically: - The I4 Turbo has more maximum power and torque, and a substantially wider/flatter power band. - The I4 Turbo weighs significantly less than the I6 which will aid in handling and fuel economy. - The I4 Turbo is shorter (albeit wider by virtue of the turbo and its requisite plumbing) than the I6, and as such is easier to package which should in turn make service easier. - The I4 Turbo returns significantly better fuel economy.This is not to discount the fact that I6 motors are naturally balanced and have virtually no torque reversal events (of which there are two for every rotation of a 4-Cylinder/4-Stroke engine), and as such are naturally smoother both in operation and in power delivery. That said, the portion of the roughness of an I4 which is attributable to the engine's natural imbalance is A) relatively minor due to its 2.0 liter displacement (the threshold beyond which balance shafts become increasingly necessary), and are easily cancelled via a relatively small/light weight set of balance shafts.Long story short, take a drive in a late model GTI or A3 (or A4 or A5) 2.0T and try and find something objectionable about the power delivery vis-?-vis a late model 328i. I've now had two I6 BMWs; the engine in my wife's new GTI is easily on par with the unit installed in both of my mounts from Munich. "
"flightnurse","December 2011"," Mileage I haven't heard yet from anyone who has a new 528i or Z4, but in theory it should get better mileage, however its a realitive thing if you are always in the boost then mileage is going to suck. "
"flightnurse","December 2011"," Shipo this is encouraging to hear, but when your friends say high 30's they can't mean 37 or 38 on highway. IF true, this would throw a big wrench in both the hybrid world and thier own diesel 3 series. BTW, I think the 3 series BMW is a true wolf in sheep clothing, drove one and loved it, however the price tag to enter I couldn't justify. "
"flightnurse","December 2011"," Why is it easy to pile miles on in AZ, say Austin or Tampa? Since I live in Phoenix, I hardly drive many miles (I'm usually in another city working) however when I was working in Phoenix, I didn't but more miles then when I lived in San Diego. "
"shipo","December 2011"," The highway MPG number that I've heard bandied about is just what you suggested, 37 to 38. That said, I don't think it will be much of a show-stopper for the new 320d (either version) because, while the numbers are harder to squeeze out of those in the know, very high forties or low fifties are what I'm led to believe. "
"busiris","December 2011"," According to info posted about the new Z4 sDrive 28i on www.fueleconomy.gov, its estimated to get 33mpg hwy, with the new 8 speed transmission.While I would never say never, I don't see how a larger car will use the same, or very similar running gear and do better than the Z4. I can't see the high 30's... At best, the very low 30's, which is still nothing to whine about, IMO. "
"kdshapiro","December 2011"," When I go there, I normally put 50'to 100 miles a day on my car. If I worked in Phoenix I would commute 80 miles r/t. To me that's piling on the miles. "
"shipo","December 2011"," The numbers I've been quoted are for RWD and Manual Transmission equipped F30 328i models; in the case of the Z4 this configuration yields 34 mpg on the highway. That said, my understanding is that while the engine in the 2012 Z4 is the same basic engine, the unit which will find its way into the F30 has a few changes. As I understand things, the new engine should deliver slightly more power and better fuel economy.Time will tell.  "
"sweendogy","December 2011"," With the added power, better Mpgs and it being a little bit lighter - question will be why would anyone buy a 335 ? Performance wise they are very similar reading car and driver- they can both be set with the m package- plus Mpgs in the mid 30s highway ... Won't be long before BMW bumps the HP on the 335 I would guess. "

Tune the suspensions for comfort rather than handling prowess?The Acura statement says something about getting away from Honda -- yet two of the 5 cars will be tarted up Hondas (which may be a good thing since the price will, apparently, be low -- but no SH-AWD?) Bummer.Well, I think the performance of the '12 TL 3.7 SH-AWD Advance is very Audi-like -- will Acura hold the line and NOT improve this, or will the new TL (whatever it may be called) be tuned for a more Buick like ride and not be granted direct injection or a turbo or super-charger (option).Stating that you WANT to be the best second tier car you can be seems akin to (almost) throwing in the towel.My wife, lusting for an MDX to replace her FX35 (for the SH-AWD) is rethinking this now.I am wondering if my '12 is my first and last Acura?32 months to go.

"markcincinnati","December 2011"," We can talk about ALMOST anything we want on this particular forum -- and unless we wander too far off subject or get rude and crude or start making ad hominem statements to others, well, it seems to be tolerated.At the moment, my interests are somewhat of a strategic or future nature; I am wondering what in the wide wide world of sports Acura means by its statement that it will ""de-emphacize""performance (at least that is how it read to me.) Sure, we're talking about ELLPS cars here, but I don't think that suggests that we're not interested in performance.I am interested in these cars, at this point in time, due to the fact that they give their owners most of the """"L"" of the LPS cars and almost all of the ""P"" (or at least they seem to have up until now.) If Acura wants to no longer persue ""P"" does that mean they will focus more on ""L""? I mean how can you remain in the Premium class if you are not either heavy on the ""L"" (Lexus and often Mercedes comes to mind) or heavy on the ""P"" (and Audi and BMW -- and sometimes even Cadillac -- spring to mind).It seems Acura is attempting to prep me (if I can be prepped, that is) to accept ""good cars,"" since we're no longer going to even try to make great cars (insofar as lux and/or performance is concerned.)The 2012 TL SH-AWD Advance seems to embody a lot of performance and a lot of luxury (in the ELLPS world, I mean) at a good price. My TL's content for the dollar seems high -- considering, too, that Acura seems more willing to deal on the selling price than, say, Volvo or Audi.As I read the variety of ""press release"" type of communications coming out of Acura these past couple of days, they seem to be saying -- we're going to have 5 really good cars and 1 super car to choose from. We are going to build, mostly, ""really good cars"" -- we're going to focus on value, green-ness and that Acura DNA (whatever that is). They continue by saying, ""Our customers tell us they don't buy our cars first and foremost for performance -- and even a great sound system is #5 on our surveyed customer's list.""I am interested in hearing from you on this topic and others and about other manufacturers. Hell, I'd bet I've had more Audis that the vast majority of folks and I would be glad, damn glad, to chat and opine and bloviate on that subject too.Let's get back to talking about the cars.

"markcincinnati","December 2011"," I am guilty of being:Often wrong. . .but. . .Never uncertain.My ""take"" on Acura is based soley on what I read (in the present tense) and what I have read (previously.) I read, with a dubious eye, the Automobile magazine article wherein an Audi S4 was ""tested against"" an Acura TL SH-AWD. No way you say?I recall my initial reaction as, ""yea, sure the two cars finished neck-and-neck, pull the other one."" Read the article for yourself -- just google it.Sitting there on my couch reading the Automobile article as a person who was at the time driving his 29th Audi (that either my wife, my company or I had either leased or purchased) since 1977 and also knowing that I was soon due to turn in my 2009 Audi A4 2.0T quattro sport, I thought, ""I'll test drive all the ELLPS cars that I can, and that includes the TL.""It didn't hurt any that Motor Week also had a favorable take on the 2012 TL 3.7 AWD as did most of the automobile magazines I subscribe to (Automobile, Car & Driver, Motor Trend and Road & Track) and read (add to the list European Car and Popular Mechanics.)My wife after 3 BMW's (and many Audi's) had leased an Infiniti FX35 AWD Premium last December; and, since we had spent some time at the Infiniti dealer here in Cincinnati, I had taken several G's and M's out for at least four test drives to see if they really were the ""Japanese BMW's."" For the most part, they are, I discovered.So you see, I had read all the magazines, participated in the Audiworld and Edmunds forums for years and had started test driving cars in the ELLPS and LPS class. I was um, an ""amateur expert"" on the subject matter. The confluence and influence of all the above events got me to test drive an Acura MDX, RDX, ZDX and TL SH-AWD [Advance], an Audi A4 2.0T [Prestige], S4 ('11) [Premium Plus], A5, A6 ('11 and '12) and A7, a BMW 3X, 5X, X3, X5 and X6, a Cadillac CTS/4 3.6 Performance Luxury, a Honda Crosstour, an Infiniti G37X and M37X, a Volvo S60 T6 and a VW Passat CC with the VR6 engine/AWD and a VW Toureg. I probably test drove some other cars like a Taurus SHO, a Genesis and a Jeep Grand w/a Hemi, but they were never really something I took seriously.What got me off the ""I GOTTA have another Audi"" mind-set was the back to back to back to back test drives of a pair of Infinitis (the G and M), an '11 Audi S4, the Cadillac CTS and the '12 Acura TL. As I recall the order of the tests, the only fact of significance was the fact that I reluctantly, more or less, tested the TL after I had tested the S4 and the CTS.Other than the lack of interior grab handles for the front seat passengers (which I consider a very important feature for Cadillac to have overlooked), the Cadillac was, er, sublime -- an American Luxury Performance Sedan; the S4 was also very impressive and typifies the German Performance Luxury Sedan -- and the Acura TL SH-AWD Advance (which had the ""benefit"" of my low expectations) which, from the driver's seat, actually seemed ""about as quiet as the Cadillac"" and ""about as HOT as the Audi S4."" What?!? Blasphemy!If you've taken back to back to back test drives --over the IDENTICAL route, playing the IDENTICAL CD on the sound system and pushing the cars into corners at IDENTICAL speeds -- you will understand how it is possible to see cars you might only have test driven for a lark in a whole new light.Standouts in the entire bunch (w/o regard to price): the TL, S4, A7, BMW 335 w/x-drive, the M37X w/Technology Package, and the S60 T6. The CTS and the CC get a ""quite nice"" rating. If money were no object, I'd probably go for the A7 Prestige or S4 w/sport differential (think of that as the German SH-AWD -- aka torque vectoring.) If money were REALLY no object, I'd probably wait for the upcoming Audi S8 and learn to smoke cigars and swill cognac or grappa.Money being an object, I narrowed my choices down a bit, but was able to strongly consider an M37X (due to fantastic lease deals) and a '12 Audi A4 2.0T Prestige w/sport pkg. I also considered the Volvo but found them totally unwilling to budge off of sticker (or $1,000 off.) Just because the '12 TL SH-AWD Advance was the sleeper of the bunch (in terms of performance), priced right (at $47,000 as I wanted it) and had enjoyed the Automobile S4 vs TL comparison article, I kept it on my list.Well cut off my legs and call me shorty -- the TL came in at 87% of MSRP, a low money factor and no-wait for it to be shipped from Europe (it is made here in Ohio) -- no other car even came close to the ""value"" the TL presented.I, at the time, ONE time (so far), turned my back on Audi and took the plunge into a non-German car. The Acura TL does NOT blow me away like the S4 or A7, for instance. Yet, like some wines, the TL does seem to be impressing me more as it ""ages"" (miles). I do not consider it to be an Audi S4 clone, even though the Automobile article is very complimentary of the TL's performance vs the Audi's. The TL is, as I have written elsewhere, ""close to fine"" (as if ""fine"" is a destination.)I now am at a place where I will probably consider Acura again based on my current experience. Yet the recent press releases about the upcoming Acura line-up is a cause for concern. They seem to be saying, ""we're giving up on being a tier-1 Premium Car Company."" Time will tell.If you have not test driven (i.e., a good long test drive) the TL Advance SH-AWD (and ONLY the Advance SH-AWD, not the lesser configurations, and certainly not the FWD version, period) and you are looking to purchase a new car from the ELLPS line-up, I do encourage you to take the long test drive -- even if the somewhat beaky styling puts you off -- of the TL Advance SH-AWD, back to back to back with the cars you are more seriously considering. What can it hurt?The TL's styling may be too much for you to overcome and perhaps the price I got was a fluke or a once in a lifetime deal -- hence the TL will remain unattractive to YOU no matter how impressively it may perform. Perhaps too, you are a cash buyer and then the Volvo may merit more consideration (I was interested in the lowest lease price I could get and the Acura's discount and money factor were compelling.)In any case, as I have said, what could it hurt to spend a day test-flogging, or, test-driving three or four very nice cars, including, just for the fun of it, the Acura TL Advance SH-AWD.Drive it like you live.

"sweendogy","December 2011"," http://drivetofive.wordpress.com/im guilty of being honest and speaking the truth.Above is an article about a man and his car- we all talk about current cars belonging in the group, some very clear, others not so much- but its pretty clear to me reading this blog and knowing the car he rides and talks of - this was one of the pioneers for this group- and to see what the brand has become over those 500k miles disheartens me. I remember once I got a license 16 years ago the car I wanted was a legend coupe 6 speed, with the souped up Type2? Engine. I settled for a 89 maxima which in itself was a great car but not the looker the Acura. My first new car was a 2000 Acura integra gs-r coupe- redline was almost 9k Rpms and I took it to that level every day- loved the car and the service. After the 3 year lease it was time to get a 4 door, the original TSX was on the short list and after long debate I bought a jetta gli- 200hp and at the time (2003) it had the vr6 and a 6 speed- it was a close call but price won out. After that day I have never stepped into another Acura dealership- the passion is lost- along with sales numbers. I'm still on acura's mailing list -the email lists exciting developments for the 2012 auto show- lets hope they finally deliver. sorry for long post.http://links.mkt015.com/servlet/MailView?ms=MzgyMjY3OAS2&r=MjU1MzkxNzYzNjMS1&j=M- - TE4MjM3NDcyS0&mt=1&rt=0Always right, always certain, always do homeworksween "

"fedlawman","December 2011","  I wanted a Legend so badly when it first came out. And the 2nd gen Legend Coupe - still gorgeous even today.When I was in college my girlfriend's dad had a Vigor. I thought it was very nice at the time too.The TSX is very much like a modern day Vigor - only it performs better in every way.It's not that Acura has lost it's way. The TSX, TL, RL were a very logical lineup for a near-luxury brand. Time has simply marched on and Acura hasn't kept up. They cannot use the Accord as a platform for their entire lineup any longer, and they cannot market any Civic-based car as an Acura.A three-car lineup moved upmarket is what Acura needs to compete. Make the TL the entry-level sedan with a choice of engines (base car would be FWD 240 hp I-4 turbo from the RDX, top would be AWD with the 3.5L V-6). Next the RL should be a RWD and AWD 5/7 Series competitor (base engine the 3.5L V-6 and top engine a V-8). Finally, introduce a small RWD luxury-sports coupe/convertible (think M-B SLK or Lexus SC). Same engines as the Legend, but smaller and lighter. "
"wireless","December 2011"," They need to work on their styling first. That's half the battle. I saw a new Acura TL coming and going with the beak/grimace fore and aft. It's ust cringeworthy.

"dino001","December 2011"," If Audi can its sell Golf-based A3, so could Acura sell Civic-based RSX, RIP. The problem is packaging and pricing. There has to be enough separation between the vehicles.I think TL is a nice vehicle. Don't really care for its nose styling, but that can be fixed. Same with TSX. The problem is at the top - RL is on verge of being irrelevant. I have not seen one in months. However, their main problem is the line - it's just too short. Their ""all inclusive"" approach is great for people looking for a good trade-up deal, but does not impress people with money looking to be awed. No coupe, no convertible, no buzz-creating (albeit not necessarily profitable) supercar, no exciting supersedan - that's a big problem for an aspiring luxury manufacturer. Too little choice - premium market likes choice. People with money like to be different from others. Even Lexus has long lines on different packages on their cars. I think biggest problem for Acura is Honda'a accountants - they probably don't give them enough to develop a real luxury lineup. To understand why one has to look at Honda as a company, where automobiles are just a part of a much bigger structure, within which Acura is just a small line in corporate balance sheet. "

"fkong","December 2011"," I recently leased an IS350 F-Sport. Before making this decision, I also looked at a few other cars, and will let you guys know why I went with the big L. Even my brother was excited that I got the IS350, versus any of the other cars.Acura TL - I did consider this car. I actually do find the car to be quite attractive. But, I find that it's a bit huge. Plus, why this car isn't RWD is a whole new story, and I don't want AWD. I can accept the front beak problem.Audi A4 - Audi's never really appealed to me. Don't get me wrong, they're nice. My brother has an A6 that I do find some beauty in, but they just aren't my cup of tea. And, same situation with the Acura, why isn't it RWD?BMW 3-series - Cost more than my IS350 F-Sport to begin with (almost $47k for the 328i w/ M-Sport package, Nav, auto, parking sensors) versus my car (F-Sport package, Nav, Backup camera, auto, NO parking sensors). Chances are, if I want the 335, it'll be more than $50k. Plus, I don't want to look like every other guy on the street. I'm in So Cal, and the 3-series are more popular than Camry's here.Cadillac CTS - I wanted to buy American, but America's definition of luxury involves the use of low end materials. I do like the car, though.Infiniti G37 - If I were to get the Infiniti G, it would be the coupe (I had a G35 coupe a few years ago and love it). Therefore, I won't be getting a ELLPS. I find the G sedan to be absolutely ugly, plus the fact that it's so big. At least it's RWD.Mercedes C-class - I do like the way the C-class looks, but the C250, after configuring, costs as much as my IS350. I do believe that Mercedes finally decided they wanted a piece of the ELLPS pie, and seriously upped the ante with the C-class. The previous 2 generations of C-class were, IN MY OPINION, bad jokes gone wrong. BMW, at least, had the right formula with the 3-series.With these points, I decided to go with the IS350, and absolutely love it. Perhaps when the lease is up, I might step up to the new 2013 GS.  "
"shipo","December 2011"," Agreed on the Civic versus Golf thing. Three years ago I needed a new inexpensive commuter car and after test driving both cars (in addition to the Corolla, the Focus, and the Mazda3) I had settled on a Golf (called a Rabbit back then); the Civic simply wasn't in the same league. Unfortunately due to the Mark V to Mark VI model change-over, all of the Rabbits with manual transmissions had pretty much been sold and the only cars left were automatics; I ended up with a Mazda3 instead.Fast forward to this year, my wife was looking for a new car, and while we didn't drive a Golf per-se, we did drive a GTI, and once again I was impressed with the vault like feeling of the car; after thirteen and a half years of driving exclusively minivans, my wife now has a new 2-Door black GTI 6-Speed sitting in her garage bay. Can't wipe the silly grin off of her face.  "
"sweendogy","December 2011"," Love the way the IS 350 looks- but again it's auto only,has been around for a bunch of years and has had minimal updates.

"nyccarguy","December 2011"," So my driving a TSX V6 (no tech pkg) loaner car has got me thinking about our board's Acura debate, argument, disagreement, thing. The TSX V6 has got some guts to it. I don't think it gives up that much fuel economy compared to my 4cyl. I do feel the extra 200 pounds in the nose though.Acura's lineup right now has too much overlapping. There is a mere $885 difference between the TSX V6 w/ Tech Pkg (a small percentage of TSX sales) & a TL w/ Tech Pkg (FWD). The difference between a TL (FWD, No Tech Pkg) & a TSX (4cyl) w/ Tech Pkg is $2695.Sween & Mark have both made some excellent points regarding the TSX, the TL, & the future of Acura.Here's what I have to say:Acura wants to be a sport/luxury division of Honda. The TSX is a good entry level starting point. Ditch the 4cyl & make the TSX V6 the base model. Acura constantly offers $4000 incentives on the V6 model anyway, so just make that the base engine. Offset the nose heaviness with Acura's SH AWD.Now this is easy for me to say. It does have some problems though. The TSX V6 w/ Tech Pkg weighs in at 3680 lbs. Add another 241 lbs for Acura's SH AWD system. You've got a grand total of 3921 lbs. That's a big pill to swallow for sween who thinks the base TSX is too heavy.The other problem about making SH AWD available on the TSX is its cost. $3550 per car is what Acura charges now on a TL.I really do LOVE Mark's idea of making SH AWD standard across the line. More on this later. "
"tlong","December 2011"," I just can't see going 6cyl on the entry car as making any sense. It destroys the handling and further bloats up an already bloated TSX relative to the original. And even BMW is going 4cyl. Just seems like a bigger bloated entry boat of a car isn't the way to go. "
"nyccarguy","December 2011"," Acura doesn't have a weight trimming budget like BMW does. You are also forgetting that the enthusiast community as a whole makes up such a small percentage of the car buying public.Did I notice the extra 200 lbs in the nose of my V6 TSX loaner? Yes. Would the average ELLPS buyer? No.Would the average ELLPS buyer notice the difference between the 2.4L 4cyl & the 3.5L V6 for the same price? Yes.Do buyers here in the northeast (a large luxury car market) consider AWD a luxury feature? Yes. Do they pay a price premium for it? Yes. Do they care that AWD adds weight? No. "
"nyccarguy","December 2011"," There's also a big difference between BMW's new blown 4 w/ an 8 speed auto and Acura's NA 4 cyl hooked up to a 5 speed automatic.Most BMW buyers won't know their new ""Bimmer"" has a 4 cyl engine unless the salesman tells them. "
"tlong","December 2011"," Do buyers here in the northeast (a large luxury car market) consider AWD a luxury feature? Yes. Do they pay a price premium for it? Yes. Do they care that AWD adds weight? No.I understand the needs for AWD in certain climates.Acura was successful for a long time with the Integra and Legend. Then it was the TSX and TL. And now it is the fat TSX and fat TL and useless RL. The fuel economy regulations are getting tougher and tougher. BMW is going 4 cyl in the US on smaller cars. BMW and Infiniti sell a LOT of cars based upon sporty handling, which is something that Acura has lost much of in the TSX. Adding a fuel hogging 6 cyl, then throwing 200 lbs. of AWD for the *entire market* seems like the wrong direction to me for an ELLPS.Acura must decide what it wants to be.A luxury Subaru? - then perhaps your suggestion makes sense.A cheaper Lexus? - keep numbing them up and improve dealer service even more.A bargain BMW? - Sorry, they were more in that camp before the latest refreshes.

"nyccarguy","December 2011"," Market the AWD for winter needs in the snowy climates & as a performance advantage in the areas where the weather is nice.TSX 4cyl Automatic - 22 city / 31 highwayTSX 6cyl Automatic - 18 city / 28 highwayDriving my 4cyl & the dealer's 6cyl back to back gave me a good perspective on the strengths & weaknesses of each.Steering - One thing I truly dislike about my 2010 TSX 4 cyl is the lifeless electric power steering. It transmits no road feel at low speeds and artificially firms up at higher speeds.The 6 cyl is equipped with hydraulic power steering. While a little over boosted for my tastes, it is progressively linear and very smooth. I totally prefer this setup to the electric unit in my 4 cyl.The V6 has an obvious edge in the acceleration department. Jump on the accelerator and it keeps going. I was traveling at triple digit speeds this AM berore I backed off and returned to a much more sedate 70. Passing is never a problem. My 4 cyl's acceleration is adequate. It never feels strained. I also know how to use the engine's high RPM power band. Merging onto the highway and cruising at 80 - 90 mph aren't a problem. I have to admit that getting back into my car tonight I was disappointed after driving it's V6 cousin for a day.Both cars ride nicely without feeling isolated. The handling edge goes to my 4 cyl TSX hands down. While far from a dedicated RWD chassis, the TSX makes the most of its Accord platform roots. There is a lightness to it. You can feel the weight transfer going around curves.The V6 is 200 lbs heavier & you feel the boat anchor during spirited driving. The VSA (skid control) is constantly fighting with this giant weight over the front wheels.The TSX is definitely (IMO) a luxury, performance oriented vehicle. Having driven both the E90 BMW 3 series (in both 328 & 335 flavors) as well as the Infiniti G37X, I think there's NO argument from anybody they are the true driver's cars of the group.I've read up and am impressed by the new Mercedes-Benz C-class reviews, but will reserve judgement until I actually get behind the wheel of one.I think even though it is FWD, the TSX stacks up against an Audi A4 2.0T (not the $50,000 prestige with Audi's Sport Differential).I've told you guys before, I originally bought the TSX for my wife using a cash for clunkers credit. I inherited it from her when we decided to buy a Pilot in anticipation of our 3rd child (Whitney is 3 weeks old today). Would I have bought it for myself if I went out car shopping for my daily driver that didn't have fuel economy restrictions? It wouldn't have been my 1st choice, I'll readily admit.Driving Dynamic wise, I'd pick the E90 3 then the G37XS sedan, & a distant 3rd would be the TSX.I'm happy with my TSX. "

"markcincinnati","December 2011"," I agree that a large majority of folks probably don't know if their 2WD cars are front or rear drive. I believe that folks who buy AWD are aware that all four wheels are driven -- they may or may not know if the bias is F or R, however.With virtually every Audi and BMW now or soon to be NOT naturally aspirated and likely 2 cylinders less than previously, I suspect many folks won't know if their A4 or 3 series or A6 or 5 series is a 6 or an 8 (respectively.)The fuel costs are probably more noticed than the # of cylinders.It may not be accurate for the whole country, but the Audi, BMW, Infiniti, Mercedes and Volvo dealers (and the sales of CTS Cadillacs) sales are -- well over 50% AWD these days (speaking as one from SW Ohio.) The Infinity dealer, in fact, sells some 90% of the EX, FX and M class vehicles as AWD (I suspect the same is true of the G's, I have simply not bothered to check on them).AWD for the non-purist, non-high-performance buyer is the performance option. And, of course, the two local Audi dealers basically ONLY sell quattros, to those in the know and those who don't care, period.We long-time Audi mavens also believe that quattro is THE performance set-up, wet or dry. Locally, I can't recall the last time I saw more than a few RWD Bimmer's either (but remember we are talking about SW Ohio where we ""sometimes"" have a snow fall that lingers more than 24 hours.)I have taken (four times) the Audi driving experience in Seefeld, Austria and (once) the BMW X-Drive school (here in the US -- in South Carolina), and although the ""purists"" who attend do proclaim RWD is the best, even they admit that BMW's are not very much fun on anything other than dry pavement, hence their purchase of an X-drive BMW and their attendance at the BMW X-Drive school.Overall, even the driving instructors (in both schools) are converts to AWD and Torque vectoring rear diffs, since we all drive our cars on both normal and low coefficient of friction surfaces often in the same day. In the ideal world, so many speak of, ""RWD rules,"" but perhaps since it ""never rains in Southern California"" RWD cars are seen as handfuls for the proletariat (those not living in SoCal.) In terms of preferences then, it seems that a lot of (the majority) folks -- if given the choice (and care) will opt for AWD, FWD and RWD in that order.Of course, to be crystal clear, I am speaking from the point of reference of those who care to comment who live in SW Ohio, SE Indiana and Northern Kentucky.Drive it like you live.

"sweendogy","December 2011"," While I love the BMW with the m sport package - in 328 form and being an automatic it won't run with the Lexus on a straight - infact the lex would prob leave the 28 in a pool of dust to 40 mph. 335 another story - plus throw in a manual and the M and you have a car that is the standard for the class. Now the new 328 which is not out yet could be a better comp. 328 a nice ride but it's a dime a dozen with auto - just look next time your at a mall parking Lot. Lease rates for these cars are also great, remember. "
"sweendogy","December 2011"," Tsx has more problems the it's power supply - infact the standard 4 is a fine engine - it's weight and no advancing on power from that said engine. Car has blown up like rosanne bar at a free buffet- let us not forget the styling it's taken on from the ugly tl. This car, which looks to be gone soon, should shrink, which Acura looks to be doing. You can talk about adding the v6 as standard and how well it drives but the fact of the matter is Acura cannot afford to sell these v6 tsx - they are offering 4k off for a reason, no one wants them. Also why they have them as lowner cars. Sh-awd, stupid name and acronym and all is great but acura wants costs low so they get buyers invthebdoor - if the tsx becomes a 35k car no one will even look at Acura for cheap lux. Hyundai has a turbo 4 that puts Hondas turbo I shame- this company without Honda would be close to being sabb - it's bad very bad. Look at the sales numbers and the patterns- how could they introduce a new TL and it sell less cars then the year before. Honda is putting out a new cr-v this year and mark my words they will sell a boatload more of them then last year- and it was the top seller in that group- its a shame Honda does not care about this brand.

"billyperksii","December 2011"," Sween-First, you own a G35 and I never seen you post any news or updates about Infiniti- always pounding about Acura this Acura that. Next you keep emphasing about Acura's sales and their survival. I never once seen or heard of any Acura dealership in trouble or on the brink of Bankruptcy. Infiniti should kiss the ring on Ghosen finger because they nearly went out of business several years back.Secondly, ALL car manufacturers offer incentives to move their inventory-the best of the best- Audi, Mecerdes, BWM. So scrap that thought process.Third, I see tons of A4, E350, 3series and ML as loaner vechicles, so again your point with the about the TSX been offered as loaner just does not mean anything.Can you let us know what is the latest news on the Infiniti products, try to sway some of us Acura loyalist over to the Dark Side. "
"markcincinnati","December 2011"," In my garage are two cars, one Acura and one Infiniti. For over twenty years that would have read two Audis; then for six years that read one Audi and one BMW. My wife and I have had twenty-nine Audis, three BMW's and two VW's.Prying German cars out of our hands was a major accomplishment for the two Japanese mfgrs noted above in the first sentence.The latest news on Infiniti products pertains to the new JX crossover. But if you are an enthusiast this vehicle will hardly light your candle. FWD bias, CVT transmission and a sub-300 hp 3.5L V6. Although the vehicle impresses visually (and yes I'll grant that is subjective) and has gobs of passenger room, it strikes me as Infiniti's Acadia. Yawn.I have been searching for an update to the ""aging"" (my words) G line, but have found nothing that even smells like a future product direction. I would hope, however, that the G grows in width to, say, A4 dimensions. It strikes me as a bit odd that the TL from Acura has a shorter wheelbase than either the A4 or the G37, but only the G feels cramped inside. If I can sit in the driver's seat and reach across to the passenger's window, I feel the vehicle is too narrow (for its length) in the ELLPS class. The A4 has grown in wheelbase, length and width (with a slight increase in legroom), as has the upcoming BMW 3 -- and the TL is damn near 5 series or A6 size. The G, for me, makes me feel like a bug.When I get behind the wheel of a G, I feel like I did the first time I got into a Ford Econoline van, I mean I feel like I am sitting on the front bumper.Now, the Infiniti in my garage is a 2011 FX35 Premium in black gloss with a java interior. I feel like I am piloting the hulk when I drive it. It feels big, powerful, broad shouldered and nimble all at the same time. I also got that feeling from my many test drives of an M37X. I would have had an M were it not for the requirement to buy a $3,000 option package just to get blind spot warning.I would suspect little will change for a few more years in the M's, since they are only 2 MY old. The corporate grill that has been added to the FX's makes me believe that the FX line will be refreshed perhaps in '13 or '14 MY. And, I assume the G's are due for a refresh in less than or equal to 24 months.Driving Audis, BMWs and Infinitis, I can tell you that the phrase Japanese BMW is an appropriate descriptive term for Infiniti. Infiniti seems to be striving for that certain something that makes a BMW stand out. Acura, based on my limited experience with the brand, on the other hand, seems to be -- sort of, kind of, er, a little bit like -- the Japanese Audi (from a few years ago) in that they don't hide their Honda-ness any better than Audi used to hide its VW parentage. If Acura were to ditch the Honda ""tells"" ASAP and make the Acura brand ""stand alone"" (as Audi has done from VW), they would be making great strides in establishing some kind of unique brand identity (which is largely lacking, currently.)Of course, it also wouldn't hurt one little bit if Acura would hire a designer or three away from one of the companies that make real purty 'sheens.Hardly the ""latest news"" since it is difficult to get news out of Infiniti from any reliable source, but, that's it!Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, etc.Drive it like you live. :shades: "
"nyccarguy","December 2011"," Styling is a matter of opinion. I happen to LOVE the styling of the E60 5 series which so many detest.

"flightnurse","December 2011"," The turbo 4 in the RDX is a high pressure turbo, this is one reason why it doesn't get good mileage. I'm saying the engine should be a low pressure turbo engine, direct injection. This would give more power, more torque and better MPG. This would transform the TSX into a more lively car to drive.

I am, however, certain, I will either make a statement or correct another's and be challenged (for instance on my ""bias"" for RWD biased AWD that employs torque vectoring, and, if possible, a TorSen differential.)

"markcincinnati","December 2011"," After 11 months with an Infiniti product, I have become a believer that they are producing cars that do warrant consideration especially if your other choice is a BMW. Of course, this Great Recession may be partially the cause of my ""conversion."" Despite the fact that I find the G too small (narrow), I believe it to be a bargain when compared to a 3 series. Max one of the G37X's out and it is, perhaps, $45K. Content the 3 as close as possible to the G and the price will be a lot higher.BMW's are breathtakingly expensive to repair (and sometimes even maintain) after the 50,000 mile BMW bubble expires. The Infiniti we own -- FX35 -- seems to be pretty inexpensive to maintain, and the 7 speed transmission has been trouble free (and we are now at about 18K miles).Everyone here is certainly entitled to not find anything attractive about a given brand or model within the brand -- and that is fine. However, if you have not recently taken an Infiniti (or any other car listed here on the masthead) out for a long test-drive, it seems unlikely that you can make a factual statement about the brand or specific model.I know, for instance, that I have not driven a Lexus -- my opinion is that they are sofa's on wheels -- but that is only based on car magazine comments that I have read. I probably have my head up my nose in thinking that they are not ""performance"" cars. I plan to not opine any further on the brand since I know very little about them.I really don't care if anyone test drives an Infiniti or an Acura -- I do care, somewhat, if a specific model is criticized but never driven. I participate in these boards to learn and to share experiences and opinions.I do enjoy being regaled by owners' (or even car mavens who have tested so many cars it almost seems a career) stories about their experiences.Keep 'em coming!

I took an ES350 on two extended test drives. There obviously is a market for them as there are quite a few on the road. They are nice cars, beautifully crafted, reliabile and a ton of tech.I, however, wanted more toward sporty aspirations. TL was too big, turning radius too big, not convinced of the value of SHAWD. G37 has neck snapping acceleration and fit me like a glove. I didn't even want to look at the TL 2012.As you aptly put it, outfit a 335 like a G37 and you are at $50 large.To each their own, everybody has their own priorities of what they want and/or dislike in a vehicle.

"nyccarguy","December 2011"," OK guys, we've been doing a lot of bickering disagreeing on the board lately. Let's try something different. If you've got any kind of driving experience (whether via test drive or ownership) with one of the ELLPS cars share with the group. I'll go first. Go to the bathroom & set your DVR, this is going to be a decent sized post.Acura TSX: As you all know, I own a 2010 Acura TSX with Technology Package. It's the 2.4 L 4 cylinder mated to a 5 - Speed Automatic transmission. I originally bought the car for my wife when we had 2 kids and were 2 years into leasing a 2007 BMW X3. After 2 years we already had 38,000 miles on it (and were only alloted 45,000 for 3 years). On the last day of cash for clunkers I bought the TSX using a $3500 credit.I think the TSX is handsome. Not head turning gorgeous like a 911 Turbo or 458 Italia. I definitely don't think it's ugly.I like the engine/transmission combination. The engine winds all the way up to 7000 RPM very smoothly. Transmission shifts are crisp. The transmission will hold a gear and not upshift at the redline. I love the thickly bolstered seats & the well crafted interior. It rides fantastic. Comfortable, yet far from isolated. Handling for a FWD car is very good.My main gripes with the car are it's lifeless electric power steering and it's crummy, straight from an Accord brakes.Infiniti G37X: My Uncle had one and he let me drive it. I took it on a really nice, 45 minute drive. I came away extremely impressed with this car. kdshapiro hit the nail right on the head when he said: G37 has neck snapping acceleration and fit me like a glove. This car's 326 horsepower make it a bona fide road rocket. Handling is truly amazing. Excellent balance. I got in the car and found pefect seating right away. After 5 minutes, it felt like it was MINE. The car feels like it is turning on an axis. If it had gotten an EPA estimated 2 mpg more, I'd have one sitting in my drivewy right now. It didn't qualify for the $3500 C4C rebate though.Lexus IS 350: I drove one at a Lexus event when this body style came out in 2006. I happen to like the car's styling. The interior was well crafted and well thought out. Acceleration was blazingly quick. I thought the suspension was too isolated, the brakes were instant on and had no pedal feel to them at all. The back seat was tiny too (this coming from a guy who drives a Prelude).BMW E90 3 series: I have extensively driven an E90 328xiA & E90 335xiA. The 328xiA was my Mom's car that she leased for 3 years. Even the heaviest E90 sedan (AWD & Automatic) with the 240 hp NA I6 is a blast to drive. Handling was unbelieveable. The engine is so smooth. Brakes are fantastic. Very progressive and linear. I'm madly in love with this car. It is everything people rave about and more.I had a 335xiA as a loaner a few times. It's torque is seductive. Pulls like a small V8 rather than a turbo 6. Amazing car.My biggest gripes with the 3 series is its cramped back seat, small trunk, and hefty price. I know it is a BMW and you get what you pay for. flightnurse, you happened to find a ""perfect"" driver's car sitting on a lot and got a helluva deal on it. My Mom's was an '08 328xiA with premium, cold weather, automatic, metallic paint, parking sensors, & manual sunshades (no sport, nav, or comfort access). It stickered for over $46,000. It is very easy for a 335 to get in the $50K range.Questions? Comments? "
"billyperksii","December 2011"," Mark, I dont just blabber about a car and read some article in a magazine. I actually test drove the G35X for an extensive time. The salesperson actually gave me the keys and said have fun but be careful.I wanted to try another brand because my previous car was the 2003 TL Type S, the G just did not do it for me, I tried to force myself to like it but I just knew it would have been buyers remorse.Here are the deal breakers and I have said this many a times-1).Too cramp (mazda millennia interior size)2). Intrusive growl (could get annoying a long road trips)3).

"
"sweendogy","December 2011"," Finally some substance. I agree the G could be a little cramped when compared to a TL or Buick- infact there have been complaints from bigger drivers that the cars seats are a problem. The growl is something that older folks have also complained about- the coupe does have a very intense growl when pushed in the city. The 07 and 08s sedans for sure also make sounds - this is something that can be heard when screeching from red light to red light bit not at 70mph on the highway- the newer g37 sedan has toned down the rear sound to make it more of a cruiser and to accommodate the older folks who complained. As I type Im getting ready for an 800 mile was coast tour which I'm dreading because we are not taking my g- we have to take my wifes cr-v because its roomier- the g is not a problem at all on long trips, I mean it's not a 89 covrvette - its a great highway cruiser when asked.Styling is subjective so can't argue.

"nyccarguy","December 2011"," The original IS300 was a great 1st entry into this segment. Razor sharp handling & excellent brakes. It's 215 horsepower I6 was outgunned by the BMW E46 328i (and then by the 330i) and it got not so great fuel economy (and this is when gas was cheap). Lexus owners complained about the ""rough ride."". Lexus brought the car in to compete with BMW's E36, but the E46 was already on its way by the time the IS300 hit our shores. They brought brass knuckles to a gun fight.They brought the 300 hp IS 350 (automatic only). Toyota Corporate V6. 0-60 in the mid 5s instead of the low 7s. Brakes that provided excellent stopping distance, but with not much pedal feel. Lexus was very high on their 300 hp number vs. 255 in BMW's recently released E90 330i.I drove the Lexus IS350 back to back with a 330i at their event. The Lexus out accelerated the BMW, but just felt very artificial compared to the very athletic BMW.The IS250 had no power. The problem with the IS350 was that only a year after its release was sent packing by BMW's N54 twin turbo 300 hp I6. I think Lexus is waiting to see the next 3 series to finalize the next IS.

"tlong","December 2011"," I wanted to try another brand because my previous car was the 2003 TL Type S, the G just did not do it for me, I tried to force myself to like it but I just knew it would have been buyers remorse. When I was looking for a new 2005 ELLPS, I looked at the G35 along with the TL. The G35 was noticeably a bit narrow, but not a show stopper for me. I actually like a bit smaller cars. I thought the TL's interior was nicer. I drove the G35 and noticed the major power, along with a major growl. I didn't like the lack of refinement. The TL was smooth and quiet. I then drove the G35 on a transition ramp between two freeways that you can take at about 55mph. There is a perpendicular concrete seam with a bit of elevation difference on this ramp, so going over it, the car jolts a bit and it is on a fast curve. On the TL, the car was steady over the bump. On the G35, the steering wheel jerked pretty hard and I really had to be holding it tight or it would have jerked out of my hand. Not so on the TL. Based upon that experience, the TL won. I just turned 115K on my TL today, and I've only had to replace a window actuator along with normal maintenance and an outside air temp gauge recall. No other mechanical issues. "

"savetheland","December 2011"," All mainstream cars are pretty boring so I looked at premium sector. I can hardly call it luxury cars since any sub-prime mortgage holder can afford one, so if you are rich consider something different.BMW 3-series - the best engineer car in segment. Comfortable, crisp, precise, good steering ans so on. As some say - fits as a glove. The only problem I had with it - unnaturally heavy steering at parking lot speeds, compact size and small trunk. It is a personal performance sedan, not luxurious but worth every penny. It is more expensive than other cars because of engineering effort went into its design.CTS - pretty refined except of engine. Steering is the most balanced in the group, good handling and unlike Infinity - comfortable and is not cramped. Next choice it you do not want BMW.Infinity G-series - I felt like I do not belong to interior - difficult to find comfortable position. Good handling, good transmission and engine and steering is very good also but ride is too harsh. I felt like beaten up after test drive. If you are going to commute every day - it is not for you - you will get tired soon. Unlike BMW it achieved good handling not because of superior engineering but because of making it harsh. It might be more reliable though than both CTS and BMW.Buick Regal - steering is very light - like in Acura - but unlike Acura it is precise. Engine is week and interior is high quality but not luxurious. May be not as reliable as Acura though. But it is certainly better handler and has considerably better steering. Reliability might be a concern - it after all is a German car made by GM.TSX - steering is numb, numb, numb. I felt scary because lack of any feedback from steering wheel. Engine is certainly better than in Buick. Ride is comfortable but does not feel as solid as in Buick. Might be reliable though but keep it mind troublesome transmission - Honda is famous for engines but have problematic transmissions.MKZ - it is a Fusion. It feels like Fusion, looks like Fusion and has too many cheap bits in interior like Fusion. I did not insist in seriously testing it. I will wait to see new 2012 to make final judgement.Audi A4 - it is superior to both TSX and Regal and I suspect new Fusion/MKZ too. Has to buy AWD version to really enjoy it. But reliability over years proved to be disastrous. As with all VWs I know that after warranty expires there will be a lot of very expensive repairs. No matter how I like it and I always liked it very much - it is not practical car for working people who have to make living by commuting to work every day. It may work if you lease until warranty expires. I wish I was a rich dude, but I am not - my money are hard earned. BTW I would prefer Audi to BMW. "
"kdshapiro","December 2011"," Disagree on the g. While its not Lexus vault like, it's a very good commuter car. I drive less than stellar roads and feel perfectly comfortable in it. I do agree it drives like the tires are nailed to the road. "
"carnaught","December 2011"," I agree with your opinion and assessment of the Infiniti as a commuter car. Although reliable, it (G37 Coupe) was uncomfortable for me, and its boy-racer sounding engine and hard ride were tiring on a daily high mileage basis. (No offense to Infiniti enthusiats.) "
"sweendogy","December 2011"," Again the new 4 door g37 (non-sport) has been tamed a bit due to old folks making comment on its engine noise. At highway speeds under no duress it's as quiet as my moms accord. The 2 door I cannot speak of. This class is both Lux and performance- if you are looking for an entry level lux car that is quiet go with the Es350 or Acura Tl. Cars that are well built but for the most part won't excite you on the onramps. "
"kdshapiro","December 2011"," No offense taken. Different strokes for different folks. "
"savetheland","December 2011"," Accord is actually quite noisy. Better idea is to compare it with Cadillac and BMW - direct competition. I found G to be not as civilized as CTS or BMW. It is more in muscle car category. I forgot to mention Mercedes and Lexus, but those are off my list. I drove Mercedes E-class before and felt it to be too quiet and refined - not for me. I suspect Lexus is similar. Both Mercedes and Lexus are probably for very old folks (even though I am not a young dude). I mean they are what Lincoln and Caddie used to be. Most likely along with Toyota they will take replace of Lincoln, Buick and Cadillac as preferred transportation for retirees. "
"sweendogy","December 2011"," The e class should be more refined - its a level up. I think you are on o something with the g - it does sound like it has more grunt because it does then the others in the conversation. The cts is a nice rig when given the big engine, lets not forget the V class, the 335 is the standard for sure- but throwing dollars in the conversation the muscle car can go toe to toe- dispite the louder notice going from standstill to 60 in under 5.5. Think about all the ear plugs you can buy for 10k, or better yet just turn up the Bose- the black keys sound terrific during those on ramp bursts "
"savetheland","December 2011"," C-class and Lexus IS are too compact for me to consider. And besides IS like Corolla and VW Beetle is driven mostly by ladies. I mean I would ignore car-for-ladies factor it if I liked it but I do not. Therefore E class and Lexus ES. But I cannot force myself to seriously consider ES and E-class is out of price range anyway. IMO Infinity G is for young people. When I was younger I cared about performance more than about comfort. But still premium car at least must be comfortable. "
"sweendogy","December 2011"," This class is not premium- its entry level - now if the criteria is lux, performance and price - hard to argue G vs any car here. Some are quieter, one is a better performer and few have the piece advantage "

"sweendogy","December 2011"," Thats fine I prefer performance and 10k (if looking at a 2011 335 comparison) . Btw good luck getting a 5 series or e class for 40k- again the title of the blog is entry level. - I would prefer an Austin Martin coupe as well if this wasnt entry level performance sedans forum.. I would also prefer a g6 plane for trips to maimi over jet blue middle seat. "
"carnaught","December 2011"," My point was that I've had them and do like them (Infiniti and Acuras), but I prefer German over Japanese for overall driving experience. (Sween, I agree with the obvious tone of your post that I've expressed more expensive rides than ELPS  .) "
"sweendogy","December 2011"," I also have caviar tastes but McDonald's bankroll (or as someone mentioned sub-prime holder status).

"carnaught","December 2011"," I hear you on this economy. It has taken some of the wind out of my sail for my car enthusiasm. I would compare a 535 to a G37 only to say that the latter has more bang for the buck. "

"markcincinnati","December 2011"," My experience exactly -- so far, nothing beats the German car driving experience within the $40K - $55K price range. And, come to think of it my one and only Audi A8 (which was north of $55K by a five figure number) would be my preference over any Lexus, too.My friend's 5 series came off lease. He looked at a new BMW (5 series, I presume); he seems to have the money to get what he wants (within reason), he got a new Genesis sedan (which I have sat in but not driven). I am not sure if he will get another Genesis next time, but so far he thinks it was a great value and at least a very good (if not great) car.Although the exterior look is somewhat derivative, the interior is a great interpretation of lux from any country. The transmission has 8 cogs and he claims tons of power.I think he said the lease turned out to be $299 per month (wow!)Anyway MY point is to agree that, so far, the Germans make the best car if driving is of interest to you. "
"flightnurse","December 2011"," Interesting that you talk about the Genesis, I travel for work a lot, and the only company I rent from is National, I have Emerald Club Executive Elite status with them, on my last rental with them in Indy I was able to get a Genesis, I was highly impressed with the car, it was quite, road well, very comfortable car, however the over all experience was just bland no personality to it at all, which is typical for an Asian car. I have seen the Genesis Spec R which would be a great car however the reviews continue to day, not sporty enough. Jan 3rd I'm back in Indy again and will try and get the Infiniti M37X. "
"sweendogy","December 2011"," I am also interested in this genesis r spec and would love to drive one at some pt- price and power very interesting - if only they could add awd. While I agree with you that Germans make the best driver cars your pot shot at the Asians didnot go unnoticed - drive a 6speed g37 tell me it's bland experiance. "
"markcincinnati","December 2011"," I have to assume that AWD is in the Genesis pipeline. I suspect they need another year or two to refine their ""house made"" 8-spd transmission. From what I read it is a notch lower in refinement to the ones used by Audi and BMW.BTW, is it true that Infiniti sources its 7-spd from Mercedes? And, is it true that the first year the 7-spd had some software problems but that they have since been corrected?Our late 2010 build 2011 FX35 AWD has the 7-spd and it has presented zero problems and zero recalls in 18,000+ miles. The only thing I do notice about the FX35's ""character"" is that the engine makes coarser sounds than the Acura 3.7L engine, but this trait is really only evident at very high RPM's and/or when the accelerator is floored. It should be improved by Infiniti, no doubt, as the Infiniti engine refinement is not quite up to Audi, BMW or even, Honda, er Acura smoooothness. "
"kdshapiro","December 2011"," To me it doesn't matter how the engine sounds at wot. The G37 will almost beat the 335 and is a rocket. For $45K if one stays away from the coupe models, you can get a fully loaded vehicle for a family of two is big enough for most occasions. (The occasions it's not big enough, neither is the Audi or Acura either)A 335 will cost $50K+ for the same equipment level. Having said that I don't think I would necessarily buy a fully loaded 335, but there are those who compare feature to feature. "
"ivan_99","December 2011"," To me it doesn't matter how the engine sounds at wotWhy not? "
"sweendogy","December 2011"," The problem I have with this conversation is the fact that under no duress the engine is as quiet as any on the board.

"fedlawman","December 2011"," I'm not trying anything. The G is a nice car, but I'm pointing out that depending on one's priorities, it's not the bargain some might think it is. Sure, you can add these features to the G, but then all of a sudden, the G costs $40,000.The C350 is a very nice $40,000 car... "
"carnaught","December 2011"," ""Some prefer fast and loud, others (like me) prefer not-as-fast and quieter, more refined. As was said, different strokes... ""Careful --- you'll be called an old man! I've been called worse  . "
"sweendogy","December 2011"," And if you add all those features to others in this category they all hover over 40k. Except tHe g comes with that noisey engine that turns 328 hp when others max out at 305. Your examples of what it does not come with are pretty much what others don't come with so your point about the price advantage in null. Price out that nice c350 and see how much it comes out to with leather, a sunroof and 18inxhers. 40k really? "
"fedlawman","December 2011"," Some of those features do come standard on the other cars, so it is a valid point. C350 w/leather, moonroof, and sport suspension w/18"" wheels = $44,240G37 w/leather, moonroof, and sport suspension w/18"" wheels = $43,245(I actually prefer leatherette and 17"" wheels, so my C350 would cost $41,450)It's not the volume of the noise that's offensive, it's the quality of the noise that matters. If the G37 sounded like a turbine powered sewing-machine at WOT, nobody would mention it.And your power argument only holds sway if you value being 0.2 or 0.3 secs faster than the Volvo or Acura next to you at a stoplight (of course, if the road is wet, that's a different story, huh?). In the real world, on real roads, the difference in power is insignificant.Again, it's not my intention to bash the G37 - it's a great car. For the shopper who values bang for the buck and doesn't mind a little roughness around the edges, it's a terrific value in the segment. But for many buyers, regardless of features, the fact that the G37 doesn't do luxury as well as some of the other cars here is a deal breaker. And add a few options that many buyers expect in this segment, and the value fades. "
"fedlawman","December 2011"," I've been half seriously looking at cars again to replace my wife's Volvo, and I test drove a 2012 Passat on Thursday. Woah, what a nice car!It's not a sporty sedan so it doesn't qualify for this segment, but it's not bad. It feels nimble and corners pretty flat but the steering is numb. The VR6 has serious guts though, without significant torque steer. It's also got a beautiful, elegant, simple, airy cabin with a very high quality leatherette (!) interior and a well designed touch-screen infotainment system. The cockpit compares well with the best of this segment, and the back seat is huge with unbelievable legroom and a cavernous trunk.MSRP was $29,000 for the V6 with sunroof, and it comes with pretty much all the features anyone would want. I honestly would have a hard time justifying spending $10K more for one of the subjects of this thread. I'm not ready to buy yet, but I was sorely tempted to take it home. It's now haunting my thoughts... "
"sweendogy","December 2011"," Sounds like you found your next rig congrats. I also like the vw passat, after all it's car of the year . I would suggest you check out the turbo desil -Gets 700 miles per tank, but given your last posts the torque and potential sound coming from the engine might get you sideways. Does it come standard with 18's? "
"fedlawman","December 2011"," Unfortunately, 18"" wheels are standard. I would prefer the 17's, which are standard on the TDI. I've never driven a TDI, so I don't know if I would like it or not (the sound quality or power delivery).Our Volvo is an I-5 and it's not the most refined motor either. My wife is the primary driver and she thinks it's fine, but I don't love it. The VR6 would be a little ($3500) indulgence for the rare occasions that I would drive it.I also really prefer wood trim accents, but it's only offered on the top-level SEL. The SEL includes Navigation and real leather, which I don't want. Damn packages... "
"savetheland","December 2011"," Yeah, but Passat has absolutely boring looks. The reason we pay extra for premium cars because want have style, comfort and good qaulity materials in interior and most of them perform well too. All those mainstream cars style range from ugly to boring and interior from ugly to cheesy. Nobody mention Volvo S60 so far btw. I find it is cramped. "
"sweendogy","December 2011"," speaking of darn packages - i jsut did a little research and while your pricing on both the infiniti and mb c350 are correct you failed to mention a couple of things-- ONE you maxed out a G37- meaning it has all the options premium, nav, and sports package... but with the MB it was a bait and switch approach - remember they have 2 colors for free paint other colors cost 700bux...sure you added 1k in wheels(need those 18 inchers remember) for your MB-- but where are the nav packages- the leather?- 1200 bux if you want xenon lights, 2700 for the backup and nav, 650 for keyless start..get my drift- these are in the packages you added for the G--Your BuildMSRP $40,575Additional Costs $8,660 (this does not include a 700bux paint charge)Transportation Charge $875Total $50,110 Estimate Payment (no thanks)Pricing is powerful -but to prove your point you must be true enjoy the VDUB(stay out of the left lane) "
"fedlawman","December 2011"," I optioned both cars the way YOU listed in your post (#12838):""Price out that nice c350 and see how much it comes out to with leather, a sunroof and 18inxhers.""I then explained that I don't like leather seating or 18"" wheels and that the Mercedes I would personally order costs $41,450. So, how is it on me that Infiniti bundles key features within bloated and overpriced packages? They do it on purpose to FORCE the consumer to spend thousands extra on stuff they don't want. Do you think it's an accident that in order to get the Sport Package, you also have to order the Navigation Package? That's $4000 for a laundry list of stuff you probably don't need and wouldn't have ordered, but you have to swallow it if you want your G37 to handle and stop a little better. :confuse: So, if I were to buy a G37, I would have to pass on the Sport Package and simply get the Journey + Premium Package for $39,245. That's only $2000 less than the Mercedes. Every buyer has different priorities, so the numbers might be different for others, but for me, the value of the G37 (which is it's strongest asset) has been significantly diminished.So how did this happen? Mercedes offers the C350 with sport suspension and moonroof standard, and offers the leather and 18"" wheels a la carte. This serves the customer - if the customer doesn't want leather or 18"" wheels, they don't have to buy them. Yes, if you want metallic paint on a European car, you have to pay for it, but at least you don't have to order the Shiatsu Massage and Curb Feeler Packages to get it.And enough with the annoying ""left lane"" remark. In this era of 300 hp family cars and 400 hp pony cars, 328 hp is nothing to brag about. If you really spend that much time in the left lane, I hope you have the decency to check your rearview mirror often. :P "

"tlong","December 2011"," I also found this interesting post courtesy Google:""In almost every comparison test where there has been a G35 tested against the E46 3 series, it has lost. You stick to thinking that your mad horzepowerz yo! is where it's at. All I gotta say is, I regret not test driving a 328 before I got my G37. I test drove the 335, and that car was utterly amazing, but for an extra 12k more, I decided to stick with the Infiniti. I got my bike for my speed fix. And that is what I should have thought about when I was buying the car. I thought the 328 would be disappointing after the 335 and the G37, but I was wrong. I test drove one a year after I got my G37 and the car drives amazing. The engine feels a million times smoother than the VQ and the throttle is not as abrupt. The clutch is a million times better. It absorbs bumps and imperfections on the road better as well. Other than the obvious lack of horsepower, which any adult really would not miss nor exploit on regular roads, the BMW, in any range of the 3 series, is a dynamically better car.Every time a comparison is done, same complaints come up for the Infinitis....too much NVH from the engine, disconnected steering, non linear braking, poor clutch engagement...and what do they do every year? Up the horsepower....go figure. And they do aim it at a certain audience that buys into it that believes that horsepower matter more than anything else."" "

"dino001","December 2011","  MB and BMW are more expensive for comparable equipment. One could carefuly option those to get somewhat close to G or TL, as long as they can let go some of those luxuries. However, one of my biggest complaints is 3-seres and C-series having fold-down seat optional (except 328 wagon). There is really no excuse for that - 12K Kia and Hyundai have it standard - there is no excuse. It's all about hitting some arbitrary limit for advertising ""starting at..."" BS. I know, I have 328 - fortunately it's a wagon, so it has folding seats and sunroof standard, but sedan does not. What makes it worse, I see dealers actually ordering those without folding seats in large numbers. I can only imagine a brand new owner of 50K 335 trying to fold his/her seats and discovering the car doesn't have it. :sick: :lemon: On many other options, I'm more agnostic - there are merrits to both approaches (bundling and not bundling). I tend to want almost everything, but ""experimental"" stuff (like adaptive cruise control or variable speed steering), but bundling sports package with Nav is a little too much, even if I would order both anyway. To me it's OK to bundle related items in package, like all convenience, all tech, or all sports. But cross-bundling does sound a little like making a run on customer's wallet, even if some customers would take them both. For value-oriented people probably nothing beats Acura - you get everything except Nav/technology. I like it, but it does have its limits - front wheel drive base version is one and that ugly nose :lemon:. We still don't have it so bad here - you would have to see a price sheet on BMW in Europe - it's actually a book!!! Proverbial mirrors and steering wheel are optional. Of course, they also have three times as many engine versions, which creates many more permutations, but that's a different story entirely. Not to mention everything costs nearly twice as much (literally - $50K+ 335 would likely cost you almost 100 grand there). "
"fedlawman","January 2012"," FWIW, I don't have a personal stake or emotions tied to this discussion because I don't own any of the cars in this segment. Also, I can research (and maybe eventually purchase) a boring Passat or Subaru Outback for my wife without craving more excitement because I already own an honest sports car that gives me more driving and ownership pleasure than any car in this segment ever could.M-B C350 Standard features missing on the G37 Journey:*Sport suspension with electronic control adaptive dampers*Adaptive brakes with predictive brake priming, auto brake drying, and hill start assist*14 way power driver seat with power lumbar adjust*Power steering column*Driver memory with settings for seat, mirrors, and steering column*Auto dim rearview and driver outside mirror*Moonroof*Wood trim accents*Rain sensing automatic wipers*Split-fold rear seats*Harman Kardan Logic 7 450 Watt audio*9 airbags including pelvis and knee airbags*Attention Assist to detect driver drowsinessG37 Journey standard features missing on the C350:*Xenon headlamps*Leather seats*Keyless start*Free metallic paintPlease let me know if I've missed anything... So, my assertion that the G37 lacks quite a few features seems to be valid. But more importantly, did you notice that most of the C350 features are performance or safety related while the G37 features are basically fluff? But to even things up as accurately as possible, let's load them both up as closely as we can...So, a C350 with added Xenon headlamps, leather seats, Navigation, metallic paint, 18"" wheels, and Keyless Start costs $46,440.Now, a G37 Journey with wood trim, Premium Package, Navigation Package, and Sport Package costs $45,045.It looks like the Mercedes is $1400 more expensive than the G37. But the G37 still lacks electronic adaptive suspension, adaptive brakes, and attention assist. Also missing are headlights with adaptive highbeams, curve assist and headlamp washers, split-fold rear seats, knee and pelvis airbags, and rain-sensing wipers.The C350 lacks DVD playback, Zagat Restaurant Guide, aluminum pedals, magnesium shift paddles, and a Viscous Limited Slip.Draw your own conclusions - I'm exhausted... :sick: "
"fedlawman","January 2012"," I discovered an error in my research. I'm not sure what I did, but the above described C350 actually costs $48,190, not $46,440. (Edit: the $1750 leather seats didn't get added in)I also just noticed that when I added the wood trim to the G37, it automatically added the $1200 Technology Package, which includes rain-sensing wipers and pre-crash seatbelts. Since these are standard features on the C350, this doesn't change the math in my previous post.The increase in the price of the C350 raises the gap between the Merc and Infiniti up to about $3150.However, something else occurred to me... Take the well equipped C350 described above and remove the metallic paint ($720), 18"" wheels ($1040), and leather interior ($1750) - options which affect appearance only (barely, if at all) and have no effect on performance, comfort, safety, or functionality.The same C350 now costs $44,680 - a savings of $3500!Now do the same thing with the above described G37 and remove the wood trim...oh wait, the Technology Package requires the wood trim. OK, lets remove the 18"" wheels...nope, they're part of the Sport Package that includes the upgraded suspension. Leather seats are standard, so that's not an option. OK, I hate to lose it, but what about the moonroof? Sorry, it's part of the Premium Package which includes driver memory settings and Bose premium audio.The C350 now costs $350 less than the G37.

I've never really liked the E90, but this F30, with significantly more power (torque!) and less weight, has the potential to be a real game changer. I predict it will steal a lot of 335i sales and be THE sales and value leader in this segment. I also think it's much better looking than the E90. And following current industry trends, it should also be less expensive than the E90.

I do not (and really don't plan to) ""track"" my car (never have).So I go through German and now Japanese ""luxury performance sedans"" one after another -- ordering upsized wheels/tires, sport packages, sport seats, sport suspensions, whatever has sport in it. I used to fight the good fight and order cars specifically so that I could get manual shifters. I chipped my turbo cars, changed out the air filters and BPV's to squeeze out any additional power I could (from the turbo's of course).For what?A quick dash to 35MPH, before I had to abruptly mash the brake pedal or rear end the guy parked on the highway in front of me! That's what.I read the reviews of the new BMW 328 (with the turbo 4), and I really got excited (for about 9 minutes) when I saw the acceleration figures -- but then I thought, ""I probably can't even use that much power on the entrance ramp to I-71S"" (I'd rear end someone.)Nevertheless I continue to want more -- I want my cars to be ever quicker (they're already fast, even the puny ones can go 130MPH, which is where many of the Germans place the ""limiter"") even though it is hard to imagine regularly (or frequently) being able to enjoy the ever quickening acceleration from the Americans, Europeans and the Japanese.I want ever larger and sticky-er tires, firmly sprung and electronically controlled suspensions, the whole enchilada -- and for what, the one time I can carve that corner (without fear of hitting a deer in the headlights -- literally Bambi.)I have become irrational about the performance -- I want more more more, whereas traffic and circumstances of urbania and even sub-urbania allow less less less -- of the cars I drive. Perhaps that is why my fondest memory (and my all-time favorite car) is of a 1995 Audi S6. At least, way back then, I could actually slip the car into first gear and rapidly release the clutch and floor the accelerator without rear-ending the guy in front of me being my first and foremost thought.Now I am driving a car that is as fast as any on this board and faster than many. Moreover, the thing is capable of holding its own in quickness too. Good luck in being able to actually enjoy the performance.Yet, with 31 months to go on the lease, I am wondering -- what will be quicker, sticky-er and have more technology next time?Completely irrational.I'm thinkin' the evolution of the new BMW 3 (in the next 30 months) or the G from Infiniti (and possibly another Acura) or maybe back to my old love, Audi will provide more more more. By then, however, I'd imagine that an occasional sprint to 55 or 60 will seem ""freakin' awesome!""Drive it like you live (or rather, as you would like to live). :confuse: "
"fedlawman","January 2012"," Mark, great post (as usual). We're all in the same boat, but we're enthusiasts so we want the potential, even if we can't use it.We live for the occasional empty decreasing radius onramp (and we know where all of them are located within 12 miles of home), and we want to have the torque to squirt through a gap in traffic when we're stuck behind a LLC. Like owning a jetski or an airplane - we can't use it all the time, but when we do, it's a blast.But your reasoning is sound. That's why I would even entertain the option of owning a Passat or Subaru - ELLPS power and cockpit, but without the brand cache and chassis prowess that I can't use.BTW, my company car is a Chevy Malibu, so M-F, onramps and the occasional bare stretch of road don't have anything to offer me but temptation. When I'm on my commute and happen to see someone in a 993 or worse, an E30, it just makes me wish I was in my personal car...which I do drive to work occasionally just for the fun of it. "
"flightnurse","January 2012"," I believe we are the same age or close. I was very lucky to get a great job out of college.So far I have owned all but one of my dream cars, and I have started the hunt for it, a Acrua NSX.Willow Springs was my home track for both cars and motorcycles, having road raced many bikes at both Willow and Laguna Seca however Willow is home, both the streets and track. Yes I have attended a few HPDE's, last one was at Firebird (which BTW isn't my fave track) but its a blast to be able to get the 330 sideways without worrying about the local police. "
"fedlawman","January 2012"," Very cool Flightnurse. It's great that you have owned the cars you wanted to own (and bikes too!). I love the NSX - looks and performance still hold up. I see one on the road every now and then. Another car I love seeing but is pretty rare now is the 300ZX twin turbo. Not an NSX, but someone in my neighborhood has a cherry one and my heart skips a beat whenever I see it. I went through a bike phase (Honda Hurricane 600) when I was in the Army. Then when I lived in L.A., my friends and I used to ride Mulholland and go to the Rock Store. I was a pretty good rider at 8/10ths, but I never got good enough or brave enough to go faster. I got hit by a car in 1990, sold the bike for parts, and never rode again. "
"busiris","January 2012"," Sorry I was late to the party, but my special order experiences mirror those of NYC and Shipo.Often, it's actually cheaper for a dealer to sell the same car special order .vs. from stock, as the dealership has no $$$ directly tied up in the special order vehicle, as he may have in one on the floor.IMO, I have always done better negotiating for a special order than a floor model. Obviously, the dealer understands you are more educated about the potential vehicle, and that you are less willing to settle for something less than what you want.The big drawback, of course, is the waiting period, and the uncertainty of the trade in value at the time of actual delivery. "
"markcincinnati","January 2012"," Ordering a car is ""always"" less money than buying one in inventory.Why?#1 Dealer has a buyer and will not have any cost of borrowing or at most a very small cost of borrowing -- meaning the discount can be larger (""can be"" doesn't always mean ""will be,"" but hopefully you get the point.)#2 Many of the LPS and ELLPS cars are ""on allocation"" -- as it was explained to me, ""the more cars I sell, the more cars I can get."" So, your order will potentially increase the total number of cars the dealer will be able to get, especially if the brand is from Europe, more specifically Germany.Dealers love ordered cars -- I would bet, overall, that dealers would love to have only demo's in stock and have 50 or 60 cars on order every month. As far as I know, this is the way it is done in Germany (mostly). You research your car, you go to the dealer who has a demo -- if you like it you order it.No instant gratification, but the buyer gets EXACTLY what he/she wants, not ""close enough for jazz"" as we do in the US.I wanted a pearl white TL (check).I wanted it with the Umber leather (apparently not possible this year and not even possible as a custom order like the Germans allow -- for $2,500 over the normal cost).I accepted Pearl White with a Black Leather interior. I wanted the Advance package, too (check).Actually come to think of it, the inability to order a car the way you want it, is a strike against Acura.Oh hell . . . As Meat Loaf says, ""two out of three ain't bad.""Happy Freaking New Year! "
"nyccarguy","January 2012"," Excellent posts guys.How fast can we really go on our public roads? How much power do we really need? We're car enthusiasts & that's what we want.I live in Connecticut & Commute to The Bronx 6 days a week. The roads I drive on have mostly 50 mph (in NYC) & 55 mph (Westchester & CT). There's even a 3 lane (each way) parkway I take sometimes with a 45 mph speed limit! 2 of my cars (Prelude & TSX) have 200 horsepower 4 cylinder engines. Guess what? I seriously have trouble keeping the speedos under 80. If I slide my TSX shifter down a notch and use the paddle shifters, it hits 100 mph in 4th gear.I've got my Prelude Type SH as my super fun to drive, lightweight, exit/entrance ramp attacking, awesome handling, stick shift car that I drive to work once a week now.The TSX is my daily driver. As much as I love driving my Prelude, the thickly bolstered, heated leather seats, automatic climate control, & bluetooth, & even the (gasp) automatic transmission are fantastic. My wife does drive it on the weekends if she goes out for the afternoon on her own without the kids. She prefers driving the TSX solo as opposed to her 2011 Pilot which she chauffers the kids around in all week. It is nice to have 2 automatic transmission cars.I do admit to having an option ""prejudice"" when it comes to the different cars in this class. No way would I even consider a G25X, only a Sport/Nav/Premium G37X. With a BMW, the only way I could even think of affording a 335Xi is if it is a CPO car. Then I'd have to really think, is it really worth it to get this CPO 335xi over a brand new optioned as I want 328xi? With the upcoming 320i w/ X drive 328i 2.0L Turbo 4, the 260 lb ft of torque & sub 6 second 0-60 mph time will do it for me.When the time comes, I'd have to check out the C350 as well. Who knows, BMW may have botched the electric power steering (it is LIFELESS in my TSX)? Maybe MBs 7 speed auto transmission & 3.5 L V6 would be a better fit for my daily commute. I might be able to pick one up at a screaming bargain executive demo car too. MBUSA's headquarters (as well as BMWUSA's) are about 15 minutes from where my parents live & the dealership near them might pick up an MB Executive Demo car that's RWD instead of the run-of-the mill C300 4Matics that every dealership stocks. Maybe if I LOVE the Mercedes that much, I could live with a RWD car in CT. I'd be willing to live with MB Text instead of the full leather.There's been a lot of talk about the ""high end harshness"" of the G37's engine. Fact of the matter is, ask most people & they are very happpy with their G37 Sedan.It is really fantastic to have the perspective on here not only from the casual enthusiast, but also from guys who track their cars & have been to driving schools too. "
"dino001","January 2012"," It is funny, because the dealers would make you believe they're doing you such a favor by ordering a car the way you want it. Germans aren't so bad, but they always start their negotiations from ""if it's an order, it'll be at sticker"", like it was a rule or something. Even though, as you mentioned, an ordered car is lower cost to them, they want actually a larger profit on it. Classic reverse psychology: you came it, you want it just like it, you must be very motivated, so I'm charging you for that desire - if you walk away, no harm done to my bottom line, yet, as long as there are enough people to come and get something else. On the other hand, the one on my lot is sitting there, if you walk away, I'm still having a car to sell, so I better price it to sell now. It's all instant gratification. When I ordered my 328i SportsWagon for ED followed by Performance Center delivery (yes, you can combine the two), many people at work could not understand why I would wait for a car for four month, just to get it right. Isn't that easier to go there and just get a red one off the lot? They're asking. Well, yes, but to me a deal on something you don't really want is not a deal at all. "
"markcincinnati","January 2012"," I have been to three Audi (in Seefeld Austria) driving schools and one BMW driving school (here in the US in South Carolina). Both schools teach you how to brake, steer and generally gain a pretty high level of control over your car at speeds faster than you are probably able to imagine yourself going ""comfortably.""I drive my 305HP TL so slowly on Interstate 71S on the way to downtown Cincinnati, I rarely have any chance to exercise my abilities.We had our first slick road conditions here yesterday -- the local news interviewed our State Highway Patrolman du jour about how to drive defensively (which is, after all, what they teach in the Audi and BMW driving schools even if they never use that term). The first 25 seconds of the response from the highway patrol was to describe what to do if your vehicle is NOT equipped with ABS (or stability control) -- just as he started to explain the differences in braking with ABS vs non-ABS, the interview was cut short.As I watched this interview unfold, I grew angry since the response from the cop was to NOT press hard on the brakes without ABS and I knew he was about to say something like, ""unless you have ABS . . . (wherein he was cut off) in which case you should apply your brakes with maximum pressure on the brake pedal.""If anyone was about 75% paying attention, I would think they would press on their ABS equipped car's brake pedal until the tell-tale vibration started and then quickly reduce pressure on the pedal. Of course this is just the opposite of what should take place to ensure the shortest, straightest stop (with steering capability, to boot)!What is the % of ABS equipped cars? I've had it in all my cars since 2000 for pity's sake -- 11+ years.Why not talk about getting out and cranking the engine with the hand crank?Oh crap, I'm way off topic.Hmmm, let's see -- OK, I've got it.All ELLPS and LPS (and most other cars on the market today) have BOTH ABS and Electronic Stability Control, we should be taught how to use them for optimum effect!Whew, hopefully I saved it. Sorry for going off track. I panicked.Burma. :blush: "
"busiris","January 2012"," I live less than 10 miles from the BMW Performance Center and have been on their track many times.I agree with your comments about confusing the drivers about braking practices.Its one of the 1st things you're taught by the Performance Center trainers when you pick up your new BMW car there, and I would guess well over 75% start out the day not knowing the proper procedure for braking in wet/icy conditions.BTW, I never tire of spinning out on the skid-pad at the Performance Center track....

"rayainsw","January 2012"," Long post &#150; fair warning . . .I do recognize that even a quarter mile blast [ to well over 100 MPH from a standing start, in my current BMW 3 ] is something I am unlikely to do anytime soon &#150; or anywhere but a race track. However, I use [ and I appreciate ] the ability to gain speed when I want or need to. The deep well of Torque available at most any RPM, in any gear, allows acceleration with a degree of ease, an effortless surge that I find quite satisfying. Though I relish those occasions when I can apply WOT for more than a few seconds, I also appreciate the times where much less than full throttle accomplishes the task at hand [ passing, merging, etc. ] with no flash or drama. There is [ to me ] a strong feeling that this car [ in some ways like the Corvette I drove for over 2 years ] will do anything asked &#150; all day long &#150; and accomplish the assigned tasks without breaking a sweat.This applies to the handling, as well. Though I never purposely approach 10/10 in my [ street ] driving, the feeling of precision and my sense that there is capacity well beyond what I will intentionally use results in a level of security that I value. Within the performance envelope I use, this feeling that I am always well inside the car&#146;s limits is of value &#150; to me.So &#150; in addition to the quantifiable performance aspects [ acceleration rate, cornering Gs, etc. ], for me, that feeling or sense of capacity beyond what I can comfortably tap in my typical driving is one reason that I am willing to pay the price for something like the BMW 3.I use the aspects of the performance that I think I prudently can, when and where I can &#150; and this other &#145;sense - touchy, feely&#146; stuff sustains me from one such occasion to the next.

"flightnurse","January 2012"," Mark for me its not how fast I can drive my cars, but the pleasure it brings.

There are a couple of off amps and on ramps that really brings a smile to my face in Phoenix. "

"nyccarguy","January 2012"," I plan on waiting until my TSX is paid off and beyond anyway, but will definitely entertain the idea of a CPO F30 328i w/ XDrive when the time comes.I too love pretty much everything about the current E90 3, including all the little details you listed. It is just too small for my needs. With 3 young children, in addition to wonderful driving dynamics & rapid acceleration, I need a decent sized trunk & a spacious interior. A stroller would take up 90% of the trunk space in an E90. A child safety seat attached forward facing in the rear of the car literally touches the ceiling. A rear facing infant seat would render the front passenger seat useless.We had an '07 X3. It had tons of rear seat room for child safety seats (forward or rear facing) without impeding on the comfort of the front passenger. Reliability wise, the car was perfect. Only went to the dealer for scheduled service visits & 1 other time. With 42,000 miles (3,000 shy of lease allotment), my wife swerved to avoid some debris in the road and whacked a center median high curb. She took out 2 tires and a wheel. She also needed an alignment to go with it. The service advisor told me that the 2 remaining tires wouldn't pass BMW lease end inspection and that I should replace them. I also callled him at 11:30 am, arrived with the X3 on a flatbed by 12:45 pm, and there was a loaner warmed up & ready to roll for me.I should have bought the X3 at its lease end with it's brand new tires and stellar reliabiliy record. Plus I LOVED driving it. I had the TSX which was just a year old with 17,000 miles for it that I didn't want to get killed as far as depreciation goes, then take out a loan on a 3 year old BMW with 46,000 miles. I had just taken a bath selling my apartment and had bought a house so I figured keeping the Acura was a safe bet. Plus I wasn't thrilled with the X3's cargo room. The Acura actually has a longer & wider trunk.Like I've said before, I like the TSX. A lot. It just isn't a car I picked out to be my daily driver. I inherited it from my wife after we found out we were expecting our 3rd child and bought her a Pilot. When the time comes to replace the TSX, I'm most certainly going to replace it with a BMW. "

"nyccarguy","January 2012"," shipo: My Aunt & Uncle live in Southern, NH (Salem), very close to you. You also know I have a tremendous amount of respect for your opinion and vast knowledge, especially when it comes to all things automotive. You guys get some serious snow. Much more than we do here in Stamford, CT. I've lived in NY all my life (Rockland, Ithaca, Manhattan, Westchester) and much like MA & NH, they plow & salt. Early and often. I thought the weather here in Stamford would be exactly the same as in Southern Westchester (Hartsdale, White Plains) where I had moved from. I was very much mistaken. Now I will admit that we had a ""bad winter"" last year as far as snowfall goes. Here in Stamford, I live off The Merrit Parkway and many people have well water, so they DO NOT salt the roads. They also don't send the plows out like they do in NY. I've got to be at work at 7:30 AM. That means leaving at 6:30 on normal days and between 6:00 & 6:15 when it snows. Last year I saw a few times that they had done a few passes on The Merrit, but didn't plow the entrance/exit ramps. I actually followed a plow on the the parkway thinking I'd be able to get off at the next exit and turn around. Well, I had to drive 10 miles North to Norwalk before I could turn around and come back south. This was all in my 2001 Honda Prelude equipped with a set of Michelin Pilot Arctic Alpin winter tires. I think AWD with a set of 4 snow tires would have helped me plow through some of those unplowed on ramps and made my life easier.For years I thought AWD/4WD was not needed in the ""tri-state"" area. That RWD and a set of winter tires would be all my whatever bmw I was building online would need. AWD adds weight & cost. It hampers fuel economy & performance for the other 355 days a year that it doesn't snow. AWD helps you start, but the added weight can be your enemy trying to swerve around something and increased your stopping distance. After spending 1 (bad) winter here in Stamford (southwestern CT for those who are unfamiliar with the area), my tune has changed.I equip my FWD Acura TSX with 4 Michelin Pilot Arctic Alpin winter tires. My next car will hopefully be a BMW. I'd love an X1 (gas or diesel), a CPO X3 (N55 Turbo), or an F30 328i w/ X drive. "

I don't really want to get into a discussion about the merits of AWD vs RWD or FWD or the difference between 2 driven and 4 driven wheels -- however, therefore, notwithstanding (and any other lawyer-ly sounding thing), I do agree that AWD done poorly can hamper performance. I agree that typically (meaning virtually always in fact) the added weight of AWD does decrease fuel mileage.Yet we don't live (or at least most of us don't live) in a perfect world with respect to driving -- if we did, I suspect virtually everyone would agree that RWD at least ought to be the best.Assuming we all accept the premise that our driving world is imperfect, I would submit that AWD generally speaking (and with the qualifier that I am speaking about AWD done well, such as by Audi, BMW and Infiniti, wherein the AWD is rear biased and may include torque vectoring or what is sometimes called a sport differential) performs better in the real world.My premise is that AWD is not just about driving in the snow and on other low coefficient of friction surfaces.We can, if you like, agree to disagree and be done with it -- I just couldn't let the ""hampers performance"" remark stand since it seems too broad and perhaps would lead a newcomer to this forum to come to believe that only RWD is good and AWD sucks gas and decreases performance.

"nyccarguy","January 2012"," Ok all my friends out there who track their cars on a regular basis or have driven cars on a track. I understand the basic idea of why RWD rocks (especially on the track). The front wheels steer the car while the rear wheels drive the car. RWD is lighter and less complex. You can oversteer the car if you want to. How does the AWD car have such an advantage if it is heavier and has a tendency to understeer (although not as much as a FWD car)? I also know there are different types of AWD systems out there. BMW's X Drive is RWD based, Subaru's Symmetrical AWD (50/50 Split with a WRX Manual Transmission), Audi has 2 types of quattro (50/50 & the Rear Biased in their performance models). "
"kdshapiro","January 2012"," This is a conversation that can only go down the wrong path. Tracking/racing the car is one thing, street driving is another.The only reason I have AWD is I don't have to put on snows, and if I need snows, I'll put em on four wheels. The rest of the supposed benefits or disadvantages I don't really care about, because I'm not racing my daily driver. I'm trying to get back and forth to work safely. "
"nyccarguy","January 2012"," My question is specifically for tracking/racing, not street driving a daily driver.Not trying to start a RWD vs. AWD war. "
"qbrozen","January 2012"," Well, the tendency to understeer is of course relative to the car. Not all do. And for those that do, a rear swaybar upgrade can take care of that, as can, to some degree, a front/rear differential in tire pressures (higher pressure in the rear will add oversteer).The biggest advantage to AWD on the track, IMHO, is being able to get on the power much earlier and harder. Traction coming out of turns is critical, and, obviously, you get much more power down to the road with AWD.My personal experience was with my G35x compared to all other vehicles I've autocrossed. I did not have to be at all careful with the X. Just all gas or all brakes and nothing in between. With every vehicle since, I've had to train my right foot to wait and then modulate. "
"sweendogy","January 2012"," Big announcement is here- new rdx (based on the cr-v), the Ilx (civic based) which is a fwd smaller car, and finally the nsx which will be a awd hybrid. Looks like styling on the first 2 are inline with current offerings. "
"nyccarguy","January 2012"," So than for your average non-tracking driver who enjoys on/off ramps & twisty back roads, the only advantage of AWD is the extra traction provided by the 4 driven wheels on slick surfaces? "
"billyperksii","January 2012"," The NSX is a looker-right, but three years is a long wait.What's going on with the RL- doesnt look like Acura is shooting for 8, maybe they will mimick the NSK 6cycl hybrid. "
"sweendogy","January 2012"," Nsx does look pretty cool. I don't know anything about the RL as it wasn't mentioned in anything I read about the auto show or on the Acura website. The new entry level caddy looks promising - lighter then most packing a 300hp eng. "
"markcincinnati","January 2012"," No. "
"nyccarguy","January 2012"," Yeah, the new X5 M every 2 years is a drop in the bucket for him. His wife drives a '10 750 Li w/ X Drive. His 3rd garage is currently occupied by a Challenger SRT-8. I say currently because I think he's sold the Dodge & is one of the 1st on the list for a new M5. "
"nyccarguy","January 2012"," You are biting your tongue over there Mark. "
"alltorque","January 2012"," This is a huge topic and lots of variables so probably no simple, definitive, answer.As a simple soul I'd try, (and probably fail), to categorize as follows :Given that the driver is reasonably competent in all cases then RWD takes some beating on a good dry track and the car can be beautifully ""balanced"" into/out of corners. On the rough stuff - gravel, forest tracks, (e.g. typical WRC special stages), or very wet conditions/snow etc then AWD will have advantages simply by having drive at all four corners. Then we get into weight distribution and front engine, mid-engine, rear engine configurations. Early Porsches were pretty quick but, in the hands of the unwary the engine hanging out the back would generally try and overtake the front of the car without much warning. Of course, a world class driver in either a FWD or RWD car will outperform an idiot in an AWD car, (of similar performance).That's the simple version - probably.  "

"flightnurse","January 2012"," Check this URL out, hopefully it explains everything.http://www.autoworld.com/news/Audi/Quattro_system.htmIf AWD didn't have such an advantage then FIA wouldn't have banned AWD cars... "
"qbrozen","January 2012"," the only advantage of AWD is the extra traction provided by the 4 driven wheels on slick surfaces?Well, essentially, yes. If you drive with a gentle foot and the primary drive wheels never lose traction, then the AWD would never kick in on many vehicles (those that are 100/0 split under normal conditions, that is). "
"qbrozen","January 2012"," that's all about racing, though. His question now is whether, in nonracing nonadverse conditions, AWD has any advantages. I personally can't think of any. I mean, if you NEVER get into a situation where you need the added traction, then it is just extra baggage. "

"markcincinnati","January 2012"," As I suspected the HOST would intervene -- and rightfully so and put a screeching halt to the two driven wheels vs four driven wheels ""discussion.""There are many threads, here on edmunds and hundreds (or more) all over the 'net, that have beaten this topic damn near into submission. If you need additional information, the link provided above pertaining to quattro should be one of your first stops. Then let Google or Bing or Dogpile be your friend and search the web to your heart's content.So yes, I am biting my tongue because the real answer to your question about AWD being just for low coefficient of friction (i.e., slick) conditions isn't a direct ""yes"" or ""no"" -- like so many things in life the truth is ""it all depends.""Moreover, the RWD mavens and the AWD mavens for that matter will probably never agree even with tons of data -- because the data will undoubtedly be presented with qualifying statements. Then one of us here will latch on to a qualified statement and proclaim it as the universal truth.Of course Audi's piece (the link referenced above) is marketing material. Yet unless they have misrepresented the facts they cite, their statements should not be dismissed just because of ""your"" bias for 2 wheel drive (and that means RWD, virtually all of the time.)Ever wonder why the discussion seems to be AWD vs RWD and that there are many supporters of those two approaches who are ""gunning"" for a fight, er, ""discussion?""I have sometimes wondered: Why is it that there are none (or perhaps virtually none) willing to proclaim the best system is 2 driven wheels (and that those wheels should be the FRONT wheels)?We have folks almost willing to come to fisticuffs to defend and ""prove"" that RWD is most righteous; likewise AWD. Where are the FWD defenders?Me, I think all autos in the ELLPS and LPS classes should at least offer AWD and if they don't they shouldn't be in those classes, no matter how many technical do-dads can be ticked off on the option list.My cousin just got that fancy schmanzy 2012 KIA Optima SX with everything on it -- the thing even comes with heated REAR seats (like my $53K Audi A6) -- but, I would assume the FWD and the sub $30,000 price, etc, keep it out of the ELLPS and LPS classes.In any case, I have the 2WD vs 4WD thing out of MY system for a while at least -- and remember I said I did not want us to start down the path (the ""discussion"") that has been done and re-done and re-re-done so many times here at or in this very web site.I know I can't win but I'll just end wondering why if AWD is really only for slick surfaces, that the World Motor Sport Association forbade four-wheel drive in their events as an ""unfair advantage."" :surprise: "

"
"markcincinnati","January 2012"," I have lamented the lack of manual transmissions in these ELLPS and LPS cars for years -- my last manual was virtually the last manual that I could get in a car that I really wanted, and that was in a 2003 Audi allroad with the 2.7T engine.Then I bought a 2005 Audi A6 with the 6-speed tiptronic, followed by a 2009 A4 2.0T Prestige with the sport package (also with the 6-speed tip). We have an '11 Infiniti with the 7-speed auto trans and I have test driven several 2012's that have 8-speeds (all German cars, of course). Frankly, my experience with a modern well-done 6,7, or 8 speed auto pretty much means I don't care, too much, if I never again have to row my own. The current crop of automatics really is, THAT GOOD! :surprise: The point is (finally), the reason for the paucity of manual transmissions offered to us 'mericans is -- us. Even when manuals are offered, few dealers stock them and if you find one on a dealer's lot it will probably be a strippie because the dealer knows any manual transmission car will sit and sit and sit and sit on the lot or showroom floor (an unlikely place to find one). The dealer has to finance the stick shift car just like any other and then, ultimately, discount the car so much that repeating the process becomes about as far away from the dealer's mind as the nearest star (other than our sun).Some of the cars can be ordered with stick shifts, but again, we 'mericans want to cruise in on Saturday, test drive the car, buy it if we like it and take it home the same day. Gotta have it! Gotta have it!Moreover, getting a bunch of folks to pony up money or even letters of intent to a manufacturer to buy, en masse, stick shift cars hardly ever works. Quick story: my friend used to own an Audi/Porsche store in Cincinnati; he said AoA accepted a ""petition"" (""You cannot petition the lord with prayer"") to import A6's with manual transmissions (this was a few years back) -- well AoA was still in recovery mode from the '80s unintended acceleration fiasco and son-of-a-gun if AoA didn't begin offering A6's with 6-speed sticks.No one bought them (OK, VIRTUALLY no one bought them).The dealers and AoA probably felt like those cartoon characters who when fooled turn into a giant Tootsie-pop.The Acura TL AWD is offered with one of the sweetest and smoothest sticks in the biz -- MAYBE 3% of TL's are special ordered with a stick, maybe.The Audi A4 (I better check) can still be had with a 6-speed stick; but the 8-speed tip is a sweetie -- I wouldn't bother with the 6-speed manual anymore, especially if I had to worry about resale.Sure there are rabid, foaming at the mouth, stick-shift die hards who will pay a premium for a used car with a stick shift (and maybe even willing to do so for a new one), but there aren't many of them, so one's ability to sell the car when one wants to (or when the dealer wants to -- meaning in the same YEAR as they acquired it, for instance) is very uncertain, compared to the same car with the auto.How about this: Let's see if we can get 500 people to send in deposits to -- which car maker and for which model? No way we could get 500 folks to agree to order the same car -- no way would that many people want a (pick one.)I doubt we could even get 50 of us to pool our ""votes"" (read MONEY) to make it worth any manufacturer's while to let us buy one of their manual transmission versions of the XYZ model that they sell in other markets but not here. Not gonna happen, again ""You cannot petition the lord with prayer.""I say qwiturbitchin' at least here -- virtually all ELLPS and probably literally all LPS cars only are offered with automatics (and pretty soon, I'll wager, only autos will be offered due to any real marketplace interest in stick shifts.)Folks that will actually buy stick shifts are about as hard to find (from the manufacturer's perspective) as living survivors of the Civil War.There, I'm over them [stick shifts not Civil War survivors], too.Drive it like you live. ""You cannot petition the lord with prayer"" quote - The Doors from the album ""The Soft Parade""  "
"markcincinnati","January 2012"," Even though I accept today's automatics as excellent pieces of tech -- I must admit that I do, still, enjoy manual transmissions.Having said that, I still believe manuals will soon pretty much disappear from the automotive landscape.On the other hand, you gotta admire, somewhat, Buick for bringing out a couple of new cars these past 12-24 months that offer sticks (of course the dealers say they are novelties, not really someting that has much of a market.)More's the pity.

"fedlawman","January 2012"," Because of the economic meltdown, car prices have stayed pretty stable since 08, yet features and performance have continued to climb. New MY2012 cars like the A6, 5-series, and C-Class got major revisions without rising significantly in price.However, I think the biggest difference in value is in the compact car segment, where quality and features have skyrocketed in the past few years. Cars like the Focus and Cruze offer economy, performance, refinement and luxury unheard of in their segment back in 2008. "
"markcincinnati","January 2012"," I agree with your last paragraph. We're entering a period where ""less is more"" insofar as our choices in autos goes.It used to be only ""bigger is better"" and that only the big cars got the ""more is more"" treatment.I had (or my wife had, better said) three Audi TT's, the last two were the high performance models (at the time) with the 225HP 4 cylinder (1.8). Due to a timing issue, I had the distinct ""pleasure"" (not really) of having her last TT as my daily driver for a month or so.God, I felt like a bug when I drove it on I-71 in rush hour. A big semi (with trailer) would damn near blow me away -- or so it felt.Now the car was nimble and very peppy and all that -- but damn, get me the hell outta here! This was my daily mantra.When I then got my 2005 A6, I felt much better -- then when my 2009 A4 came in with a ~110"" wheelbase and a wide stance, I felt better still.Currently in our garage is an '11 Infiniti FX35 AWD and a '12 Acura TL AWD -- I have grown to like and pretty much can say, now after many months have passed, that I love driving either one of them.As big as the Acura is, it is amazing to me that it only has a 109"" wheelbase, yet it feels bigger still than my previous A6. Less is more, indeed.Can't wait to come up with some excuse to test the new 3 series -- but I will, of course, await the X-drive model, as I simply wouldn't even consider 2WD period.Best time ever, to be in the market -- yup!

"flightnurse","January 2012"," Excellent post and yes the compact car segment has gotten better, I mean, leather interior, bluetooth, smooth ride, and quality interior, but it comes with a price, a fully loaded cruze is $26K, the new Buick Verano fully loaded is 30K so get these these goodies costs too. "
"flightnurse","January 2012"," The only thing the 6 has over the 4 is the smoothness of the engine and for some people that means a lot. There is no 4 cyl that will be as smooth as the BMW inline 6... "
"sweendogy","January 2012"," We will see flight if the is the case- I dont think BMW would put a crappy engine in a 5. Talk smooth all you want but Mpgs and acceleration is what brings people gets people hot. "
"shipo","January 2012"," Smoothness comes in two flavors, the first is engine balance, and the second is power delivery.Engine Balance: - The only match I know of for an I-6 in this metric is an H-4, an H-6, or a V-12. Pretty much every other engine configuration suitable for an automobile will develop ordered vibrations at some level.Power Delivery: - Engines of the 4-Stroke / 4-Cylinder (or fewer) variety suffer from noticeable ""torque reversal"" events; in the case of the four pot motor, there are two such events per revolution of the crank. What is a ""Torque Reversal"" event? A state where the power delivery of the last cylinder to fire has waned to the point where it can no longer sustain engine rotation and when the next cylinder to fire has yet to wax to the point where it can sustain said rotation. Considering 4-Stroke engines apply over 90% of their power between a point twenty degrees after TDC and twenty degrees before BDC, there are two forty degree periods per rotation of the crank where the engine mechanicals and the flywheel are driving the engine.Remediation: - The remediation of natural engine imbalance of I-4 engines has been known for a very long time, simply keep displacement to roughly two liters or less and apply two (im)balance shafts rotating at twice engine RPM (one to either side of the block), and the natural vibrations of the engine are effectively cancelled out. - The remediation of torque reversal events is both easier and not as complete; it is easier because the manufacturer only needs to add a heavier flywheel to effectively dampen out the events. The thing is, dampening isn't as ""complete"" (for lack of a better word) as cancelling; the torque reversals will always be there, it will just be very difficult to sense them.Final thoughts: All intermittent combustion engines exhibit torque peaks and valleys, even the monster 18 cylinder R-2800 ""Double Wasp"" and the even monsterer 28-Cylinder R-4360 ""Wasp Major"". That said, once beyond the 6-Cylinder threshold the ""valleys"" don't step into the realm of negative torque and are thus imbued with a property called ""smoothness"". Six cylinder engines, even BMW's vaunted I6 models, do venture briefly into the negative torque territory three times per revolution, but the excursion below the line of zero torque is so shallow and so short in duration, they too have been given accolades for their smoothness.For my part, if BMW's new(ish) turbocharged 2.0 liter I-4 is engineered to be ""only as smooth"" as the 2.0T in our new GTI, it will be more than smooth enough for me.  "
"markcincinnati","January 2012"," Great post -- I nominate it for ""one of the great posts"" awards (as if there is such an award.)If the new BMW turbo 4 is as smooth as the 4 that was in my 2009 A4, I would be delighted. Knowing how time and tide tend to mean incremental improvements are possible (because of the passage of time -- plus a stack of $100 bills), I would assume this new BMW engine will be even smoother. Love the higher HP (and slightly higher torque) than in the Audi 2.0T -- makes me wonder if the tuner shops won't be bringing out some Fritos to up the torque, big time and even boost the HP by at least another 10 or so.31 months to go on my '12 Acura TL lease. Of course Audi may well come out with their new and improved 2.0T, in that time period too.And with $4.00/gal gasoline coming soon to a pump near you, these 4-cylinder engines keep getting more and more attractive.Drive it like you live. :shades: "

"flightnurse","January 2012"," I never said, ""crappy"" engine, I was expecting the new turbo 4 to be a power house and it is. However most people know that BMW has 6 cyl engines and to sell a $46K call with a 4 cyl is a tough sell, but the little engine produces some good number but in 0-60 and MPG. BMW learned it's lesson with the 318i, talk about ""crappy"" engine. "

"sweendogy","January 2012"," I would love to see the deal one would get with 31 mths remaining on a lease on a 2011 TL and reselling that TL on an Audi lot. That sounds like a ""leader ad"". Back on the 4cyl . the old 6 was a fine engine and it sold very well(leased even better) but BMW and the world is looking at 100 (98 and change close today) oil- which will continue to rOll into the pump prices. Even at 45-50k people hate the 80 dollar gas hit 2-3 times a month. 4cyls are here to stay.

It is fun to come off the line and leave everything behind too, but it cost to do that.I also wonder if they did bring the 550d to the states, how much it would run, considering the 335d is about 6K premium over the 335i.

"flightnurse","February 2012"," The only turbo 4, 3 series that is being sold in the US is not an xdrive that wont arrive until later this year. New 2013 3 Series starts off at 34K, however if you want the sport model, that bumps the price up a couple of grand, you can build a ""strip"" 2013 sport for roughly 37K. Of course when you add leather, premium package add $3600, Tech package and Cold weather package you are looking at 45K. What other package do you want? "
"dino001","February 2012"," Yeah, I've seen the new pricing scheme. While it has nice sound to it (Sport - Modern - Luxury), it is basically a racket to extract more money. Want certain color of exterior or interior? Pony up for 18"" wheels, too. I've never been a big wheel afficionado, as long as they are not too drab, 17"" wheels generally sufficient, heck even 16"" would be OK with me. The whole scheme of binding wheels with colors/inlays is clearly done to disguise a real price hike - which is to be expected, considering material, development costs, etc. One can still find one color/leather combination without the whole ""line"" thing, but that's probably left just to feed those $399/month (or whatever) or ""starting at..."" commercials when the model makes it to the TV.But there is nothing new. If one wants to be first on the block, pay up. Couple of years from now, the price will stay the same, but some of that stuff will be a no-cost option. Just like with the outgoing model - leather, Ipod/USB integration, couple of other things were either added to standard, or became no-cost options. Just a matter of time. "

"nyccarguy","February 2012"," I've only owned new my entire driving life from 2 weeks after I got my license in 1992. I'm not going to be in the market for another car for a while. A 3 year old 2013 X3 or 328i w/ X drive off lease with a little more than 45K on the clock for $25 - $28K represents a fantastic value compared to their respective almost $50 something thousand dollar MSRPs. I know they've been well maintained & will run for a long time. With young children, it would be much smarter of me to buy a $28K car as opposed to a $48K car. I'll let you know when the time comes. Right now, my TSX gives me the sporty ride I need for my daily commute & my Prelude Type SH gives me ""yeah baby"" for once or twice a week I crave brilliant handling. Your 135i is a fantastic car for the money. "
"dino001","February 2012"," The idea of buying used cars is great, the problem with it is that there were no cars matching my list anywhere within 2 thousand miles - in fact there are not cars even close to one I wanted. Manual tranny - nope, wagon - nope, combined - forget it. So I got a new one. Of course I (over)paid, but did it willingly. When I spent 45 grand this Fall, I decided that the car will be EXACTLY the way I want it, as long as it is available - not close, not more-less, exactly. And it had all those ""full depreciation"" items: Nav, HID (part of convenience package), sports package. I was initially against 2-grand Navigation, thought Garmin would do, but they dropped the price by $600 when combined with Premium package, making the price more pallatable.My general stance on depreciation I don't care, because I buy a car for myself, not the next owner. I also like to keep it 6 to 8 years, as long as it's in good shape and has no major issues. At that point the depreciation is not such a big issue anyway . Doesn't always work this way; as a matter of fact, just traded a three-year-old Subaru STI, but that one was from the get-go intended to be a transition car. BTW, the depreciation came out just great, as I paid in November '08 $33K with all taxes and fees (even got no-interest loan on top) and sold it last week for $22.8K - less than $300/month!). So it worked out, even though I didn't care about it. Don't expect a similar miracle with my 328i wagon though. But again - as long as it stays in shape, I'll keep it. Until now there was always ""the next car"", even at the very moment of purchase. This time there is no ""next car"" for me, not from what they have to offer. Perhaps, if Audi brings S4 wagon again (but they won't), or the new 3-series Gran Turismo (MY 2013 and beyond) comes in 335i flavor and manual tranny (which it probably won't), or they go really crazy and make M3 or M5 in some hatchback/wagon flavor (which they won't).

"flightnurse","February 2012"," HOwever if you buy the car with cash then you don't have much to worry about. With BMW, you get the 4yr 50K full warrenty, with my 2011 I added it up 6yrs 100Kmiles.

"flightnurse","February 2012"," Preaching is what you are doing. The group you are talking to now the ins and out of depreciation, cars and how to get the best deal.If you pay cash for your car there is no interest in the purchase, so the dollar outlay is less. I paid $39K (out the door) for my 2011 328i. In four years if I sell it for $30K I lost only 9K, I wont have more then 35K miles on the car, so selling it or trading it in wont be a problem.

I didn't offer it for your exclusive benefit.By the way, you won't be selling a 4-year-old 328i for $30k.

Especially q who is our resident auction maven & 135i driver and flightnurse who tracks his ZHP on a regular basis & found an awesome E90 low optioned 328i w/ SP & stick. ""Can't we all just get along?""Like I stated, I've only bought (or leased) new cars since the glorious day I got my license back in August 1992. I'm happy with my 2010 Acura TSX as a DD (could use more power, hydraulic steering, & MUCH better brakes), but am not head over heels in love with it (like I am my 2001 Prelude Type SH). My TSX was also a car that I bought originally for my wife with Cash 4 Clunkers money that I knew I'd be driving on the weekend, but not every day. This changed when we decided to have a 3rd child and now needed a bigger vehicle. Bought her a 2011 Pilot, The 2010 TSX becomes my DD, & my beloved Prelude gets driven once or twice a week (yes it gets the garage with the Pilot).I'm always thinking (building online & checking out used car values) about what's next. I know the financially smart thing to do is to pay off the TSX (just refinanced), and drive it with no payment until the wheels fall off. Cars are my ""thing."" I've been hooked on BMWs ever since I drove a friend's '95 E36 325is (stick, sport) through the streets of Buffalo one winter night when I was in college. I leased my wife an '07 X3 and just loved the way it drove. It was never in the shop once except for scheduled maintenance. With 3 kids and a mortgage, I think it would be selfish of me to go out and buy an almost $50K car (328xi or X3). If in a few years, I can muster together a small down payment, then I can convince the board of directors (my wife) that this Mid to high used $20K BMW (X3 or 328xi) is what i want and I think it'll last, then I'll go for it! Life's way too short to drive boring cars. "
"qbrozen","February 2012"," Hey, don't forget my poor 540. :P You reminded me... I wanted to also say that's the one nice thing about the Acura (well, seems to be most Japanese vehicles): low-to-no options. There is something to be said for simplicity and standard features.The Germans are notoriously horrible in that regard. I was shocked to see at a Porsche show that you could actually option up a base Boxster into 911 GTS territory! "
"dino001","February 2012","  paid $39K (out the door) for my 2011 328i.

Unless you got something like 10 grand discount (which I doubt), it was probably base plus one package, no sunroof, no sports, no HID. "
"nyccarguy","February 2012"," Something that I do love about my Acura. Tech pkg was the only option. Auto was a no cost option. Porsche's options are insane. It is cool how customizable the cars are from the factory. My Mom drives a 2011 V6 Cayenne. I think there are only 3 options on it, but one is a $10,000 option package. It is crazy if you ever look on a Porsche dealer's website to see inventory. Some of them have PDK equipped base boxsters with $70K + MSRPs. "
"flightnurse","February 2012"," I would like to hear from the regulars of this group if I shouldn't have made the comment ""he group you are talking to now [sic] the ins and out [sic] of depreciation"" is false!Regarding my 328i, first you are making an assumption that my 328 is a strip down car, MSRP was almost 47K, the GM ordered this car as an experiment and it failed on him. Here in Phoenix, 99% of all 3 series cars (non M cars) are sold with automatics, the GM wanted to see if he ordered a 328i with M sport package, (leather was a free option on my 328) xenon head lights, keyless access, cold weather package, moon roof would sell, and it did't not sale, it sat on the lot for 5 months. I must have hit the showroom at the right time, that is why I got the smoking deal. So yes most base 328 with very little options are selling at mid to low 20s. BTW, the average buyer can not get cars at auction prices so that is a mood point. So currently at one of the local BMW dealers in Phoenix, has 2 BMW 328s with the M sport package with 40 and 49K miles are asking 28 and 30K for them. Mine will have less then 40K and keep in pristine condition with all the right option. "
"flightnurse","February 2012"," Yes porsche does have a nice long list of options, I was looking at a Caynne GTS, however when I optioned it out how I want it, it was 93K.... "
"dino001","February 2012"," So, you say you got $47K MSRP for $39K with taxes (that's what OTD means in my dictionary)? Even with dealer incentives, it's still five grand below dealer cost. Wow, on that I can only say your it sounds just too good to be true, but since you say you got it, congratulations and kudos. Now, on the resale: I'm no expert, I just sold a three year old car last week. First, the fact that dealers post $30K on something, doesn't mean you can sell same thing for that. Buyers don't care about auction prices, but dealers do when they take a trade. If you want to sell it individually, be prepared for weeks of no phone calls interrupted by text messages from people wanting to give you less that dealer would. I just went through that personally just in last month. Finally I sold it, but the reality was quite painful. You may have more patience and you obviously have more luck than me, so who knows. Well, it is funny you said about the ""experiment"" car. That's very close to what I got (no M package, but regular sports package, convenience pkg and Nav). The car was about $46.5K MSRP. Nowhere near your discount, but it was ordered, so no reason to go below costs either. "
"sweendogy","February 2012"," Your story sounds alot like those ""leader adds"" that manufactures put on there websites. Sorry guy "
"flightnurse","February 2012"," dino I can only say the ""experiment"" was the word the GM used to me, I had no reason not to believe him, why would the car sit on the lot for 5 months with no bites. the Color combo was great, the options were right on the mark, except it was a manual and not an auto. "
"nyccarguy","February 2012"," I'm sure you got calls from some serious characters selling your STi (right?). What were you offered by your BMW dealer on the trade? How much more did you get selling the car privately?Flightnurse - auction values are relevant because that's what you are offered (at least here in the north east) for your trade. I'm trying to talk myself into buying used next time around, so I'm trying to look at the glass as half full. Most BMWs here in the north east are leased for 3 years. When the lease is up, the car has anywhere from 30K to 45K miles on it. The car is still under warranty, has had all maintenance done by the dealer (ok, so not by Mike Miller's old school maintenance schedule) and is still in relatively good condition. It might have a new set of tires, fresh oil, and at least front brake pads & rotors. BMWs are wonderfully built machines who's life is FAR from over when the 50K mile warranty expires. "
"dino001","February 2012"," Again, manual is just for me. Now, if I could only believe somebody would take 5+ grand loss just to get rid of it. I did some basic math. $47K MSRP car is about $44K invoice. Then we may have dealer incentive (2011 is last year of the model), say 2 grand or so. So to get to $39K OTD we have price at $35K-$36K. That's possible 6 grand hit. Say there is another thousand or two lying around with the mfr - still 4 grand loss. Dealer finances inventory at say 6 APR on their revolving account (maybe more, I don't know, but it seems reasonable). Car is $43 or so invoice, which means it cost the dealer about 2.5 grand to finance it over full year. Why would one take this hit after just five months? Is there something you want to tell us?  "
"dino001","February 2012"," Yeah, that was the worst part. Those jokers from 300 miles away sending you a text ""would you take XXXX"" . The long story was in December I got $22.5K offer from dealer ('08 STI, 37K miles, perfect interior, some scratches on exterior - $36.5K new MSRP, got it for $33 OTD - Subaru had $2.5K bonus cash then, it was November '08, Lehman Bros. just declared bankruptcy). Should have taken it right then. I decided to put in on Autotrader. Couple of serious calls, joker texts, showed it to one serious buyer, no avail, wife would not let him. At last, got a second buyer - lady buying it for her son (actually it is his money, but she's still calling the shots). It is month and a half from the time, I'm a little exhausted and she read me well. Bottom line - accepted 22.8K, which basically is about my ""storage"" costs added to the dealer's offer. But time passage also impacts the depreciation, so I think a dealer's offer today would be less than then. Playing it back in my head, I probably left five hundred to thousand on the table - but it's done, moving on. I take it as a lesson.Weird thing is, Edmunds TMV is far, far less than Kelley/NADA, not only on dealer retail, but also on trade. This is first time I saw such discrepancy - usually it is that Edmunds tells you trade is more than Kelley/NADA, but retail is less. Here, they all three values down by several thousands. I think it has something to do with low supply due the tsunami. Seeing my transaction, I'm inclined to thing Edmunds is wrong this time - it looks to me as a computer calculating price based on predicted value rather than actual asking/transaction prices, which seem to be in Kelley/NADA case. "
"sweendogy","February 2012"," Experiment = leader add? Are you sure its not a 323 you own and not a 328? "
"dino001","February 2012"," Those are sold in Canada, but not US. "
"qbrozen","February 2012"," Regarding my 328i, first you are making an assumption that my 328 is a strip down car ...No, I'm not. Actually, I'm assuming it has the right options. In the used car world, most options are assumed to be there and you start deducting when they aren't. So when I said $20k, that assumed premium package and auto trans, at the least. I didn't realize you had a stick. So the $22k is probably generous.You apparently don't understand depreciation as you said you did because you failed to realize my main point, which is that most options add zero-to-very-little value to a used car. BTW, the average buyer can not get cars at auction prices so that is a mood [sic] point. Thanks for that. Did you wonder why I posted selling prices as well as auction prices? :confuse: So currently at one of the local BMW dealers in Phoenix, has 2 BMW 328s with the M sport package with 40 and 49K miles are asking 28 and 30K for them. Good for them. But, as your own buying story indicates, asking price and selling price are vastly different things. I'd also bet those are CPO. "
"dino001","February 2012"," Nurse may be a classic example of somebody who assumes they should get their car 20% below invoice, but same car should sell later 20% above dealer retail, just for mere fact of them keeping it in a garage and washing it every week.  Look for highest dealer asking price in their area, add another twenty percent to that is and then say ""That's the value of my car"". LOL I disagree a bit with you on options. There is some ""basic level"" assumed, which usually may be above stripper, but there are options adding value, at least in first couple of years. Manual transmission does not have to be a value subtracting proposition for BMW - the car is rare enought to attract a few sporty stick shift afficionados, especially with M-package. That's a good combo. May not attract a buyer first day, but chances are those who show up may be more motivated - of course there will also be jokers as well. "

"dino001","February 2012"," Now, THAT IS funny  "
"qbrozen","February 2012"," but there are options adding value, at least in first couple of yearswell, yes, of course. Those that I detailed in one of my posts above. With BMWs, for example, premium is assumed. Sport adds value, as does Nav. They do, however, as I said, suffer worse depreciation than the rest of the car. A stick does hurt it at trade time, but you are correct that it doesn't have to hurt it at selling time. Dealers do the same thing. That's a sort of joke I've told before, and complained to salespeople about, too... they'll tell me ""nobody wants it"" when trading it to them, but then its ""rare/hard to come by!"" when buying it from them. So poor stick drivers get the shaft coming and going. "
"dino001","February 2012"," I agree - options do depreciate faster than base. I heard that Toyota actually accounts for that in their lease formulas (different residual percentage for base and different for options), which is probably smart thing for their protection, but will significantly increase lease payment for loaded models.

Right on the money!dino - I know the ride, build quality (solidness), RWD handling balance are very different between your 328iT & your WRX STi, but how are you holding up with the severe power differences between the 2 cars.Q - I totally agree with you regarding the auction values of cars, that's what you get from the dealer whether it is a 10/10 or a 7/10. They deduct more if the car is in rough shape and don't add so much if the car is truly exceptional.Sometimes, if you have the perfect car for the perfect buyer, things can work out in both of your favors. Back in 1998, when we graduated college a friend of mine had to have a Mustang Convertible with a stick. He special ordered a V6 (VEE SIX) Mustang Convertible with a stick. We tell him he's NUTS because everyone who wants a Mustang with a Stick Shift is going to want a GT (V8) & he's going to have a lot of trouble selling the car when the time comes. To say my friend is anal about how he keeps his cars is and understatement. He also made it look like a GT (Dual Exhaust, Rear Bumper to Integrate dual exhaust, fake hood scoop...).Fast forward to 2003. He Special orders a MINI Cooper S. His MINI comes in and he starts looking into selling his Faux GT V6 5 SPeed Mustang Convertible. I do some research for him & tell him that given the way domestics depreciate & given his car is a complete odd ball to expect to get maybe $11K TOPS for the car.He lists it himself anyway after getting trade in offer of like $10-$10,5 (Plus paying full sticker for the MINI). He gets a call from some 16 year old kid who wants a Mustang with a stick, but insurance (& his parents) prohibits him from buying a V8. He likes the stick, the convertible, (Mom Likes the V6), & most importantly the faux GT styling. I think my friend got $16K for his car. "
"dino001","February 2012"," Well, I don't miss that power because I didn't really need it at the first place. I already feel my 41 years of age, so kid cars don't excite me as much. I got that STI because it was a deal one could not resists. Nice to get and have for a while, but glad it's over now. Traded these horses for better mileage, refinement, quiet cabin, and good stuff inside with no regrets. It is 230 hp vs 305, but in torque it is [email?protected] vs [email?protected], which means at low end the difference is less and delivery is linear. 328 is deceptively quick - not explosive or screaming, but it is just enough. I like it just the way it is. "
"sweendogy","February 2012"," I find it funny that it's mid feb and no sedan on local dealers lot - maybe because I live in AWD country and they have yet to build them. "
"dino001","February 2012"," 2012 3XXix and 335d sedan will be still old body and engines, just like coupe and convertible. I don't have any insider info, but new Fxx body will probably be 2013 for those. No way to say when, if all of it will come at fall, or if they space it out from spring to winter, as they usually do. Strategically it is better to have something to talk about every three months than have big talk once, but production lines have to be switched. When I was in Munich in October, they were making both new sedan and old wagon bodies on the same line, but that may be unique to that place.For now, new body/engine will only be on 328i and 335i sedans, which is announced, but I don't think it has come to lots yet. "
"graphicguy","February 2012"," Around OH, KY, IN, TN, etc, a loaded 328i with M and other options are tough to come by. They usually reserve those options for the 335i. That said, $47K for a 328i is a ton of money. I can buy a 335i for less than that.That said, BMW dealers don't sell at a loss. They'll hold on to a 328i like you describe, use it as a loaner, or a demo. But, dealers sell just about all the ones they can get their hands on. IF you bought it at $7K-$8K off MSRP, the option list may not be what is reported, or it has a bunch of miles on it as a demo/loaner.BTW.....took my 3er in to have the oil changed (6K miles, paid for it out of my own pocket....next one is on BMW), and they let me drive a '12 328i sedan. Interesting with a 4 cy...drive train's a lilttle rough.... uncharacteristic of a BMW. Significantly down on power compared to mine, too.From the outside, you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference between an '11 and a '12. Interesting interior (don't know the name of it). Looks like the interior of a 5 series. IF you like the 5, you'll like the new 3.But, as mentioned, the coupe/'vert for '12 is the same as my '11 coupe. So, not significant changes there for awhile.Ride, handling, etc? About the same as an '11.As I told my sales person (who is always nice to me when I stop by), ""I'd take a steeply discounted '11 over this ""updated"" '12"".He agreed with me.Should be interesting to see the sales numbers this year. They say MPG will go way up on the '12. But, I'm getting 23-24 MPG in mixed driving on mine, already. And, I've got a heavy right foot. "
"flightnurse","February 2012"," Motor Trend reported that only the Sedan will be available for 2012, coupe and convertible will be old body style. Mid summer BMW will release the M package for the 328i and 335i. A 4 cyl diesel to be released by fall (look for mid 40's highway mpg.) The 6 cyl diesel will be dropped from the 3 series completely when the 4 cyl diesel is released. "
"flightnurse","February 2012"," In Phoenix I test drove a 2012 328i sport with tech package and assorted goodies, price was 42K. I liked it, the turbo 4 pulls very strong, yes it is faster then 2011 328i, the car has more room in it, and an adult that is 6 ft tall can fit in the rear seat comfortably. Over all nice car, the new M package will give more power to the turbo 4, dealer does not know how much though, however i'm guessing 10-15hp more, kind of like the 330i with the ZPH package did. Sween I doubt BWM dealers in your neck of the woods wont a regular 328i they want it with iDrive, wont happen until fall. The there are a couple of big markets for 3 series, So Florida, So Cal and Nor Cal, so I'm guess those markets and markets close to them will have first choice of cars. "
"flightnurse","February 2012"," You are assuming too much, first off, I wasn't looking to buy a car the day I bought mine, however, the offer was presented to me, thought about it, retested the car, liked it, and bought it. I didn't sit and haggle with them at all, the price was written on a piece of paper, and was explained about the ""experiment"" he (the GM) tried, it failed, and he wanted to move the car, he was losing money on the car. I figured he would make up the difference he lost on the car from others who purchased cars. 2 weeks after buying the car, I went back to the dealership and purchased the extra 2 yr 50K extended warranty (bumper to bumper.) So when I sell my car, I know I should get the price I want. My cars are kept in pristine condition, and all service work done to them. So please save your arm chair quarter backing for your friends and co-workers. "
"nyccarguy","February 2012"," I completely understand your liking the 328xit over the STi for its refinement & other aspects you mentioned. A 328 isn't blazing fast, but has no trouble getting up to speed & will cruise all day long on the right side of the 80 mph hash mark.The STi has always been a screaming performer, but at the end of the day it is still an almost $40K car. "
"qbrozen","February 2012"," LOL "
"dino001","February 2012"," All I can say good luck - I really hope you can get it. Send us a report fours years from now, would you?  "
"dino001","February 2012"," Small correction - mine does not have ""x"" (it's a RWD - so yes I switched from AWD to RWD). They also stopped adding ""t"" in wagons (stands for ""touring""), but it would still apply if they had  . Anyway, I love it. It is all I wanted - no more, no less. I only have two complaints - dashboard looks like it is 15 years old, designwise, and the cupholders/armrest storage really suck. I think of BMW design process like this: they develop/refine engines and transmissions for 4 years, they obsess about new/improved suspension and steering for 2 years, exterior styling takes them about 10 months, then two weeks before the premier Hans just realized they forgot about the instrument cluster (again  ) - so they pull one from the previous generation (which was used in one before that), slightly change fonts and send it to the marketing department... :surprise: "
"dino001","February 2012"," That said, $47K for a 328i is a ton of money. I can buy a 335i for less than that. Yeah, but then you don't get a few things. My wagon was $46.5K MSRP. It took sports, premium, convenience and Nav. I guess you don't really need Nav and half of the convenience (HID is a must, but keyless start or rear sunshades are not). I would not get one without premium and sports, if not just for seats. If those seats were sold separately, I'd get them and could live with all-season rubber, on standard rims., normal suspension and speed limit at 130 (although I got it to 138 mph on German autobahn, but well  ) What's funny is realization than when compared with sedan, the wagon is actually cheaper, even though it starts higher. Sedan doesn't have standard fold down seats ($500, which is absolutely ridiculous - what's worse I noticed dealers actually don't order them - can only imagine surprise on somebody's face first time they try to fold seats :sick: ), is also has no sunroof (which I understand tall people may actually prefer not to have). What's more, the wagon's sunroof is ""panoramic"" (about half longer, because it can fold under longer roof) - absolutely awesome, puts  every time I reach for the button. Wonder if the new 328i has still fold-down seats optional. "
"graphicguy","February 2012"," dino....haven't looked at the 3 series wagons. Matter of fact, I don't think I've even seen one around here....regardless of model year.I still think it will be interesting to see what the market will do as the ""new"" 3 series (and 5 series) have a base 4 cyl (albeit, turbo). I know Audi has been pushing their A4 with 4 cyl motors, and that MB is doing it with their new C series.But, $40K+ large for a 4 cyl car is a bit of a stretch IMHO. You lose the smoothness of their 6, which is world class. I know they said the '12 328i is as fast as the previous gen 6 cyl, but it may have been lost on me. I've driven the previous 6 cyl 328. The '12 certainly doesn't feel nearly as quick.Should be interesting! "
"dino001","February 2012"," It is all government's CAFE standards. Has nothing to do with actual market demand. They're doing it because they have to. By reports new 328i is even faster than previous and uses 20% less fuel. Mine getting the wagon now was no coincidence - the 6-cylinder NA engine was a big part of that decision. Didn't want to wait for the new 328i GT.BTW, EVERYBODY who actually sees it is person says it looks better than sedan, more sporty, better lines. Perhaps there is some flattery there, but I think the same. You get sedan's handling (car is identical up to center pillar), extra boot, and better styling? Yet, you know, it is America. They don't buy anything with word ""wagon"" in it... "
"dino001","February 2012"," Small correction. I believe there is some demand for fuel efficient 3-series. But would be much better satisfied by a lower priced and even more efficient 320i (or whatever the naming would be) with something like 180 hp engine and price point slightly below current A4. Those would really sell to completely new customer base. But would probably not satisfy their CAFE goals. "
"qbrozen","February 2012"," That's kind of where this whole concept gets lost on me, too. There are easier way to skin the CAFE cat, so I have a hard time buying it as an excuse for turbocharged cars. Agree with you wholeheartedly that an NA 4-cyl wouild be even more efficient WHILE expanding their customer base. Even better than that, however, I would like to see them bring a smaller, lighter, 4-cyl base option here. Would increase efficiency considerably more. How about the 3-door and 5-door 120i? Wouldn't that be a helluva lot easier than constantly developing new engines? The 3-series is SUCH a porker now, which is the only reason I picked the 1 instead. "
"sweendogy","February 2012"," Is it stupid of BMW to release a Rwd only 328 and 335 in the new body style and have the old body awd cars sitting next to them with the same model year 2012 - am I missing something, it's mid feb - what took them so long to get the 2012s rolling . I understand the coupe convert saying the same body- wagon ok . But to have xdrive models in old carb , why? "
"dino001","February 2012"," That may actually be twofold: engineering (fitting xdrive to the chassis) and manufacturing (retooling factories). They could have discontinue it altogether, but they elected to keep selling those. I don't know if I would call it stupid, but it's a little unusual to see models that seem to differ by just drive system. "
"cdnpinhead","February 2012"," . . .expanding their customer base.BMWNA has made it abundantly clear that they aren't interested in expanding their customer base that way -- mere plebians could then afford to drive a new BMW, and that'd never do. They prefer to sell (or, more often, lease) to those who aspire to the biggest baddest most expensive possible lifestyle, and it appears to work very well for them.However, the majority of the customer base that reads and responds to Roundel articles predominantly drive the older cars because they think like you (and I) do. BMWNA could give a rip less about the enthusiast market; they're here to get cars on the road, and the people who care about such things are a mere sliver of the market -- the sliver that got the brand going, but that was then and this is now.Oh boy. :sick: "
"sweendogy","February 2012"," Sorry rest of the country but I would bet te majority of the US 4 door cars are sold up east- and would say 80% are with x-drive north of DC. I would of thought BMW would have figured out the drive system - its feb 13th. "
"dino001","February 2012"," You still can have it, just not in a new body. Plus, remember it's a global car - vast majority is sold in RWD config, x-drive is a recent development (less thasn 10 years). How do you get percentage anyway? Don't judge by what you see. Southeast, Southwest, California, Midwest, are mostly 2WD. And it's ""would have thought"", not ""would of thought""  "
"nyccarguy","February 2012"," There's got to be a damn good reason that BMW released the new F30 3er in RWD guise only, especially since the car debuted in February. For the record, we've had snow stick to the ground exactly twice so far. "
"nyccarguy","February 2012"," A $47K 328i is expensive, but hardly unheard of. Back in December 2007, my Mom ordered & leased a 2008 328xi with an MSRP of $46,000 + without the sports package & without navigation.Most 335s out there have an MSRP in the $50K range. "
"nyccarguy","February 2012"," I agree & disagree with some points you make about BMW. You know that personally I think BMWs are insanely expensive. They are well worth the cost of admission. I'd love a NA 4cyl 3er or a small 6 pot 320i that I could buy for the low to mid $30K range. However, I don't think we're going to get it.I'm a BMWCCA member & enjoy reading ROUNDEL every month. We enthusiasts make up such a small percentage of the market, that we barely even register on BMWs radar screen.BMW is in the business of selling cars and making a profit doing so. Some of the ROUNDEL letters I read every month drive me crazy. ""I can't believe BMW won't import the F10 5 series wagon..."". Well, BMW sold LESS than 900 (nine hundred) of these during the last year of E60 production.Dino100 - I think your RWD, stick, sport pkg wagon is way cool. "
"dino001","February 2012"," I just read something in my warranty/service booklet. Spark plugs - new 4-cyl turbo needs them every 30K miles (528i and Z4 28i already have new engine), while most old 6-cylinder, turbo or not, only at 60K miles - twice as long interval. Curious. It may be nothing, spark plugs are cheap, but I see it as a possible sign of things to come. Nothing is free. If you get 250 horses out of 2 litters, claim 20% lower fuel cost, somethings's got to give. We shall see in five years. "
"nyccarguy","February 2012"," While it has snowed exactly twice this season, luxury buyers expect their cars to have AWD here in the northeast. The northeast is a major market for BMW. The same way I'll bet there are 3 & 5 buyers that won't realize their 328 & 528 guise BMWs are powered by 4 cylinder engines, they might not even know that BMW makes RWD only vehicles.As (cheap) enthusiasts, we can only hope that in an attempt to sell a whole lotta cars that BMW leases out as many cars as possible so 3 years from now the used car market is flooded with well maintained, great driving BMWs. "
"nyccarguy","February 2012"," Glad you made the comment about the F30 having some decent rear headroom. One of my biggest gripes with the E90 is its dimunitive size. While perfect as a second car in a family or a single person, for someone like myself who has to have child safety seats in the car it is just too small. I love the way the E90 drives though.Interesting comments about the coarseness of the 4cyl turbo engine. Even though my Acura's I4 isn't the balanced wondeer that the BMW I6 is, it is a pretty damn smooth engine. "

"graphicguy","February 2012"," nyc.....$47K for a 4 cyl sedan is expensive, regardless of who makes it. You can get an awful lot of cars, with luxury name plates, that have a nice 6 cyl under the hood, for a whole lot less.I know BMW is spinning it as a move to better MPG. In this country, at least, that's a tough sell, however.I suppose some will fall into the showroom just because of the badge (just like those who pay major dollars for a C series, regardless of how whimpy the motor is in them).You can get a 335i for considerably less than $50K (discounted). I did it. "
"dino001","February 2012"," I also think it is surprising (and even disapointing) they could not get their duck in row with xdrive, but to me since RWD is BMW lineage anyway, I don't see this as a big blow. They have always done phase-in approach, but this one is a little odd, as there will be old and new sedans being sold at the same time with same badges, just one ""x"" or ""d"" (diesel is also old) letter difference. Strange and confusing to some to say the least.And you're welcome for the grammar lesson. As an immigrant (legal), I like to give back to the local folk. Nothing better than some literacy lessons .  :P (ducking and covering) "
"qbrozen","February 2012"," They may have made that clear ... but I don't think they were telling the truth.Why, then, do they have far cheaper examples in Europe? Why, then, do they offer a $31k 1-series? Frankly, I think claiming they don't WANT to offer it here is sour grapes. They don't believe there to be enough of a market to warrant it and/or they don't want to canibalize their own sales (would someone who stretched themself to buy a new 328 rather buy a 320? probably.), so they'd rather just say ""I don't wanna.""That's my uneducated guess, anyway. "
"fedlawman","February 2012"," I don't have a problem with a 4 cylinder BMW - Audi and Mercedes have them. The problem I do have is that NA isn't available anymore. People ranted on and on when the dipstick went away and the cars became ""leasers"" (keep it for 3 years then ditch it) because of the inability to self-maintain them. Shade tree mechanics used to love BMWs, but not these new ones. And now, with a turbo in all of the 3ers, BMW is telling ""don't even think of working on this car yourself."" They might as well remove the hood latch mechanism...As much as I like the engineering, performance, and economy of a turbo-4, I would never buy one. "
"qbrozen","February 2012"," I don't necessarily mind the electronic oil level gauge. BUT, the problem with it is you can't check the level without running the engine! Ummm... anyone else see a problem there? ""I think my oil is low, so I'd better run the engine to find out."" :surprise: "
"dino001","February 2012"," Why, then, do they have far cheaper examples in Europe? That's not entirely accurate description of their European offering. What they have there is lots of different versions and options with their smaller-engine offerings obviously are cheaper to manufacture, but their prices are HIGHER than here - and by higher I mean INSANE. They didn't have there ""old"" 328i (there were 325i and 330i, positioned just below/above in terms of hp, I believe these are same engines as those offered here before 2008), they have 335i just the same. If you configure one sold in German market to what sells here (largest in Europe), you come up with some ridiculous values. It would cost you there near double to get similar vehicle, I am not kidding (currency exchange already included). 335i for 100 grand anyone? A visit in BMW Welts is a real eye opener. A 1-series with smaller engine than here can cost you there equivalent of a base 5-series here. If you want to pay what we pay here, you come up with a base NA 4-cyl. engine, cloth seats, no extras of any kind. So it is not that people buy there 316i because they really want to and they simply don't like 335i, it's basicall most they can afford to buy. If you add their gas station bill being about double of ours, you get the picture. Oh no, if they'd take 328 or 335 in a heart beat if they paid what we pay. People, you don't even realize how tough US market is for those guys and how lucky (demanding) we really are. They pay labor rates higher than here (especially if you factor in taxes paid by the employer) then they have to come here and sell it for a little more than half the price they'd command in their domestic market. If you realize that, you wonder how they are able to sell anything here at a profit and still offer decent (perhaps not great) choices. On the flip side, there everybody gets choices upon choices, even in lower end brands. A typical 3-series price sheet is two pages here for a given body style, there it's a twenty-plus page booklet just for the same body style. People rarely buy from dealer's lots, they order and pick it up three to six months later. They often can't really test drive the car with engine they order (that's regardless of brand). Totally different experience. "
"nyccarguy","February 2012"," I agree that $47K is expensive for a 4cyl sedan. Heck, a 528xi w/ a 4cyl can be optioned well into the $60K range (yikes). I don't know if there is a stigma about driving a 4cyl car like there used to be back in the '80s & '90s. The ""serial leasse will no doubt take the F30 out on a test drive and feel it has the same amount (or more, I haven't driven one yet) of ""pickup."". The salesman mentions it's a 4cyl turbo that gets 30 something MPG on the highway. The customer hasn't driven a 4 cyl car since their early 1990's Toyota Tercel says: ""wow, 4 cyl engines sure have changed.""You got a fantastic deal on a smokin 335i w x drive coupe. So you are right, it is possible.BMW is a performance luxury brand. In the American market, performance (for the masses) is equated by 0-60 mph times. They don't want a 320i NA 4cyl in their stable that does the sprint in 7.5 - 8.5 sec. "
"qbrozen","February 2012"," OK, but what is the overall cost of living and average income? I mean, if we're talking US dollars here, is it just a matter of the US dollar being worth far less there? I'm not an economics guy by any stretch of the imagination (nor am I a world traveler), mind you, but I'm pretty sure something just simply costing more there means it is more expensive in relation to the average joe. Know what I mean?I know this is going back a ways, but I know base Benzes, for example, served taxi duty. I would guess that's because they are relatively cheap, no? Does that still hold true today? Are they still used for that purpose? "
"dino001","February 2012"," Yes, there was a loss of value of the dollar in recent years, which opened the gap further than before to those insane levels, but it has always been there, even during strong dollar times. America has always been a land of cheap cars and energy. The payoff was lack of sophistication, generally relatively fewer choices, lower expectations of quality, especially fit/finish. An American buys a car (used or new) with an expectation of a trade in next three-five years, European expects to to keep it ""for life"", even if they ultimately do not. That sets a tone, pretty dramatically. They spend much higher portion of their income and then their operating costs are also higher to their income, which sets expectations very high. You'd have to watch some Top Gear comments every time they get an American-made vehicle for a test. Ford Focus is sold there as ""family"" vehicle. It is sold with 1.4 and 1.6 engines. Ford Mondeo/(Contour/Fusion) is considered an ""middle level executive"" - also sold with 1.6-1.8 engine. In many countries there is a big tax and insurance penalty when you go over 2 litters. Denmark has new car registration fees at levels comparable to value of the car. I'm not kidding - people have been known to take loans to pay off registration tax. And the list goes on. Even Germans, most affluent of all Europe drive mostly VW, Fords and Opels in configurations that would make Americans laugh. Taxi Benz is nothing like Benz you see here, the only thing in common is the shell and the star on the hood. It used to be attractive for taxi because of durability of their base NA diesel engine vs. price relation to other brands. Regardless if you buy a Ford or Benz, you will spend much higher share of income, but Benz (used to) offer million mile durability, tons of spare parts available from knock off manufacturers. "
"dino001","February 2012"," but I'm pretty sure something just simply costing more there means it is more expensive in relation to the average joe.Don't want to sound condiscending, but Americans are really cute sometimes. Let me tell you what an average median income Joe Brit/Hans Deutch/Jose Span/Jaques the French get from life: They live in a 800 sf apartment in a multi-apartment house, commute to work with bus/trane and on weekends they drive a five-to-eight years old Ford Focus/Renault Megane/Opel Astra with 90-110 hp engine, most likely diesel. Dr. Hans or Dept. Manager Jaques have vastly better life - they live in 1500 sf house and commute in three-year-old Ford Mondeo/Peugeot 405 with 140 hp engine, also diesel. Regional Manager Julio just moved into 2000 sf house and bought a new BMW 520d (4-cylinder diesel) with cloth seats but a keyless entry, which he showed to every neighbor. Well, exact facts may differ slightly, but that's a general tone. When you understand those differences, the perspective changes dramatically. "
"qbrozen","February 2012"," Obviously, I had a typo in that statement. It should have been:I'm not an economics guy by any stretch of the imagination (nor am I a world traveler), mind you, but I'm pretty sure something just simply costing more there doesn't means it is more expensive in relation to the average joe.Just keep in mind, regardless of whether you find it cute or not, it doesn't mean what I said is incorrect. Everything is relative. Yes, if everything you say is true, then the cars apparently cost a larger portion of their income (although I have NO IDEA why). But since everything appears to be that way from what you are saying, then it is relatively on par with all living expenses, if you get my meaning.Its the same thing from state to state here. Gas, food, taxes, real estate all vary WIDELY across the country. I could live as a king in Texas for pauper wages in NJ. Hell, I'm middle management and I sure can't afford a new bimmer. "
"flightnurse","February 2012"," Regarding switching to a 4 cyl in a 40+ car, MB is doing it too and Audi had done it also, BMW just happens to be the last one to have a 4 cyl turbo in their line up. BTW, the new 5 series is selling very well, higher then BMW predictions. "
"flightnurse","February 2012"," Audi's A5 starts off at 38K and and top off at 50K with a 4 cyl turbo... MB will do the same with the E class soon enough. Not too sure why you and others think BMW is going backwards, but its typical American thinking, small is bad, bigger is better... "
"flightnurse","February 2012"," Dino you are so right, when I was in Germany to pick up my 330i, I stopped off at a BMW dealer, they had 3 new cars on their lot the rest were used BMW's. Also not too sure how many 316i bmw would sell, since people are complaining now about how horrible it is to have a BMW with a 4 cyl. "
"dino001","February 2012"," I knew what you meant to say and that was cute to me (assuming that is something is true in US, it must be universal), but let's not dwell on that. I meant to be funny, but I probably wasn't. The fact stays that United States is a world with BY FAR cheapest cars and energy, not just in terms of currency prices, but in terms of actual income percentage. It is also true about other items, such as certain electronics (iphone/ipad costs in Europe about twice what it does here, even more in China). The reasons for that to be the case are plenty, from general output (i.e. US is still in fact either highest of almost highest GNP/capita), combined with scale (even small price break could bring marginally more sales, which can fuel more price breaks). However, the biggest difference lies in market fragmentation (combined Europe is about US size, but each country has its own very separate ways and they don't interact in terms of retail) and more redistributive economy, i.e. higher taxation on all levels, from capital, to income, to consumption (e.g. Euro sales tax, called VAT is from 17 to 25%, Euro income taxes are progressive reaching 50% and beyond on top bracket, Euro social security taxes paid by employers as surcharge go into 30-50% territory, all depends on the country). There is also large amount of social engineering going on there as well, where ""undesirable behavior"" (such as owning large-displacement engine vehicle) is directly punished by the government through additional taxes and scrutiny. They also excert a direct pressure on manufacturers to make or not make certain products as well, a concept introduced to US just only recently. All this combines into really punitive taxes and high prices of ""unnecessary good"", which cars, especially luxury ones are perceived as.It gets even worse in poorer countries, almost inversely proportional to their wealth. Explanation for that may be in volume: even if MB or BMW lowered the price, they would not sell more product, so prices remain high to pay for higher distribution cost of smaller markets and the circle closes.

"dino001","February 2012"," To me it is not really the size of the engine, but its configuration. There are big advantages of straight six in terms of balance, smoothness, power delivery. Sure, you can make a screamer 4-cyl sewing machine producing same power as a larger I6, but the experience is not the same. Long term durability is also an open question. Europeans are already going through that now with their modern diesel engines - in quest of clean quite and high power turbo diesel, all advantages of old diesel (resiliency, low maintenance, million mile durability) are all but gone. Pour wrong fuel to your tank and you need new injectors. Put wrong oil and watch your car die... Sure, they are all nice, clean and quiet when new, but they last just about the same as gasoline engines, but still cost 30% more. "

"Kirstie_H","February 2012"," I'd have to agree. My ex lived 20+ miles outside of central London, in a 400 sf 1-bedroom, 1-bath attached unit with exactly ZERO closets and one window. Not even a coat or small linen closet. It sold for ?214,000 ten years ago - that was around $300,000 US. I know other residents who lived further out who had homes/mortgages at a similar level. Everything else is also pretty expensive - a lot of income goes to just the basics in many households.re: Cars - a lot of positions over there come with company cars or a company-provided vehicle allowance. That may account for *some* of the higher-end cars, as the allowance has to be used for a vehicle and is use-it-or-lose-it. "

"fedlawman","February 2012"," Thanks flightnurse...There doesn't appear to be any suspension or driveline damage, but both bumpers were ripped off, and both front fenders were pushed back and up into the A-pillars. The oil cooler is bent out of shape. We didn't see any evidence of frame damage, but the glove box doesn't close properly anymore, leading me to suspect more unseen damage. There are numerous light paint scratches all over the passenger side of the car. I haven't driven it, but the engine runs, there are no new leaks, and the rear wheels are still attached to the crank, so that's something.Most of the expense from the bodyshop estimate is because they would replace body panels and have to paint the entire car to get a good blend. Do a four-wheel alignment and then insurance added $2500 for additional unseen work that is expected to be needed. Total estimate to repair is $15K - $17.5K.I'm considering buying the Salvage and piecing it back together myself. USAA wants $4200 for it and I'm sure I could fix it for a lot less by bending things back into position, buying bumpers online and having MAACO paint them, etc...Part of me knows it will never be the same and I'll think of my brother whenever I drive it. Maybe I'll just buy the salvage, part it out, and move on. I really don't know what I'm going to do yet. "

"qbrozen","February 2012"," Kind of does sound like the unibody is bent. Did you have this insured through standard insurance? Or on classic insurance with an ""agreed upon value?"" If standard insurance, I would add some of those in the back of Roundel as comps. I saw a couple in the most recent edition that were something like $25k-$30k, IIRC. "
"fedlawman","February 2012"," It is a ""cash value"" coverage. I didn't have the option for ""agreed value"" with USAA. I did look into Classic insurance when I got the car, but at the time, I believe it was too new still and there were limitations imposed on how I use the car that didn't work for me at the time. I should have revisited it more recently, but I didn't get around to it. My fault, for sure...Good advice about the Roundel classifieds. I have printed out a bunch of comps I have found online, but not from the Roundel.Thanks. "
"qbrozen","February 2012"," well, just an FYI in case you fix it or buy another classic, things apparently are a bit different now. Back in the summer, we bought a 300E for the wife. I too was worried about the perceived limitations on a Hagerty policy (for example), so I shopped around. Found another company that offers classic ""agree upon value"" coverage but also lets you choose a more liberal policy where you can drive the car for pleasure use up to a total of 7500 miles per year. So I bought that. (Wish I could remember the name off the top of my head, but I know I posted it on the Project Cars discussion.)Not long after, Hagerty was bugging me for some feedback. I wrote on the form how I didn't like their restrictive policies. A rep called me after that to talk about it. He said they will cover for pleasure use and not just ""to and from car shows."" Which is good because I still have my MR2 covered by them. So, anyway, there are options out there for you.Good luck with this one. Anxious to hear a good outcome. "
"fedlawman","February 2012"," Thank you for the info, that's really good to know. I may yet benefit from it in the near future.I'll definitely let you know how everything ends up. "
"graphicguy","February 2012"," FED....as others said, glad to hear you and your BIL are OK.I don't envy you regarding dealing with the insurance companies. It's always a crap shoot whether they will actually do what's right by their customers (regardless of what their TV ads claim). Hope they do....best of luck!Regarding the 4 cyl lux cars, I don't like them. They are not as smooth as their 6 cyl counterparts. The 328i I drove was down on performance vs the 6 cyl 328i I test drove last year. And, it's not nearly as smooth. Yet, it costs more. Go figure.BMW does have an outlet for their 4 cyl cars.......it's called MINI.It's no secret that I like well performing cars. That's the reason I like the TL SH AWD, the 335i, the Taurus SHO, etc (all of them were on my shopping list last go round).I pretty quickly dismissed the Audis and MB (a C series, even with a 6 cyl, but down on power) for that very reason.Call me whatever name you want. But, I put power before fuel economy....every time.We'll see where the whole 4 cyl thing ends up for BMW. Haven't driven a 5 series in awhile. But, the trade rags I've read aren't too enamored with it using the 4 cyl.BTW....my local dealer had an '11 535 GT in the showroom, loaded, MSRP well north of $60K. It had ~1,100 miles on it, used by the sales manager.They had a price on the windshield of $49,999. If I were in the market......?????!!!!!! "
"sweendogy","February 2012"," Yep, I also look at ""leader adds"" while drive as well "
"sweendogy","February 2012"," While I agree with you on power, I think it's very important as well, but the examples of Taurus Sho and Tl might be a bit of a stretch . Both are very heavy and are middle of the pack overall performers- that are based on family FWd platforms, and I'm sure you did your research but and the car rags agree. - sales numbers also point to the fact they are mid level players at best.That being said the 535 is a fantastic example where just Enuf power plus performance doesn't warrent the bigger engine. Here's a review of the new 3, they did mention the engine was a little different but has more power.http://m.caranddriver.com/review.rbml?id=440313&full=trueI think we have turned the page -4cyls arethe new Elpps, atleast the ones that produce torque and hps. "
"nyccarguy","February 2012"," I'll be curious too as to how well received the new 4cyl is by the non-enthusiast crowd. My dentist is picking up a 2012 Audi Q5 3.2 next week. He drove it back to back with the 2.0T and really preferred the way the 3.2 behaved. He's not an enthusiast, just likes European cars. There used to be a ""4 cylinder stigma"" that I don't know exists anymore in certain circles. Fuel economy is on everyone's mind these days (and has been for quite some time now). I always enjoy a good car conversation outside of my enthusiast friends. People used to talk about acceleration & horsepower. Now the first question you hear someone ask when someone else gets a new car is: ""How is it on gas?""I wonder what kind of crazy incentives BMW will offer on the E90 335 & 328 xi before the new F30 Xi models come out. Cash? Low financing? "
"btc33","February 2012"," I make around $46,000 a year and am looking to buy a entry level luxury car for around $18,000. I am not a fan of Camrys, Accords, etc. I am just wanting to make sure I get a car I can afford the maintenance costs and and one that is not going to have issues a lot. I know I can afford to buy one but I just want to make sure I can afford to own one. "
"dino001","February 2012"," I assume you want a used car - and it has to be quite used (4+ years old). I own BMW myself, but bought it new with maintenance. I love, but would not get one for 18 grand, especially if did not have more money to spend after the purchase. If maintenance costs are real issue for you, start with Acura TSX or TL. TL is definitely more luxurious, but more expensive and larger; you'd get newer TSX. TSX is smaller, but also more agile and better on gas. TL is basically luxury version on Accord. TSX is a top line of European/JDM car also called Honda Accord, but it's a different vehicle altogether.My second choice for low maintenance entry level/semi luxury would be 2005-2010 Subaru Legacy GT or 3.6R (the last letters are important - it's a turbo version or 6-cylinder of Legacy, respectively). GT is very fast and has 6-speed manual transmission (if that's important to you), not so great on gas and may be hard to find. Legacy 3.6R Limited has a smooth 6-cylinder engine and AT and also decent level of equipment. Third choice - Infiniti G35. For 18 grand, it may already be too old to be ""problem free"". "
"sweendogy","February 2012"," I will be less rude ""I bought a BMW new but would never get one for 18k"", Ok well how about a lease. _ Acura, Infiniti, BMW and others offer competitive leases that for that same 18k over 3 years you can get into a Elpps car. On his Infiniti comment I have a 07 g35x with 30k miles - it can be had for 20k but in this economy would consider 18k- no problems, new stopers but does need tires. so In conclusion I think you can find a car - not cerified for 18k, year 2007 or better that will satisfy your needs. - "
"ivan_99","February 2012"," You could get an 06 IS350 if you don't mind an automatic. It is basically the same as the new 2012.You'd have HP that was tops in 06 and is still competitive today and you'd have the ""Lexus"" reliability...if you subscribe to that sort of thing... "
"graphicguy","February 2012"," btc....I don't know your personal finance situation (married? house payment? credit card bills?, etc), but would be willing to state that if an unexpected car repair comes up, you would be hard pressed to cover it.With that in mind, I think I would probably stay away from the lux brands. Even though Acuras, Lexus, etc are known for their reliability, they do break. And, they do cost more than their more plebeian Honda and Toyota counter parts.Don't discount Ford or GM either. You would be able to pick up a new Focus or Cruze for that amount with warranty, and probably better performance than older lux cars.You could probably pick up a nice, 2-3 year old Camry or Accord for that money, and be relatively assured you'd get a lot of trouble free miles out of them.Audi, BMW, etc, while good cars, are not economical to maintain, even if nothing major does go wrong with them. Unless you can do it yourself, even routine maintenance items will be expensive.In short, set your sights lower, until you get more established into a higher tax bracket.Good luck! "
"dino001","February 2012"," Well, didn't mean to. All I was saying, if 18 grand was all I had and I had no apetite for above-average repair/maintenance, I would not buy a car I currently own, even though I absolutely love it. Trying to be a realist. It is actually very easy to buy something, but to own it is a different story. "
"qbrozen","February 2012"," S60 2.5T FWD. ONLY that model. Do NOT get AWD in this car! And it has to be '07 or newer for better transmission reliability (unless you are getting a stick, in which case it doesn't matter).I also endorse the G35. Or you could get a Maxima. "
"flightnurse","February 2012"," Sweeny you and leases.... Leases are not for everybody and most of the time cost more in the long run then buying a car. To get those ultra low payments come mileage restriction which is you are not careful can add up to thousands of dollars at the end of your lease. Most ultra low leases have a cap of 30K for 3 yrs. "
"flightnurse","February 2012"," 18K can get you some nice cars, however they will not be new, and I would avoid a lease at all cost. What cars appeal to you? also do not forget to add the cost of insurance, once you step up to the lux brands, Infiniti, Audi, BMW, Acrua, lexus, insurance goes up too. One thing you need to remember is, just because it comes from Japan doesn't mean the cost of maintenance will be less then those from Germany. The same can be said for cars from the US. Most of us can give you some advice or tell you the pros and cons of certain brands over others most of is can very objective too. "
"sweendogy","February 2012"," Leases allow you to get more far with the least amt of money- I was throwing the option of leasing to our new contributor. I own 2 cars but have leased in the past when I was less liquid so i think it's a good option. Please spare us with the leader add spew, over have the 3 series sold are leased. "
"dino001","February 2012"," Leases allow you to get more far with the least amt of money- I was throwing the option of leasing to our new contributorNo, they don't. They allow you to think you are getting a better car for less money, just because you are paying less per month. Long term lease can be very, very expensive, if you don't know how to lease. ""Low payment"" lease is great to park the car and look at it - just not drive it. Yeah - then it is ""cheaper"". But when you actually need to get anywhere with your car, the ""cheap"" lease bites.I'm with the nurse of this - leases are NOT for ""beginners"". You need to educate yourself before you go there, otherwise they'll skin you alive. You need to know exactly how many miles you need, what depreciation, residual, money factor are, how to calculate lease, what are traps, why big downpayment is a bad idea, etc. And boy, at less than 50 grand a year you have no business even coming to a new car lot at lux brand dealership. I know it's harsh, but that's the reality. Our country is in its current trouble exactly because people think they could get a half milion house on 50 grand. Same applies to cars. You get it when you can afford it, not sooner. "
"sweendogy","February 2012"," For 400 bux a month - you can get a Acura tsx-yea it's 10k miles a year - but again it's an option for some. A long term lease =what? 3 years are the avg lease deals. So for 14400 you can get a tsx for 3 years. The point is this may be an option - you need to educate for sure before doing it - just like when you buy a car you should - or sailing a boat. Pretty sure you and nurse - are one and the same when it comes to hateing leasing , which is fine but it is an option for some. No money or little down, smaller payment, works for some. Look at all those 3 series rolling around - you think most are paying cash, financing or leasing those puppies. I'm sure a good % of those people don't make this big bux like you and nurse. "
"dino001","February 2012"," By ""long term lease is expensive"" I didn't mean a long lease term, I meant that in the long run leasing costs more, as in after three years you need another one, and then another one, which adds up to total cost higher than buying a car and keeping it (leasing new cars means you absorb steepest portion of the depreciation every time you do it). I don't hate leases, not at all. I think their fine for people who know what they're doing. In fact, for some brands and models, lease is better than buying as long as you get the right mileage. Manufacturers sometimes subsidize leases more than they do purchases (by e.g. inflating residuals and/or use money factors below market rates), which makes them more attractive, even with larger fees (e.g. $800 acquisition fee translates to over half percentage point in a loan). In a sense, when you get inflated residual on a lease, you buy then a smaller portion of a vehicle than you should (the rest is picked up the manufacturer). If market residual value is 42%, but the lease says it is 52%, then you get discount eual to 10% of MSRP, even before you negotiate the price (usually it is not as drastic). The fees (acquisition and disposal) will take some of that back, but if money factor is also low then it could be a winner. My issue is that a lot of people don't understand all aspects of leasing, don't understand true costs of leasing that goes beyond monthly payment, but do it anyway and then get burned. Just because something is less per month, doens't mean it's cheaper. "
"dino001","February 2012"," So for 14400 (10k miles a year ) you can get a tsx for 3 years. Then drive to your friend's house, show it to them, then go to the park, snap a few pictures in a nice scenery, then you park it in your garage and take a bus to work. I rest my case. "
"sweendogy","February 2012"," Well said, I have a 07 g35x which I bought new and has 30k miles - have some good fun snapping pixs in a car I own- and the 3 year lease at 10k a year would have fit me well. So what's your point ? You can Taylor a lease to meet your millage needs, most of these cars have excellent residual values after 3 years I'm sure the extra 2k miles won't cost that much per month. You rest your case- ok great. Point is may people who can't throw down 20-30-50k for a car can actually get the car they want. Sure they pay for depeshiation - but so do hey people who buy cars as well. Can't wait for flightnurse response - ""leader adds, I got a BMW with m sport for 10k under sticker, lease would of cost me 15k more over 4 years, experimental dealer sale, blabble."" "
"flightnurse","February 2012"," Sweeny please do not put words in my mouth. For the record I like leases and for only certain people. I'll give you an example, my sister doesn't drive much, she wants a new car every few years, she can afford the payments. She leased a new CTS last year, got a great deal. $800 out of pocket and $499/m for 3 years, she gets 10K a year for mileage, however she doesn't drive much, about 8K year, so a lease was perfect for her.A lease is not good for someone young because 1) the mileage restriction on leases (however you can negotiate increase mileage into lease payments.) 2) leasing its for everybody. "
"flightnurse","February 2012"," Sweeny you have a real problem, my BMW was not a ad leader, most ad leaders are stripped down cars, just like the G37 that is advertised this past weekend in Phoenix, two infiniti dealers (btw owned by the same company) had a G37 Journey for $34K or $299/m with $4500 down and 10K/yr mileage. "
"sweendogy","February 2012"," I love when you say leader add, or ad leader it's great.- all the examples I Have used on leases are from company websites- no where else, not dealers or anything from a local news paper, no local dealers, the actual companies deals. Let's end the leader add agrument as we have proved you are really keen on pointing out. No one said your BMW 328 m package or your 535 that your partner just ordered is a leader ad, but some here have questioned your experimental dealer story you told, I Have not mentioned it was a leader ad situation, so I don't see my problem. I have questioned why you and Dino are quick to shut down leases - when infact the company you bought a car from leases 50% of those same cars.Again your sisters story, while long, is a great example of a lease that worked for the user- and I was pointing out to the new poster this might be a way to go. It's a situational thing, some people cant afford to buy a new car every 3 years but can afford to lease those same cars. "
"tlong","February 2012"," Leases allow you to get more far with the least amt of money Per MONTH. Leases in the long run tend to be more expensive. For those who can deduct (business owners) or those who want new wheels every 3 years, leases MIGHT make sense. For those who keep their wheels a bit longer or want the lowest overall cost, leases make no sense at all. "
"nyccarguy","February 2012"," Flightnurse hit the nail right on the head. Too many people use leasing as a way to get a cheap payment on a more expensive vehicle. So many people DO NOT understand leasing, but do it using a big capitalized cost reduction & paying the taxes up front (both big no-nos) in order to get a less expensive car payment. Notice I didn't say cheap.Leasing is more expensive in the long run absolutely. Some lease for business purposes. I can tell you 1st hand that my accountant said it is easier to ""write off"" a monthly lease payment than it is to depreciate the value of a vehicle on a yearly basis.Pretty much all of the ELLPS leases I see advertised in the paper are for 10K per year. There's even a Mercedes Dealer that if you read the fine print gives a whopping 7500 miles per year. A lot of people do take these 10K per year leases & go over, but there are people who like to lease a nice new car every 3 years to drive back & forth to the train station.Kyfdx once perfectly said ""leasing should be looked at as an alternate way of financing."". So true. If you can afford to pay cash or the 60 month car payment on whatever ELLPS you like, but an inflated residual or super cheap money factor that makes your payment a lot less expensive and you can live within the mileage limitations, than go for it. "
"flightnurse","February 2012"," Sweeny, first off for the car to be ""considered"" a leader car it has to be advertise, my 328 was not advertised. Second, we haven't ordered our 535, again not a leader car, not too sure how a car that hasn't been built is a leader? Explain that one.... BTW, Audi has a great lease on a A8, $8500 down and payment of $1199/m I didn't catch the mileage restriction, figured you like to know that. "
"sweendogy","February 2012"," I'm out on this conversation - here is what I learned- a lease is not for everyone, but could fit some, but be smart about it. No one understands leader adds more then flightnurse, in fact I think he might have created the ter along with ""experimental car sale."" guy asks for options about how he can get into the ELLlps- and we get off track. Do you think we will ever hear from that cat again? "

"sweendogy","February 2012"," today in the parking lot i saw a manual 328xi sports wagon with the M sport package-- pretty cool looking rig for a wagon - "
"flightnurse","February 2012"," How does it look differently then a regular wagon? "
"sweendogy","February 2012"," Now I didnot see the front end - but the bar has the cool sports dam underneath the trunk- it also had a body colored rear spoiler - M badge on steering wheel and stick- plus the black was a dark- wonder if was the standard black or the 800 dollar option- i had no idea the wagon could come with the m pack and awd "
"flightnurse","February 2012"," You can get it in a 6 spd manual too. "
"sweendogy","February 2012"," I mentioned that above- I think that's pretty cool. "
"nkeen","February 2012"," I drove an F30 328i last weekend - a Sportline with 8 speed auto. My current car is a 2006 E90 325i with sport suspension and 6 speed manual. Thoughts:1) The steering is lighter but also feels oddly disconnected on the new car -- it has lost that firm directness I like on the E90.2) The N20 four banger is powerful but has some lag. Not as sweet as the less powerful unboosted six.3) The sports seats in my car can seem like instruments of torture at times. The new ones are no better -- two pointy things jutting into my kidneys. Why can't BMW get this right? VW does in the GTI.4) Although the base pricing is not much more higher than the E90, getting the options I want means buying a lot of superfluous stuff that I don't (for instance a $3,600 package to get HID headlights), so the car ends up being a lot more expensive.I drove a Camaro SS manual with Hurst shifter and FE4 suspension and a Subaru WRX on the same day as the F30. Both, in their respective ways, were much more fun to drive -- the WRX was a thrill to toss around and had real character. I'm afraid that BMW might be losing the plot for the sake of the see-and-be-seen audience in the US and anticipated sales volume in China. "
"nyccarguy","February 2012"," We see it is very easy to push the price of an F30 328i to $45,000 +. The enthusiast in all of us needs to consider that for the same $45K, you can find yourself a CPO (or just plain used) 2008 M3 Sedan. "
"nkeen","February 2012"," There was a 328i Modern Line on the floor listing for over $50K. "
"nyccarguy","February 2012"," Thanks for your F30 328i write up. How many miles have you racked up on your E90 325i? Have you had any problems with it? How come you are looking at the F30? "
"nkeen","February 2012"," Low mileage -- 48,000. One problem -- the thermostat failed around 20K -- I guess causing it to run cold, but no symptoms -- found during inspection at the dealership. I also had the dealer replace the driver's seat under warranty as a crease in the leatherette was starting to show fabric webbing. The first round of run-flats were a bit brick like, but the technology seems to have improved a lot with the newer tires (Bridgestone RE050As).Whatever its faults, I've owned the 325i far longer than any other car I've had. It's a beautifully built car, and really still looks close to new. It feels as though it were made to be driven fast safely, which it was. I like the original E90 better than its mid-cycle refresh, which seemed to complicate and compromise the lines a bit. Its predecessors were an Acura TL and a GTI. I started to dislike the TL almost as soon as I had it -- good engine, but clearly not engineered by people who really understood handling and feel. Horrible clutch and steering. I liked the Brazilian built GTI to drive, but it just fell apart piece by piece (transmission, trim, you name it) -- perceived rather than real quality. "
"dino001","February 2012"," I have one, including the stick shift. :P Slightly different in options: 328i (no ""x"", it is RWD) and it doesn't have M-pack (regular sports pkg for RWD already has sporst suspension and staggered tires, just like M, the difference is in wheels (17"" vs 18"") and some aesthetic treats, like no badging and front grille). It also has the rear spoiler. The long sunroof is the coolest. Most people are surprised how sporty it looks. Deep see blue, just like the one on the photo (or is that one Le Mans blue, which is available only on M-packs?). I smile every time open the door and sit inside... "
"flightnurse","February 2012"," The HID headlights are a standalone options for $900. Take look at BMW's web site. The steering can be fixed with the M steering option, however if you wait until July when the M sport package is available that will solve the problems. Before flying out to New York my partner and I stopped off at Chandler BMW, they have two F30's a fully loaded Sportline 335i 57K and a Modern for 48K. Before I give judgement I want to drive one with the M sport package, since my 2011 has that package. Of course the big push the salesman kept telling us was, you have more power and better fuel economy with the new engine. "
"dino001","February 2012"," All of this confirms to me never buy a ""all-new"" model in its first or even second year. Dealers will act like they're doing you a favor, manufacturers act like it's a such a breakthrough that it overshadows Moon landing, you have teething issues and the list goes on. Couple of years from now and silly options/packages either disapear or get more reasonable pricing. Base model usually costs about the same, or even more by a couple of hundreds, but more popular/valuable options get bundled in much more attractive packages. No more expensive wheels forced down your throat if you want a certain color. Certain thing also become standard of no cost options. This way you can get a $50K+ MSRP down by a few thousands. Best deals are usually mid-life ""refreshed"" models. Bugs worked out, aesthetics, improved and couple of things made standard. "
"sweendogy","February 2012"," i agree- just hearing 57k for a loaded 335 is unreal- the 335xi will be 60k- for a ELLPS- thats a joke- its a great car, dont get me wrong but at that cost you can buy a street in detroit these days. "
"nyccarguy","February 2012"," Ive tried to ""build my own"" 328i on BMW's website. It will not allow you to choose the Xenon headlight option without checking off the $3600 Premium Package.If you drive the F30 328i M Sport & love it, you'd consider trading in your way cool M Sport Equipped '11 328i (6 Speed Stick) already? "
"lemmer","February 2012"," I started to dislike the TL almost as soon as I had it -- good engine, but clearly not engineered by people who really understood handling and feel. Horrible clutch and steering. To each his own. I find BMW clutches to be pretty mediocre and Acura clutches to be among the best. "
"markcincinnati","February 2012"," Everything I have read about the Acura TL with a manual transmission makes it sound like the reviewer has found heaven behind the wheel. If you are having issues with the feel of your clutch or whatever issue you are having, take it to the dealer -- maybe you really do have an out of whack unit.Regarding the handling, there too, I have found the Acura comparble to the 2009 Audi I had right before I got the 2012 TL SH-AWD Advance. I just wish the thing had Audi seats in it. "
"flightnurse","February 2012"," Regarding the HID lights, I was not aware about the force package, I'm sure once production is geared up and all models are in production things will change.Nope, no trade in for me, we stopped by to talk to the sales guy about the535i or 550i, for 2012 the 550i now gets the 4.4l twin turbo that is in the M5. We drove both cars back to back and my partner really liked the 550i over the 535 you can't get a manual in the 535 but you can get one in 550i he likes that. So just hashing out details. "
"flightnurse","February 2012"," explain what you mean be mediocre? "
"sweendogy","February 2012"," I have never heard a complaint about the Acura clutch or shifter ever--- in fact I miss my 2000 GS-r because it was the nicest manual I have ever driven- I think you should bring it back for a check- I'm sure the Acura dealer has seen probably 2 other tl-s with stick in the past 5 years so dot be surprised I'd they don't know why to do with it. I think the bigger grip with the tL is its size, shape, performance and most of all looks. If this car was 5k less it's a steal- but it's priced against the g and anyone with a car magazine subscription or a pulse would pick the g - 10 out of 10 times. "
"nkeen","February 2012"," Mine was a 2005 TL. The clutch was like an on/off switch. The steering was heavy, with asymmetrical loading left to right (many visits to the dealer to fix this, all unsuccessful). Turning the car on a twisty expressway was like winding and unwinding a heavy spring. The car never settled down in cruise -- always fighting the steering. Great stereo, though, and one of the few cars where the auto a/c was able to hold a comfort level at one temp setting regardless of humidity and sunlight. Brembo front brakes, as the manuals had at that time. I got rid of it after about 18 months. The TSX of around the same vintage was a better if uninspiring car. "
"plekto","February 2012"," The clutch is actually better with a distinct on/off point. But the issue with the steering is because it's a front wheel drive car with manual. There is absolutely no way to fix it or alter the laws of Physics to make it work like a RWD car. The steering is also extremely dead feeling as far as feedback goes so that you get nothing and then tons of torque-steer in corners. (see Buick for this behavior)Add in lower profile tires than it should be fitted with, plus unidirectional tires that fight each other (each side's tread wants to move the tire outwards) and it's a pretty miserable highway cruiser as well (note GM and Toyota have had this issue - the ""fix"" is to switch to non-directional tires)It's a fancy Avalon. No surprise that it sucked as a makeshift sport sedan. "
"nkeen","February 2012"," Perhaps so. There weren't that many changes to the E90 options structure over time, one notable exception being the removal of the sunroof from the standard equipment list on the 328i, a scenario carried over to the F30. The engines were the big midstream changes, to meet the Japanese competition.I'd bet that a lot of thought has gone into the pricing structure in order to maximize the numbers and simplify the production process. Still, in a world where HIDs are now standard on a 2013 Mustang V6.....Speaking of E90s, I think the best auto model to drive, by far, was the 335d. I once drove the 335i and 335d back to back. The diesel packed the wallop of a torquey American V8. The 335i lacked low end grunt and felt fussy be comparison -- I never drove the manual version but I'm sure that it would be much better. "
"nkeen","February 2012"," The clutch is actually better with a distinct on/off point. You need a definite zone of travel where it is engaged and a zone of travel where it is not engaged, but between those you want a zone of clean linear progression for smooth uptake.Regarding the tires, I think it had Turanzas which distorted when parked overnight in the cold and then rumbled away in the morning. The TL seemed cobbled together by some design studio in California based on what focus groups told them constituted a driver's car. And it came close in many areas. I wish the BMW was half as comfortable. Great Honda V6 too. "
"nyccarguy","February 2012"," I drove a (F10) 535 & 550 back to back at a BMW Ultimate Drive event with my Dad. I was impressed with the 535's power delivery. It did a great job merging and I got it up to about 90. It felt great, like it could cruise at that speed for a week.The 550 was a flat out monster. Easily one of the fastest cars I've ever driven. ""Engage the hyper drive chewy."" On the same stretch of highway (Garden State Pakway in NJ right near the NY border), I hit 120 before I backed off. It was awesome. "
"flightnurse","February 2012"," Sweeny did u at one time own a BUICK GN? "
"flightnurse","February 2012"," NYCarguy that is why I call the 2012 550i a M5 light... For a car that is 10K more then a top out 335i, the 550i is a bargain... Now drive with a 6 spd manual.. "
"fedlawman","February 2012"," For those that have driven them, how is the throttle response of the new T-4 vs. the T-6? I really like the 335i but one thing I don't like is the throttle/turbo response. Maybe I'm just OCD about throttle response, but I really prefer a direct link between my right foot and the throttle bodies. While the 335i is better than most turbos I've driven, it's still got that rubber band feeling. "
"flightnurse","February 2012"," Hey Fed the throttle response of the T-4 was fine, of course once the turbo is spooled up you are hard press to know it is a t-4, off the line there is slight turbo lag, but I'm sure the aftermarket companies will fix that. The T-6 is very hard press to know it is a turbo even off the line. But there are a couple of aftermarket companies that can make the t-6 a true screamer with very little money... Also to note, the t-4 cars has a switch that can program the DME to adjust the throttle response for sport to Econ to Comfort. "
"nkeen","February 2012"," The delay in the 328i T4 is brief at worst, but it is sometimes apparent when you get on it. "
"sweendogy","February 2012"," No before my time but a true American classic. "
"nyccarguy","February 2012"," Any update on your E30 M3? "
"nyccarguy","February 2012"," OK, an F30 in either 328i or 335i guise is out of my price range at close to $50K. But let's see if my calculations are correct, in 2015 my current 2010 TSX (purchased in August 2009) will have 100,000K on it and maybe I'll be itching for a replacement vehicle. These F30s will just becoming off lease...hmmm. "
"joshuah1","February 2012"," I am looking at the Infiniti G and the Acura TL. Either way I would get AWD. I like the G but that body style has been around for years and is due for major refresh in 2013. I don't want to get a car that looks ""old"" in one year. The TL is very aggressive and recently refreshed but not attractive (subjective) from all angles. The G is much faster 0-60 if you get automatic...basically the same with manual. There are many other factors to consider but performance and exterior are really important to me. Opinions? "
"sweendogy","February 2012"," I've made it know for years what I feel on these 2 rigs. If you want a better looking, better performer it's the G. More refinements, quiet it's the TL . I think sales numbers and the car mags have made it clear the G is the true wInner. "
"flightnurse","February 2012"," It is only a winner if you do not put the 3 series in the mix. Infiniti has come close to beating the 3 series in comparison test but haven't done it yet. I'm sure in the next few months there will be a comparison test so only time will tell. "
"sweendogy","February 2012"," while you might be right its not what the poster asked. I think for the price of a stripped down 328 you can get a g37, as we mentioned before the 328 gets very pricy with options unless you have a ""experimental"" deal like you did. Im sure the 328 motor in your rig performs very well, the new turbo 4 even better so i think the trend will continue as infiniti plays second fiddle in this category on total package- BUT price is something to consider-- and i love saving money. The 335 while an absolute animal - now closing in on 60k, sorry thats a huge step in price from 42k-44k maxed out G. "
"flightnurse","February 2012"," Sweeny until the magazines and experts say other wise, the 3 series is better car then the TL and G. When you responded to the OP (original poster) you need to clarify what you were writing. BTW, how old are you again?BTW BMW of Bayside is having an excellent sale on their loaner 2011 BMW, my cousin just picked up a 2011 335iXdrive with M package, Premium Package, and Nav for $37K. It has hail damage and is not CPO car, but with only 11K miles on it it has the remaining factory warranty. It drives great, BTW, long island needs to fix their street though, the pot holes here are horrible and I thought Calif was bad... "
"plekto","February 2012"," If you go back to the three vehicles that started this entire segment, you'll see a pattern.- BMW 3 Series (Now also includes the 1 series)- Mercedes C Class (C class still fits here)- Volvo 200 series (S60 would be the modern version I guess)Now, times and technology have changed, but the thing that these had in common were that they were smaller versions of the larger luxury sedans and still had a bit of sportiness in them. Over time, other manufacturers added competing products, but now it seems as if everything with some leather added is now part of this group.The TL is basically a Honda Lucerne. It's a big and heavy boat with luxury touches added. See the Toyota Avalon for a similar vehicle. It simply doesn't belong in this class of vehicles. Go drive a Mercedes or BMW and see what I mean - there's a massive difference. "
"sweendogy","February 2012"," Again I agree the car experts do pick the 3 over the g - which is why again I said the G plays the second fiddle - When I responded to the OP- it was in direct response to his question, which was also in the title of your confrontational responses, so I don't need to clarify.I've never been asked my age on here - I'm 35 Dk what that has to do with anything? Will check out bayside BMW - M package xdrive 6speed 2010-11 on my wish list.Long island a bit far from here but I would go to save a grand or 2 "
"m6user","February 2012"," BMWs used to be the cars that all other sports sedans were measured up to. They now are totally overrated in comparison to other makes that have made great strides over the years. The magazines and so called ""experts"" think it is sacriledge to admit that BMW is not what is once was and that other makes are just as good or better. The magazine reviewers do nothing but repeat themselves and each other and then the people that put so much faith in them repeat their junk further. The BMW lemmings have drank the kool aid so much that they don't even look outside the BMW brand. It's almost like a cult religion.Compared to the G the BMW costs more, isn't nearly as fast(unless you get the 335 for another $10k), in the X models gets about the same mpg as a car with 100 more HP, has a shorter warranty, leather is in upgrade, dash looks like something from the 90s, comes with 16"" wheels standard, trunk space of an econocar and the list goes on. Oh yeah, better not keep one more than a standard lease period if you buy cause the repairs will come and they will be expensive. "
"dino001","February 2012"," Then don't buy it. It's a free country, you can say what you want and I can freely get ripped off. To each their own. No need for aggression or name calling - completely uncalled for. I bought one after very extensive investigation, what's out there and definitely will not blindly go again. I always check others.I actually agree to some of your points regarding levels of equipment or some design cues (I also think the dash is ridiculously low grade and leather or fold-down seats should be standard), but ... trunk size? Really? What else? Back seat too small for you? Suspension too stiff? What an outrage, I need a premium fuel? Warranty? Wow, Infiniti gives you 10k miles more on b-t-b and one year more on powertrain... big deal. BMW gives you maintenance. Let's call it a wash. I really don't undestand the need of validating your own preferences and choices by berating others. :sick: "
"sweendogy","February 2012"," down dino-- wow- i dont think m6 was calling you out directly-- name calling, didnt really see that.. what i did see was an opinion on the car-- I think he made some valid pts when he talked bout 10k difference in price among others -- trunk space i agree a stretch. - lets be honest the ""free"" maintenance thing is something all bmw owners use as a crutch..""BMW claims to have calculated the average maintenance cost of owning other cars for the same amount of time, ranging from $385 for a Saab to $1,112 for a Jaguar. "" heres is a link we all should look at if this is the dealmaker/breaker http://editorial.autos.msn.com/article.aspx?cp-documentid=1088569love the use of the words outrage, and berating others.. powerful "
"m6user","February 2012"," Please don't take things on here so personally. I just made a list off the top of my head and didn't think I needed to be totally comprehensvie to make a point. And that is what I was trying to make.....a point and it wasn't meant as an insult. You know there are a lot of people out there that buy BMWs based solely on perceived status and from what they are told by so called experts. I assume that those that frequent these forums regularly have a good understanding of what they are getting in a car. Oh, btw, the G powertrain warranty is two years longer and more miles as well. Just trying to get the facts straight. "
"joshuah1","February 2012"," it helps if people answer the question asked. i asked for a comparison between the acura tl and the infiniti g37. i am not interested in the 328i so no need to promote it. i love performance but i also look at the value equation. BMWs are totally overpriced in my opinion, but if the market supports it so be it. I am into handling and 0-60 and if you go with a manual TL or G no 328 comes close. A 335 will but you're now looking at $55k for the same level of equipment. So anybody else who has driven these two vehicles (G or TL) I'd love to hear your comments. Surprised that nobody is sticking up for the TL SH-AWD...I've read their AWD system compares favoribly to the S4's (Audi is also overpriced). I would consider a c350 if they brought back the AWD but you have to go down to the slow C300 for AWD in the C class. "
"dino001","February 2012"," I usually don't mind a little heat, can crank it myself at times. Opinions about issues generally don't get me worked up and I have no problem with people thinking BMW (or anything else) is an overpriced blank of blank, even if I think otherwise. That's to me within acceptable opinion difference range. It was the lemmings part that ticked me off a little. I'm cool now.I rechecked the warranty - yes, I got my math wrong. It is 6y/70K and 4y/60K b-t-b powertrain Infiniti vs 4y/50K b-t-b BMW. It is significant, so is the maintenance. To me it's about equal value, but one may prefer one vs. the other. "
"sweendogy","February 2012"," significant data about the maintenance crutch..the following was taken from BMW of Bayside website. (thanks flightnurse)IntelliChoice DataBMW has compiled data pertaining to the average cost* of maintaining other vehicles during the first four years of ownership. See how BMW's no-cost Ultimate Service plan compares:Brand Maintenance CostsAcura $970.75Audi $967.17BMW $0Cadillac $744.26Infiniti $649.40Jaguar $1112.53Land Rover $233.52Lexus $974.22Lincoln $922.14Mercedes-Benz $1086.60Porsche $1032.14Saab $385.29Volvo $918.93i agree about equal value-- but numbers tell the story "
"fedlawman","February 2012"," ""it helps if people answer the question asked. i asked for a comparison between the acura tl and the infiniti g37.""I think Sweeny answered your question.The G is sportier and most people think it's better looking. The TL is more refined and some people think it's better looking. "
"dino001","February 2012"," Acura has probably more value, defined as features for a price. They have ""everything is standard"" approach and it usually is one option/package. I like that, but it also has its limits. Infiniti is going to be faster, but some options can also add to the price. Acura can be had with manual and AWD combined, which is a big plus to me. To me a choice would be manual RWD Infiniti and AWD Acura, also with a stick. I hate that nose on Acura, but looks to me is something one can get used to. I'm more interested in interiors. Final decision would probably be based on availability, price of target configurations and actual test drive results. "
"sweendogy","February 2012"," dont know about the value comment-- i just maxed out options packages for both cars-- and its $45,970 vs $46,195 maxed out-(using each company websites)- with the infiniti being a 2 hundo extra--not that i would equip as such.... the manual trans with the 6 speed was a big deal for me when i was looking-- i didnot want or justify the extra 10k for the bmw, the acura while having the best shifter i have ever driven looked dumpy.. both the tl and G handle real well- the G is a little louder -and a little quicker- both have very nice interiors and both are great highway cruisers-- the TL has many buttons -- the G is a little simpler but both are very nice on the inside. Being from the North east I didnot want to live without the AWD-- and thought the G at the time was the better car with it being RWD bais and having the breed of cars like the old G, the Nissan Z and GTR under the same stable vs the Honda accord, TSX underpinnings of the TL. I am dissapointed I still cannot get the G with a 6speed and AWD- if someone goes that route with the TL i would understand even given its looks. "
"dino001","February 2012"," It's unfortunately this market. It's only BMW that has it available on all 3-series body styles, engines, drive types. Everybody else always knows better what's good for you. You end up getting manual only on one engine, one type of drive, often even not on all trims. Doesn't matter, Acura (TSX wagon only auto), Infiniti, Lexus, Benz, Audi, Cadillac. Everybody, but BMW limits the availability. "
"sweendogy","February 2012"," i agree the market and bmw does do a great job at that- - (but how about a 328x,335x manual convertible?) - Looks like audi dropped the manual for the base a5 convert and a4 wagon....I would bet its because few people actually look for the manual option any more and it wound not surprise me if bmw goes to retiring the option as well-- chatter was they were not going to bring a manual M5 to the states but backlash from the passionate made it happen..but lets not forget bmw also offers free wipers and oil changes on your new rig as well for the first 4 years. "
"nyccarguy","February 2012"," My question to the OP: are you buying or leasing?The G37x is an absolute road rocket. It is very balanced & turns almost like there's an axis underneath the car. Dynamically, it's a RWD chassis so it's going to be the better performer.The TL is going to be a better ride. Not Buick-like as some suggest, but very refined. From what I've read from magazines & other TH posters, the SH-AWD really transforms the handling characteristics of an otherwise FWD, nose heavy, luxury sedan. It's not as fast as the ag, but it's no slouch.Good luck & keep us informed. Test drives, buying experience. "
"flightnurse","February 2012"," In some sense I agree with you completely on the overrated thing, however BMW is really the only game in town that allows you to tailor the car to your liking. To offer a front engine, rear wheel drive, manual car with a good sport or an excellent (M) sports package. It is the only manufacture that has a sport package on all of its cars, even the mighty 740i. MB and Audi tried to keep up with BMW and lost, I give it Audi that they build a well built car, but it doesn't have the sportiness that the BMW has. "
"nyccarguy","February 2012"," My 2010 Acura TSX is far from perfect, but it is mine, or at least it will be all mine once the loan is paid off in a few years, but I digress. I'm trying to teach myself how to really drive it. Dynamically it drives very differently from my Prelude. With the Prelude, I just basically point the wheel where I want it to go & hit the gas. I usually don't have to brake.With the TSX, I lift off the throttle, stab the brakes, turn the wheel, allow for weight transfer, then jump on the gas.It's no secret that I think the brakes on my TSX are terrible. When the time comes that I need new pads, I'm going to put HAWKS on all 4 corners. I have them on my Prrlude and am happy with their performance. I'll Probably replace the front rotors with brembro oem cross drilled replacements.Once the oem Michelin tires are shot they are going to get replaced with some high performance summer rubber. "
"ivan_99","February 2012"," Surprised that nobody is sticking up for the TL SH-AWDI think the SH-AWD is great. Without switching anything off I was able to slightly over-steer coming out of a corner (if that's your thing). My current car has an esoteric sequence of commands to turn off the 'nannies'...only to be repeated next time it is started.The TL had a great amount of passenger room, nice dash (I don't mind buttons), and was very compliant over bumps, seams, etc. As far as acceleration is concerned it is very similar to all the others; really not that different. Only the 335 felt more lively in day to day driving; felt like all the torque was available 'now'.I like the 'old' beak style as well; didn't purchase one so I guess in a marketing sense it would count as a failure...I ranked it higher than the G37 because it felt more refined and seemed more expensive. I had the first G...the G35 and had a great time with it.I didn't go with a TL because I decided on a CPO IS350 which was more toss-able and had a lower price (than a new TL). It had similar refinement as the TL and is RWD; which isn't as great a benefit as some would argue...especially in the IS which tames much of the sportiness the RWD is supposed to bestow...So, if it were up to me in a TL SH-AWD vs G37 I'd go with the TL. "
"dbledmndk2","February 2012"," I had just gone through this same comparison myself although I also threw the Audi A4 into the mix. I've always been a Honda driver so I figured the Acura TL would be the next logical step. I test drove it 3 or 4 times really wanting to like it, but each time I was just left wanting something more. I personally didn't mind the exterior, but the interior had too many reminders that this really is just an expensive Honda (clunky Nav system, old thin strip digital clock, buttons galore on the console). The car was fast, but it was also pretty heavy and just felt big in my opinion. The SH-AWD kicked in when you accelerated around tight corners, but most of the time you're just in regular FWD. I had my heart set on the A4 - I loved the gas mileage, the refined interior and I actually liked the pickup of the 4 cylinder turbo better than the TL. The only thing I hated was the a la carte option pricing (how the hell can you not offer a trip computer or dual zone climate control or bluetooth in a standard trim) and the arrogance of the sales people who wouldn't come down from MSRP. Finally I decided to test drive the G37x and it was just the perfect balance with plenty of power - felt more powerful than the TL - and a refined interior with all the right options. I could care less about the Nav and the G37 lets you have that easy to use screen with all the functionality, less the $2k Nav. The TL without the Nav looked even more like a Honda and you'd have to rely solely on voice control, which was less than impressive during the test drive. I ultimately decided to lease the G37x as there are some great deals right now with the pending redesign coming for 2013. I've had the car about 2 weeks and am really happy with everything except the MPG, which I knew I'd start to really dislike as soon as I started filling up the tank. I think the Acura TL would be best in the long term as the reliability and resale are unmatched, but my plan is to lease the G37x for 3 years and hope that Acura gets their act together so I can buy something long term when my lease is up. Hope this helps. "
"markcincinnati","February 2012"," I made my comparison for my car in the June - Aug 2011 time frame.Acura TL Advance SH AWD (auto, 6 speed)Audi A4 2.0T Prestige + Sport package (auto, 8 speed)Audi S4 Premium with a couple of options to increase content (auto 7 speed)Audi A6 Premium + with additional options to content it like the TL (auto 8 speed)BMW 335x with Premium, Sport, Nav, Bi-Xenons, +sound upgrade (auto 6 speed)Cadillac CTS/4 3.6 Luxury Edition w/19"" wheels and paddle shifter (auto 6 speed)Infiniti G37X - with every option (auto 7 speed)Infiniti M37X with Premium and Technology (auto 7 speed)Mercedes C class with several of the packages to content it similarly as the A4 or TL (auto 7 speed)Volvo S60 T6 AWD with several packages to get it about to the Audi Prestige or TL Advance level of content (auto 6 speed)I had a lease price number in mind ($600 or less per mo), and I used a service (fee based) called Car Woo to see what the discount off MSRP could be; I also went, in person, to the dealers I test drove and asked for a lease quote at 36 or 39 months 15K miles per year.I bought (leased) the car on September 10.Prior to acquiring the TL, I had narrowed my choices to the cars that offered blind spot warning (BSW) either as part of a package or sold as a separate option.The cars I liked a lot (regardless of BSW):Acura TL (seemed close to an Audi S4 in terms of feel)Audi -- all of themInfiniti M (the G seemed cramped -- I felt like a bug behind the wheel, the thing is so narrow and the hood slopes out of sight, so you can't easily see the front end -- and couldn't be had with BSW)Volvo S60 T6 AWDHonorable mention: Cadillac CTS/4 -- no OMG handles?!? and no BSW, but very American classy and an OK performer -- but not a screamer like the Acura, the Audi S4 or the Volvo S60 T6.Worth noting: the G37X with the sport package did seem a lot of fun -- tons of power, good HUGE paddle shifters and a willingness to go (oddly, rather small wheels and tires, though.)So, if YOU like the power of the Infiniti G and do not feel crammed inside the smallest interior of the bunch (at least it felt that way compared to the Audi and the Acura which at ~72"" wide felt roomy), you should go with the Infiniti -- you are right the Acura is one step away from being ""ugly."" I like the amount of tech in the Acura and the power is strong -- almost, but not quite S4 strong and the torque vectoring gets rid of the Acura TL understeer.On the other hand the new G, next year (?) will probably alleviate some of the size and content issues I had with it.Regarding the pricing -- the Acura TL SH-AWD Advance with backup sensors and splash guards was just south of $48K. I was offered 13% off MSRP. The best off MSRP I could get in person was 8%.I made a financial, performance, luxury (content) decision. Volvo was the worst in terms of an MSRP discount. Infiniti was second best (all from Car Woo, btw.)You can't go wrong with either of your two choices -- but the Acura is not really attractive (when you are on the outside, it is OK when you are on the inside) and the G will be refreshed in about a year (so they say).Purely on performance -- the G. Purely (for me) on affordability and almost the same performance the TL. I think of the S4 everytime I floor the TL or when I am carving into or out of a curve while applying the throttle.Drive it like you live. :surprise: "
"fedlawman","February 2012"," What is it with these dealers? I went to look at cars (BMW's first) over the weekend and honed in on a CPO 2009 335i coupe. It had nice equipment (leather, nav, etc.) and only 17,000 miles on the odo, but they were asking $40,000 (marked down from $45,000!).I know this car was probably $50,000 new, but really, only $10,000 less than a new one? I bet if I asked about leasing a new $50,000 335i it would cost over $600/mo. That would mean a residual value of less than $30,000. So they clean it up and add $2000 profit, and that means a car like this should cost $32,000. And don't even get me started on Porsches. Dealers are asking mid-60's for 2008 C2's! Heh, I saw a 2008 Cayman S - beautiful with only $12,000 miles - and they wanted $50,000 for it. A new one is $60,000...It was a frustrating weekend to say the least.I really think I need to stick with E30s. They're cheap to buy, cheap to maintain, and they don't depreciate. I could buy a cherry 325i convertible for 7 or 8 thousand and be done with it. "
"joshuah1","February 2012"," I appreciate the responses since i last posted. you gave me a lot to think about re the G vs. TL comparison. "
"flightnurse","February 2012"," I wish Audi would do something with their 2 liter engine, it needs more HP then 211 hp, with BMW now having a 240hp turbo 4, Audi needs to increase theirs to the TTS's 256hp if they did that I really think Sweeny complaints that BMW cars are expensive, the base price for the top tier A4 is $44K and it only comes with a turbo 4. "
"ivan_99","February 2012"," The CPO does add value...but I suppose that is up to the purchaser to decide if they want to pay for this 'value'.Did you attempt to negotiate? When I was looking at a CPO 335 coupe they dropped 2k off the MSRP without any real haggling. I'm not certain if that was their absolute bottom (I assume it wasn't).But of course this was a different dealer, time of year, salesman, state, etc, etc...The BMW CPO (I believe) is transferable too, so that is an added benefit as well.I only find ""WOW"" deals when I'm not looking to buy  "
"fedlawman","February 2012"," I was just tire kicking so I didn't try to negotiate.I'm just surprised they price them so high. I know they will negotiate but I just wonder how many people they scare away.Used cars are such a high profit item for dealers because they get the cars at wholesale and mark them up tremendously. Unlike with new cars, buyers are almost completely in the dark as to how much the dealer payed for the car - there's no foundation to stand on for buyers to negotiate. "
"smarty666","February 2012"," So, the G lineup is going to be getting a redesign for the 2013 model year. I was hoping to get some people's thoughts as to what you think Infiniti is going to do to keep the G fresh, innovative, etc. This is especially in light of the new 3-Series with the turbo 4cyl and kick butt mpg. Look forward to hearing the discussion! "
"graphicguy","February 2012"," fedlawman.....was at my BMW dealer last week. They had a '12 328i (loaded up) and a new '12 335i (loaded). They said they were only taking offers of MSRP on both.Interestingly, given that scenario, my '11 335i was about $9K less (discounted) than it's '12 brother. For that large of a delta, the BMW would not have been on my shopping list last year.Sween...you and I don't agree, often. But, I agree with you assessment regarding the value proposition of the recent 328i update. It's entering into territory that other cars really make more sense.Don't get me wrong, there's nothing that drives like a 3, especially with the turbo 3.0. As a side note, there is ZERO lag with mine. But, when the 328i 4 cyl starts creeping toward $50K (loaded) and the 335i creeps towards $60K (loaded), it's time to look at some other vehicles. To me, this is where the G37 starts making more sense.....the price creep of the 3 series puts it there....Infiniti didn't have to do anything.Those of you who've been around here for awhile know of my fondness for the TL. But, I think Acura is going to go in a different direction with the next iteration. I hope they bring out a TL-S before they move on (they usually do). But, I'm not certain they'll be as edgy with the new TL. To me, that would be a real shame.Audis...at least around SW OH, have very little at the dealerships that you can find. I'm seeing more recently. But, stocking levels are still very thin. And, I don't think it's because they sell a ton of them, as they can't if they don't have new stock. Drove an S4. Nice car. Not worth a premium over my 335 nor over an even larger premium over a TL SH-AWD.IMHO, Mercedes C or E class don't even come close to those mentioned above.Gas prices are once again artificially inflated. So, perhaps BMW is putting themselves in a good position with the 4 cyl in the 3 and 5 series. American public is fickle. They'll spend an extra $10K premium to get better MPG that amounts to $3K over the course of a hybrid's life.It's coming....gas prices are due for a monumental crash given that demand had been so tepid (regardless of what people are saying about China and India) and political posturing usually amounts to nothing but noise (how long do you really think Iran can keep from selling oil in Europe). MPG on all vehicles is advancing at a very rapid rate. So, all of this means that a collapse is coming. We'll see how many want a $50K 4 cyl luxury car then. "
"graphicguy","February 2012"," ^^^^^Sorry about that....looks like I started into a free-fall ramble with the above post. I don't get here that often these days.  "
"flightnurse","February 2012"," Fedman it appears that BMW and Porsche's had thier value much better then others. However, if you look at the base price for a new 911, you are talking 80K base... The CPO 335i for 40K seems about right, a fully loaded 335i is almost 60K. You should be able to find a CPO 2009 off lease with less then 40K, which would increase the warranty to 100K for mid to low 20's. "
"flightnurse","February 2012"," Currently Infiniti has the G25 for the entry into the G sedan, which also gets better MPG then the thirsty G37. Right now I don't think a turbo 4 is in the works for Infiniti, however they need to raise their CAFE for get fined. Now since Nissan has some great diesels in Europe and Japan, not too sure why they don't bring these engines over to the US. Regarding design, Infiniti has been on a evolution of their cars, so maybe a refresh would help sales. "
"sweendogy","February 2012"," Yeah Audi needs to bump hp (which I Have mentioned before) but the engine does have a good enuf torque- unlike the tsx ( still in Elpps?) has what 180lbs. I like when you say the base price for a top a4 car- what, what, what...Moving on I agree Audi as also expensive when compared to base level japaniese comps for sure. The tl g give you more for sure- to bad they don't throw in free wipers and oil changes like the great BMW maintaince plan. (iPhone sorry for the mistypes) Flight nurse - why did you need my age again ? "
"dbledmndk2","February 2012"," I think we're going to see a bigger difference between the G25 and the G37. Currently the MPG and price differences are too small in my opinion so I wouldn't be surprised to see the G25 end up with a turbo engine and the G37 to continue on its merry way with a new more sporty exterior and LED daytime running lights. I think there are some pictures floating around out there from a recent auto show hinting at the new G coupe - looks a lot sportier like the Nissan Z. "
"fedlawman","February 2012"," ""You should be able to find a CPO 2009 off lease with less then 40K, which would increase the warranty to 100K for mid to low 20's.""Based on the stickers I saw, I am very sure I cannot get a CPO 2009 335i for less than $30K.Fortunately, I'm not interested in a 335i. After driving it, I didn't like the response of the throttle. It's not turbo lag, per se, but there is definitely a disconnected feeling that I don't like.The only BMW I would consider right now is an E90 M3. I've given myself an upper limit of $60K (but I'd prefer to stay below $50K). I'm in no hurry so I can wait for the right car and deal. "
"smarty666","February 2012"," I was first really interested in the G25 when it came out, but when I saw the mpg rating (which is the same as a RWD G37) for its size engine, it completely turned me off. I hope Infiniti rectifies it. I agree with the Nissan diesels in other countries, why they don't bring them over. I highly doubt they will, especially with the M hybrid, it seems that, at least Infiniti, is going to do a hybrid as their fuel efficient choice of technology. I agree, Infiniti is much like BMW in doing an evolution of their vehicles rather than a revolution, so I expect only a moderate refresh will be done on the G lineup. If they go in the direction of the essence concept, then they should be in good shape design wise. "
"sweendogy","February 2012"," From what I read Nissan and mb are getting together on a 6. Being a Nissan fan I don't know what to expect because from what I'm hearing mb is doing most of the work- should be interesting - I dont think it's going to be ready by 2013 so I don't know of any real update for the G is really in store - atleast what I have read - please share any links detailing the new G "
"smarty666","February 2012"," The G is in its 6th model year, 2007-2012, its due for a redesign. Sales have sagged on the G, and with the new 3 Series, I can't see any logical reason to prolong the redesign into a 7th model year. I don't know of any luxury make bread/butter model, that has gone that long without a moderate-major redesign. "
"ivan_99","March 2012"," The Lexus IS350 is from 2006 and is basically the same for 2012...same engine/transmission.The 2007 G was a G35...it was G37 in 2009.The IS is probably not Lexus' ""bread/butter""...but whatever food group it belongs to, it's starting to smell a bit after so many years.I have an IS and if I were shopping today it probably wouldn't be close to the top of my list. "
"sweendogy","March 2012"," The sales comment and redesign is tht your opinion or fact? If fact from where? Like I said mb and Nissan getting together on a 6 that will be the standard engine for a boatload of cars - I have no read anything on the redesign, which is funny because it's match and Infiniti usually releases new models in oct- "
"graphicguy","March 2012"," Didn't realize the G's current iteration was that ""mature"". But, you're right, it's time for a major upgrade. They've got about as much mileage out of that platform (both the Altima and the G) as they can wring out of it.Same with the IS. I remember looking at an IS350 6 years ago. Wanted to pull the trigger, but the local Lexus dealer acted insulted that I tried to negotiate on it. Now, I'm glad I didn't pull the trigger on one.I can see how the current lux/sport landscape is settling in. On the very top end, you have the BMW 3. On the mid-range, you have the A4/5 and Mercedes C. On the entry range, there's the TL and the G....these are the biggest ""bang for the buck"" in this range.I'm going to watch the next iterations of the TL and the G closely. I've always liked both. "
"smarty666","March 2012"," Fact: The G is in its sixth model year 2007-2012 - your playing with semantics, all that changed between 2008 and 2009 was the 3.7 liter V6 and 7spd transmission. Fact: The G was down 9% for Jan 2012 in sales and just now broke even with YTD in 2011. Fact: The introduction of the G25 did not increase the G's overall sales number in the quantity Infiniti originally hoped for. Fact: The Altima is being redesigned for 2013 With this FACTUAL information, there is a need to introduce a redesign G that is more refined, has much better mpg, etc than the current 2nd Gen G series. Like someone else mentioned, Infiniti has milked its current iteration. They need something fresh to keep nipping on the heels of the 3-Series! Hey, I'm not Infiniti hater, I had an Infiniti at one point, but they need to get their act together to stay competitive. I think this co-op with Mercedes will bring the refinement to the Infiniti line-up that everyone has wanted and complained about for years. I hope they apply this as well and bring a redesigned FX and EX b/c those two crossovers are not helping their sales numbers either. "
"smarty666","March 2012"," I'm not sure how the G is on the lower end of that range considering it is constantly compared against the 3-Series. If anything the 3-Series and G are at the top of the range, with the A4/C-Class in the middle and ES/TL on the lower end of the range. "
"fedlawman","March 2012"," Have you seen pictures (concepts) of the new G? It is fugly!To my eyes, it looks like a Bizzarro World version of the Genesis Coupe.When did the Japanese start copying the Koreans? "
"plekto","March 2012"," The TL isn't in this class at all, though, as it's a large luxury sedan that's similar to a Cadillac or Lexus. It's also front wheel drive, which further complicates the problem.To be entry level and performance, it has to have three things.- Rear wheel drive. If it is AWD, it absolutely has to be rear-wheel biased. (performance part #1)- Be midsize or compact (performance part #2)- Not just a tin can with a bunch of leather added. "
"sweendogy","March 2012"," Fact is you have yet to post any actual information from any source about the redo. You quote sales numbers. The sales figure you quoted, fact says they sold the same Amt of cars ytd as they did in 2011- so they are flat by your estimates. You stated the obvious that they are in the 7th year with the current car, and while I agree they need a refresh I have not seen any word on this coming, but you stated Fact that they are a go for 2013, maybe a spy shot or 2 of Infinitis main seller. I would like to see the press release or a car mag that inFact states this is true- not some comment about the Altima, a car that's for sure the same body style bit 90% of its sales are 4cyl, is fwd, and uses a cvt- 3 major differences when doing a redu. Its great to have an opionion but it's not Fact no matter how many times you write it. "
"smarty666","March 2012"," Everything I stated was fact. Perhaps if you spent less time arguing with people on here about how great Infiniti is, and actually do some research online, you wouldn't have to be so argumentative. BTW - I never said Infiniti confirmed a redesign for 2013, as myself and others have pointed, we said they are in NEED of a redesign as the car is in its sixth model year. Big difference. Nor did I say the car is in its seventh model year. If you do some simple math 2012-2007, that is 6 yrs not 7 yrs. Everything I stated is fact, as is the Altima sharing the same platform as the G Sedan so if the Altima is getting redesign, it makes logical sense that the G would be as well as that is a common occurrence when platforms are shared. "
"qbrozen","March 2012"," so if the Altima is getting redesign, it makes logical sense that the G would be as well as that is a common occurrence when platforms are shared. Not if moving forward with the same platform. The sheetmetal bolted to it isn't shared between the vehicles, so it doesn't matter if one gets redesigned UNLESS it is moving to a new platform.HOWEVER, in this case, you are incorrect anyway, as the G is on the FM platform (RWD/AWD), while the Altima is on the D platform.Speaking of which, the FM platform is already 11 years old. I wish Nissan would either replace it altogether or keep using it just for SUVs. The damned thing results in porky cars. They need something lighter yet more rigid for the Z/G, IMHO. "

Well, let's see that it says on wikipedia: (Note - when I typed in ""Performance Sedan, it pulled up Sports Sedan instead)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_sedanQuote:The term ""sport sedan"" also came into being, when comparing luxury import sedans (i.e. BMW, Audi, and Mercedes-Benz), which were smaller cars popular with young buyers that focused on performance and handling, to domestic luxury marques such as Cadillac and Lincoln, for older customers and which emphasized size and comfort.""A big front wheel drive boat like the TL isn't part of this group, anymore than a Toyota Camry V6 is. And before you go off on me about the TL being on the list on that Wikipedia page, it's referring to the previous generation A-Spec model that was sold in Canada and Japan only. The current model is much larger and more like a fancy Camry than a sports sedan.When I heard the original poster talking about choosing between the TL and a G37, I had to do a double-take.

All I can say is I own a the AWD drive TL and for what its worth, it does a pretty good job in the handling department-have you driven the car? Further more the A-SPEC TL was the heavy FWD car that was pure cosmetic set-up-nothing to do with performance. I owned the 2003 TL Type S and deliberately stayed away from the 2004-2008 models, basically because of the FWD.In my opinion a C300,A4, 328 are just basically overpriced luxury. "
"ivan_99","March 2012"," I agree with you regarding the TL AWD, it handles very well. Unless somebody is a hardcore RWD fanatic I think it belongs in the battle-royal.I think some companies, like Infiniti, walk a tight light between luxury and value.My general feeling is that in a competitive market you can't get something for nothing. Infiniti may have a lower selling price (for a similarly equipped automobile) but IMO it has to come from somewhere...So you may lose in materials, engine refinement, etc. Infiniti is still competitive and the 'mix' of luxury/value still seems to persuade some people to put their hard earned $'s down. And it makes sense, why pay for something you don't want.I see this on my IS350 as well...switches that are shared with 'regular' Toyota's, internal components, etc. I had a G35 and Q45 (at one point) and it was littered with Nissan labels. I'm not certain I would have paid more if these components were all unique to Infiniti. I know my IS is a Toyota...There does seem to be a large overlap between luxury and non-luxury vehicles.The resent surge of Hyundai and KIA initially would give the impression that you're getting something for nothing, but their prices have crept up as well. I think (this surge) it's good for the market to bring the other prices down...In the past few years I haven't seen the ""value"" in Honda's and Toyota'sA few years ago (for some reason) I went through the effort of comparing all the small details between the 3 series (think it was 328) and a fully loaded Camry (they were within a couple $ k's of each other). The Camry was lacking in many areas...don't recall the specifics...something like the ABS used, the chassis construction, suspension design, etc. The difference was substantial enough for me to conclude that the BMW was a ""deal"" I guess what I'm trying to convey in my ramblings is I don't really see true ""luxury"" divisions any more, not for the general car market anyway. A Toyota could be equipped and constructed up to ""Cadillac"" levels. I think this thread is limited in scope to ""try"" to compare vehicles of a much broader group...but for me personally I'd add a VW CC V6 AWD (and others) to this group while loosing some existing participants. "
"graphicguy","March 2012"," nyc...as always, it depends on the deal you can get on the 328. You should be able to do very well, given the new '12s are out. In addition, I'd much prefer the 6 cyl in the '11 over the 4 cyl in the '12. "

"plekto","March 2012"," The main issue that I have with the current generation TL, is while the AWD model does fit the handling and usability model, it utterly fails because it's clearly an entire size/class too large.3948 Lbs for the AWD model without a driver or typical accessories and things (floor mats, tank of fuel, maps and stuff in the glove box, etc...) is just simply too heavy. A typical person will be rolling down the road in one at a whopping 4200lbs. The previous generation S could manage to barely eek into this category with a ~3400lb weight. (though FWD did kind of keep it from being a true contender)And, yes, I did drive one last year. Absolutely underwhelming in turns and the steering was so over-boosted that it felt, quite honestly, a lot like a Buick. And not in a good way, either. The TL is a very very nice car, but it's not a ""sport sedan"" any more than the Lexus ES is. "

"sweendogy","March 2012"," While I agree with Pleko that the (awd) TL is not a great sports sedan and more of a sports cruiser - as 95% of them leave the lot as automatic, and it's weight which I agree with you that the group is getting more bloated. it's no ES which is Buick Camry, the standard TL is also a Buick Es.

"stickguy","March 2012"," He's looking to trade the 2010 Acura TSX, and keep the Prelude forever.What is it with guys here ditching their relatively new Acuras for BMWs? "
"plekto","March 2012"," It's the fact that the new 3 series is a bit too heavy and a bit too isolated from the driving experience. The consensus on the new transmission is that it's not nearly as good as the previous generation model, either. Essentially the 3 series has priced and sized itself out of the market and a lot of people wish they had bought the 1 series instead.Acura has the same problem as well. The current generation models are much larger than their predecessors and while they are nicer looking and feeling inside, they really don't drive any better. In fact, if anything, it's a bit worse for the same sort of reasons as the BMW. Unfortunately, Acura doesn't sell a smaller car than the TSX in the U.S.Note, this also applies to many other makers. The CTS, for instance, is a 5 series competitor and doesn't belong here either. The new ATS should, though. The G37 is honestly right at the upper end of what's acceptable, especially since you really don't need the AWD version. AWD is only a must for FWD cars in this class. But it's still quite heavy.Now, my favorite car in this class, is the RX-8. Yes, I know, the stupid rear doors aren't exactly styled and put on right, but it's really a sedan masquerading as a ""coupe"". 3000lbs almost exactly and it handles like a dream as you'd expect. It might not be the fastest or the best on a test track, but it dodges in and out of traffic like a go-kart by comparison to most other cars. "
"flightnurse","March 2012"," NYC is looking at a 2011 328ix, so your rant doesn't work. BTW, have you driven a 2012 3 series yet or is your rant purely speculation? The RX8 is a great car, however it LOVES to drink oil and fuel, and why does it love to drink fuel, because he have to rev the crap out of it to just drive the thing. "
"m6user","March 2012"," RX-8 is a Mazda and Mazda, while nice drivers, are not remotely considered to be luxury or even ""near-luxury"". Acura is coming with the ILX this late spring or summer. A smaller replacement for the TSX and can be had in a stick with a little over 200hp I believe. Basically, it's a luxury Civic SI and from what I saw at the auto show looks very nice style wise and the interior treament makes you forget what a disaster the Civic is. Pretty well done and will come in in the high twenties. "
"plekto","March 2012"," I did drive the new generation 3 series and the manual transmission was a bit off and the steering was number than I'd like. It doesn't have the feel of, say, the old E46, or the E36. It's odd in a way. You want performance, but if it's too isolated and soft, it tends to make it feel more like a video game than a driving experience. "
"billyperksii","March 2012"," Do you believe this guy- a RX8. "
"flightnurse","March 2012"," The adaptive steering package takes care of that problem, which I'm betting will come standard in the M sport package coming this summer.I didn't think the transmission was a problem. "

"billyperksii","March 2012"," That's my point- he was rambling about the TL's weight and performance and for the class that the RX8 is in-the RX is considered mediocre.I think the 0-60 time for this car is approaching 8 secs- not that I care.I love Mazda's- I had the Millenna (1st car after graduation) but the RX I think I can live without.

His daily driver is a 335xi w/ a stick. During the test drive I asked him what his opinion of the new F10 328i was. He really likes the 2.0L 4 cyl turbo engine & the 8 speed automatic.

I will leave it to him to decide to roll the dice and pay for arbitration or just write me a check for the difference.Either way, I should know by this weekend which way it's going to go.In the meantime, by best friend told me he's thinking about selling his '05 997...

"qbrozen","March 2012"," the intermediate shaft failures have scared me off the Porsches. I really really wanted to get one this last time out ... just couldn't bring myself to take the risk. "
"markcincinnati","March 2012"," I drove both the G and the TL at speeds up to 100MPH, and I had just come from driving the Audi S4 (also at high speeds) prior to driving the TL.The G seemed like a shoebox on wheels (at the time my daily driver was a 2009 A4 w/sport package.)The TL Advance SH-AWD was the closest car to an S4 that I had tested (and I had tested quite a few.)So, the answer to the question is I did drive the cars more than around the block and way faster than 30MPH. :surprise: "
"markcincinnati","March 2012"," The wheelbase of the TL is 109"". The wheelbase of the A4 and G is longer. The width of my A4 was close to 72"", about the width of a TL. The length of the TL, too very close to the A4 and G. Audis are always given crap for being porky and nose heavy.The Audi, of the three examples, would be my first choice -- if money was no object. The Audi A4 2.0T Prestige with sport package was way more money per month than a TL (or a G.) The G was so tiny, so narrow, I felt like I was in one of my wife's three Audi TT's -- I felt like a bug in it. I noticed no loss of cabin space from my '09 A4 when I went to the TL.In terms of handling, the A4 when pushed hard into a corner understeers -- even with the 19"" sport package; at the same speed the torque vectoring of the TL AWD manages to tame what would have to be noticable understeer. And, despite the sweet 2.0T engine, the 3.7 in the TL is more potent.The TL is on the cutting edge of ugly, I will not argue that point. The Audi's interior is so much better than anyone else's it's not a contest, so the TL's nice leather and fit and finish don't impress me since I was used to the Audi. The G's interior is nice, too, but again it isn't an Audi.By what measures is the TL a boat -- it certainly seems to compete with the Audi even though the Audi does have a longer wheelbase. Or is the Audi in the nautical class too? :confuse: "
"plekto","March 2012"," the intermediate shaft failures have scared me off the Porsches. I really really wanted to get one this last time out ... just couldn't bring myself to take the risk. The reason for this is actually the oil. The engine was designed for high-zinc oils that are common in Europe and were judged to be minimally acceptable in the U.S. at the time. But the EPA drove the maximum levels to 1200ppm and people started to notice a few problems. Then they dropped the levels to 800ppm and people started using synthetics with sometimes none of the original anti-wear additives in them. Suddenly everyone's engines were eating themselves.There is a company that makes a properly designed replacement part for it, though (new bearing sets), and if the vehicle doesn't have this ""upgrade"" already, then deduct the price from the vehicle as any of that series engine will eventually fail, guaranteed, without the mod, as you cannot physically buy high zinc oil in the U.S. any more due to the EPA's idiocy. The problem was that the additives traditionally caused cats to die in 50-60K miles. Now the government mandates 100K+ for cats, which meant less additives. The oil makers were caught in the middle. This is exactly like the paint fiasco that happened in the 80s and 90s, where paint was peeling off of cars due to the EPA requiring different types of paint formulations. Eventually they fixed it around 2000 or so, but in this case, it's a generation of engines that won't make it past 150K, (anything that's based off of engineering previous to ~2000 or so) and some like the Boxster and Rotary engines that rev really fast just simply die in half that time. Note - this also affects a lot of S2000s, which routinely get revved hard.And, yes, it really does happen. I lost my 67 Mercedes' engine after two oil changes when the EPA switched the levels without telling anyone. Working fine and ~5000 miles later (was my daily driver at the time) the entire internals were shot. Not even re-buildable. The oil simply provided no protection and it ate the top end, bottom end, the bearings, and even the gaskets. No smoke or issues and then a pile of parts. So I feel for the poor Porsche owners as I've been there myself.As of 2009, Porsche has finally redesigned the engines and the problems are controlled if you use high mileage non-synthetic in the engines. (Castrol or similar) But a lot of people still run racing oil in them and ignore the EPA's ""requirements"". I'd do the same too, if I had a $50K Porsche sitting in my driveway. Better to be safe than sorry when a rebuild can cost 10K+ on these things.All of that said, the Boxster *is* a good ride. The one to stay away from, though, is the Cayman S. It's significantly more rigid and quieter. It's downright dangerous as you find yourself having a hard time just pulling yourself out of the seat at the showroom, let alone de-scrambling your brain's idea of ""normal"" after a test-drive. :P "
"qbrozen","March 2012"," There is a company that makes a properly designed replacement part for itYes, and I looked into that. It is still a big big job to do the swap. If you can find the right car from a Porsche specialist or private owner who can tell you if its been done, great. I couldn't find any such vehicle in my budget, however. Its just something to be aware of. "

I'm going up there Tuesday to have them look at my trade & hopefully put a deposit down on my new 328xi. "
"fedlawman","March 2012"," Really Sweeny?Is that an attempt at humor that got lost in translation (I hope it was) or are you really that ignorant and callous?For the record, my brother took full responsibility for the accident like an adult. He knows my M is irreplaceable and offered to do whatever it took to make things right. I let him choose the course of action every step of the way. I spent valuable time and money copying every document related to the restoration and maintenance of my car and FedEx'ing it to USAA to try and increase the settlement. I told my brother we could hire and appraiser and take USAA to arbitration and likely increase the settlement. I told him i would pursue every avenue for as long as it took and let him decide every step of the way. I took all of these actions In a good faith effort to lesson my brother's financial burden.He's a grown man and knows I went to bat for him as best I could - and in the end, all I'll have is a few bucks (not enough to replace my M) and an empty garage.And now, if you don't mind, I'm going to stop chatting with you and go sit at the grown up table again.

"nyccarguy","March 2012"," I really do feel for you. When you asked the question about insurance here, my stomach actually got a knot. I remember when you sold your TSX for that M3. Obviously we all know the most important thing is that you and your brother did not get hurt. You did drive that car as it was meant to be driven. I know you enjoyed it every time you turned the key. I'm proud of you & you truly deserve a round of applause.I have a friend who works in the insurance biz & he just offered me this suggestion:Tell them he's going to contact the Department of Insurance to report them for ""Bad Faith"" and retain an attorney to sue them for the same. He could wind up getting what he reasonably needs/wants plus attorney fees and maybe even more $$$. Insurance Companies dont want to be found practicing ""bad faith"". That's very illegal and carries a lot of unwanted attention and penalties. "

I have mentioned I'm looking for a 2010-2011 335 x drive with stick because i miss rowing my own boat - and Infiniti will no bring a stick in awd form or I would already have it because yes I like 10k (or more) in saving and 90% (?) of the performance and lux.

"m6user","March 2012"," Why isn't the VW CC not included in this group? Just had one as a rental in San Diego, have to say, was very impressed.

"ivan_99","March 2012"," I agree with the VW CC being added (not like it's a vote...). I would rank it higher than many in this group; and if price is included it would be near the top.How about the departed VW Phaeton? That has 'some' luxury elements to it How about the Hyundai Genesis 5.0 R-Spec...seems luxurious and sporty (for under 50k).I think the exclusivity of a name (take your pick, MB, Lexus, etc) is fading now that you can option-up solid, well-build 'regular' vehicles. IMO there are some 'lesser' vehicles such as a Focus Titanium (and soon ST) that are more rewarding and more luxurious than a TSX (no offense to TSX owners...I actually like the old and new ones). Of course the luxury dealer network also comes into play. My Lexus dealer is far above any another other I've visited (Audi, Infiniti)I'm not certain the omission of a mini-van is a qualifier for luxury status; MB R-Class (no sliding doors...but we all know it's a mini-van). As well as many other ""suv's"" that are mini-van's with the convenient sliding doors removed.Could be I just don't see the value of the ""name"" club anymore... "
"m6user","March 2012"," Could be I just don't see the value of the ""name"" club anymore... I agree to a degree but just because someone doesn't see the value doesn't mean they don't exist. There are still clearly luxury brands versus main brands or whatever one wants to call them and luxury brands are what is in the title of this forum. I don't think anyone would pay the money for some of these brands if the warranty and dealer experience were like going to your Ford dealer. It's a package deal. "
"cdnpinhead","March 2012"," in a colleague's Kia rental last week, it's becoming apparent, at least to me, that all cars are really good these daysI rented a Dodge Charger at MSP because National didn't have any GM cars available--this time of the year they want to rent trucks, but I want a car. I don't especially like GM stuff, but I do know where to find all the controls (it's called standard work). Either way, the Charger was a fine ride, and I figured out most of its controls fairly quickly (except for the fuel door release, which took awhile).The charger and the Kia were both worlds better than most cars available 10 years ago.Given the pissing match that this board has become, mostly due to him who shall remain nameless, it's still worth pointing out that ALL these cars are good. Everyone is railing about marginal stuff.Not a bad place to be. "
"sweendogy","March 2012"," Good points - I would also add people are keeping there cars longer then try did 10 years ago- quality, Kia Hyundai has brought a new dynamic to the overall car market that cheap cars that run as good as any. Cars today need gas and oil (every 5-10k) an not much else over the first 30k miles, so maintence cosra are low as well. Consumer reports had Subaru as it's top overall manufacture- a niche company at best 10 years ago here in the states. I agree the pissing by ""him"" stinks even thou hes opinions differ from ours- as long as he backs his comments with fact- or reviews he should continue. "
"mkahn21","March 2012"," I haven't researched this class since 2006, when I bought a TL. Still love that car: >95K miles and going strong.We're replacing our other car (a crossover), and I want another entry lux sport sedan. Price limit: low $40s. Must have AWD, and at least a tendency toward the aggressive/handling rather than the comfort/luxury end of the spectrum. Finally, the nav and controls must be highly intuitive.I test drove 3 cars this weekend: G37x, S60 T6, and A4 quattro. All had similar ""premium"" packages and navigation. I ruled out the new TL, my dad has one and I don't like the interface and am ""meh"" on the styling. Plus it feels too big. Heck, I think I even like my previous generation TL better.Impressions: G37x: Awesome drive, great interior. I left the lot trying to think of something I didn't like about the car. Trunk space isn't huge ... that's about it. I couldn't find a compromise anywhere. Really a standard bearer, even 4 model years into its generational life.S60 T6: I didn't expect to love this car, but I did. I thought its handling and power were up there with the Infiniti. Plus the seats are amazingly comfortable, and the exterior styling really appeals to me. The only drawback is the nav system/computer - I thought the buttons were too small and the whole interactive experience was less easy than it could be. Still, a great car and a welcome surprise.A4 quattro: Outside and in, this car is gorgeous, beautiful, luxurious, well-appointed, pick the adjective. It's just a pleasure to look at, sit in, and touch. Even the nav/multiscreen monitor was pleasant to look at. The handling is superb and it's probably the most athletic of the 3 around corners. The word ""taut"" readily comes to mind. I just wish it were quicker off the line. The A4 didn't leave me breathless the way the other 2 did.For value (which I define as how much power and goodies you get for your money), I think the G37x is a star: $2K-$3K less than the others comparably equipped, and $7K less than the BMW 335i xDrive, which I'd buy if money were no object.This class really is impressive with a lot of smart, good choices. I'll be buying my G37x shortly and will hopefully get many years of pleasure from it ...... Unless anyone suggests I check out another option I've missed? "

"flightnurse","March 2012"," If you haven't driven a CC give one a try, the feel, the touch of the interior is very much luxury, the fit and finish is that of Audi and BMW. Just because it says VW and not Audi doesn't mean it shouldn't be listed. Again, the new 300 is a far cry from the previous Gen... Just wish the engineers didn't program the tranny to upshift so fast and allow the engine to go into ECO mode so quick. Other then that, the fit and finish is first rate, the power is better then most car listed as ELLPS. "

"robbieg","March 2012"," Have you sat in a Toureg? Those things are awesome. Just because a car company makes a car that sells for 16000 doesn't mean it can't make a luxury car. A loaded up CC is as nice inside as a Toureg. Does Lexus even sell any IS 350s? The TSX is for buyers that can't or won't pay 40,000 for a sports sedan. Isn't a manual transmission G a sportier car than a BMW 328 with a slushbox? "
"nyccarguy","March 2012"," I'm working. Going tomorrow to have the TSX appraised by Wide World BMW. Trying not to put too many miles on it. Since it is gorgeous out today, I took the Prelude to work. Kept it at 65 mph on the way in. "
"dbledmndk2","March 2012"," Thanks for sharing your impressions and I recently just had to make a similar decision, although I didn't even test drive the Volvo. Like you I ruled out the TL right away as the interface was really clunky and while I liked the reliability and the Honda lineage I wanted something a little different. I ended up going with the G37x because the lease deal was way better than the A4 and I've been really happy for my first 3 weeks with the car. Filling up the first time is a little eye opening and seeing the MPG never climb above 20 is also a little concerning, but the thing is like a rocket (and almost as loud) and it's a lot of fun to drive. Good luck with the purchase! "
"m6user","March 2012"," What's your point. A G is an Infiniti which is the luxury division of Nissan. Isn't Audi the luxury division of VW? I could name half a dozen cars that have power and feel luxurious but that doesn't make them luxury cars. Like I said before, a luxury car comes as a package with the dealer experience part of that package. From what I've heard and read, going to a VW dealership for service is not usually a pleasant experience. What does how many IS 350s are sold have to do with anything? I would assume a G stick is a little sportier than a BMW 328 with auto. Does that mean the 328 shouldn't be discussed here? You make no sense.I don't disagree that a CC or Toureg or Tiguan may feel nice and drive nice. But that doesn't make them ELLPS especially the the SUVs because they aren't even sedans. And again, VW is not and certainly doesn't market itself as a luxury brand.Yes, btw, I have sat in both and the Tiguan and the Jetta GLI just a few weeks ago at the auto show. They are nice but not luxury vehicles. "
"sweendogy","March 2012"," I owned a vw and the dealership experiance is nothing great- and I was there alot with my Gli- but like I said before the newer cars you should not be at any dealership due to extended maintience schedules. What do you need to do in the first 30k? I think the whole lux sheak feel of the lux dealer should be a thing of the past- great they have a lattes but they also high maintence bills- "
"flightnurse","March 2012"," Just as much as you read everybody else's.. "
"plekto","March 2012"," You might consider the Mercedes C with the sport package. It's actually a much better car than the Volvo. But the car that you really need to try before you buy a G37 is a Cadillac CTS. It's flat-out a better car than the G37 as it does nearly the same things when driven hard, but has a nicer interior and is better in every day traffic as well. Also, the rebates are quite good. At the end of the model year, expect to be able to get the AWD model for close to 37-38K.GM makes exactly two great cars. The Corvette is one, and this is the other. "
"graphicguy","March 2012"," pletko...I agree with you about the CTS. I test drove a coupe before I bought either my TL or my 335i. They are very good cars. I had a run-in with Cadillac some years ago (with my Mother's car). It was an experience that turned me off to Cadillac forever.Disagree about the MB C class. I think for the money, there are a lot of other, better choices out there.I must be a party of one, because I like the Volvo S60, too....especially their sport version. I even like the way they look. Can't explain why I've never pulled the trigger on one, though.BTW, while not a part of this group, if anyone is out there shopping, I was also impressed with the Taurus SHO. It's big, it's heavy. But, it's way fast, handles well, and has just about all the tech anyone could want in a car. "
"flightnurse","March 2012"," Graphicguy I'm lucky that my work have me traveling a lot, and I rent many cars, I have driven the CTS 92011 MY) and I liked it, The fit n finish wasn't as good as say Audi or BMW but much better then most GM cars.

"Kirstie_H","March 2012"," Not welcome here. Posts removed and will continue to be removed. Any conversations that are contrary to creating a welcoming atmosphere in here aren't productive. "
"mkahn21","March 2012"," In my initial evaluations (online and at the Philly car show in February), I looked at both the CTS and the C class.The CTS just felt and looked big, relative to the others. There's a fan base out there for this car and the reviews are stellar, but I just didn't feel ""right"" inside the vehicle. Plus it's expensive when equipped comparably. (Edit - I didn't see the note above about the rebates. Interesting and maybe I'll revisit before the deal is done.)The C-class is an interesting case. It's probably a great car, performance wise. It's just that I didn't want to put out a certain, vaguely defined impression with colleagues and bosses about being a Mercedes driver. Interesting how these kinds of things play out in the decision making that have nothing to do with the actual vehicle performance itself.And what's really interesting is that I would have had no issue whatsoever putting out an impression of being a BMW driver, if I could afford it. "
"flightnurse","March 2012"," You have never owned a Vette ?... I'm not too sure if GM will ever produce a excellent sport car, the vette is a blast to drive but own one for a few years, drive it and watch it fall apart. I loved my vette but it wasnt screwed together all that well. BTW, I had MY 2000. "
"plekto","March 2012"," Of course, the *old* GM was an entirely different story. Even the previous generation CTS was a joke compared to the present one. It's the first car that GM has ever made that the engine doesn't sound like it came out of a tractor.I've been not too impressed with Volvos as of late. They frankly remind me of fancy 90s era GM FWD sedans. Now, that said, when I had to help my parents decide between cars, it came down to a decision between a G37, a C350 Sport, and a CTS. The C350 was easily the most luxurious. Not that flashy Beverly Hills crud, but more like the old wealth you see in the upper end of London. Understated but obviously much better.Handling and driveability went to the G37. But it also felt plastic and ""thin"". Kind of like the same problem you get with the TSX. It's nice and all, but it doesn't have the same feel of say, an Audi or Porsche. You know that feeling. Leather alone doesn't make a luxury car. ""Leather plated"" comes to mind for many cars these days. Now, the Infiniti M, that's a whole other story. Check it out and then wonder why they didn't make the G feel more like a smaller M. To top it all off, the G37 looks like everyone else's jellybean. Is it an Infiniti or a Hyundai or... Who knows until you get within about 100 ft of it. The CTS was the best combination of the two, though. It's a usable car for daily driving and feels like it's worth the money inside and out. Bit of sport, bit of luxury, and exactly what a luxury sport sedan should be. Only the BMW felt similar to drive. But the BMW also has two major issues. One is the cost of repairs, and the other is that it's not a U.S. company. Now, this is a minor point, to be sure, but there is something to be said about driving a domestic car and not being part of the typical sheeple horde. Plus, nobody poor drives a new Cadillac. There is till some status involved with owning one, even if it is just a little bit. :P "
"graphicguy","March 2012"," pletko, flightnurse....you're both probably right. My experiences with Cadillac was during what one might consider their ""product malaise"" period. To be frank, the CTS coupe test drive was the one with the DI motor. While not the fastest, it certainly held its own. Plus, I thought the interior quality, fit/finish rivaled that of any Audi and my own 3 series. I might even say it was a bit better than either.There is still an air of luxury (and now add a healthy dose of ""sport"") when driving a CTS.The Cadillac dealership I visited wasn't the one I had so much trouble with previously, either. So, I think that's a positive. He tried his damnedest to make a deal for me, too. He knew of my previous travails. He ate into his holdback and offered me well over what my trade was worth. It just stuck in my head the previous experience.Too bad! The CTS (especially the coupe) is a good looking car, that drives well, and has bumped up the quality quite a bit.That said, I really like my 3. So, it will stay in my stable at least through the warranty period (which is an achievement for me :surprise: ). "
"graphicguy","March 2012"," mkahn....as always, only you know what you'll be happy with. Again, this was on an '11 CTS, but I know the dealer I visited, who's not part of a large conglomerate, with only one store, was willing to move units. I actually met the owner. He personally gave me the price (which was invoice, less rebates, less some of his holdback). All-in-all, he offered me a CTS coupe, totally loaded, for about $7K off MSRP and well under invoice.This was last summer, so I don't know if such a deal could be made today.Either way, they're nice cars. "
"sweendogy","March 2012"," Was told by a local dealer that the 2013 sedans (dk about coupes) will be automatic only. Don't know if this is fact but what he relayed to me when I inquired about ordering one. I've searched the web- only thing I've seen is they discontinued manuals on 535 x drives.If that's the case this leaves a select few with manual awd option, which would bum me out as a driving enthuiaists.

"plekto","March 2012"," Yeah, nothing kills true sporting excitement like getting rid of a fine manual gearbox and putting in a box full of rubber bands and hydraulics. That's one thing Mercedes and Volvo have also done recently, and why I'm not putting them on my short list any more. "
"ivan_99","March 2012"," I loved the CTS, especially the cooled seats that seemed to function far better than other vehicles (TX hot...hate sweaty back...).My big problem with the CTS (a few years ago when I drove one) was the Nav interface. It seemed real low tech with low resolution pixelated graphics; reminded me of an 80's video game. Another issues was the slow shifting automatic...Seems like a silly thing to disqualify a contender but I couldn't look at that screen for 3-5 years.I'd put the interior design at #1 and materials #2 for a fully loaded CTS with 'sky' roof. One of the few vehicles I've been in where I said ""wow"". The 'low-end' CTS really did look like a low-end vehicle (drove one to try the manual).Another 'plus' is the exterior is unique (love it or hate it). "
"graphicguy","March 2012"," ivan...depends on how long ago you looked. The current CTS Nav is very clear, with very nice graphics. I didn't take a long enough test drive to really give the trans a work out. Seemed fine to me. But, who knows over the long haul.I've always felt that GM makes some of the best automatic transmissions in the world however.Not a big fan of Bose. But, the one in the CTS (surround system) was probably better than any factory stereo I've heard. And, I've heard a lot of good ones....the Pioneer in my former TL, the Harmon Kardon in my current 335i, and the Bang & Olufson I heard test driving an Audi S4. "
"rayainsw","March 2012"," I drove a 'Vette for 30,000 miles.I agree that it was a blast to drive.Mine did not 'fall apart'.- RayYMMV "
"dag63","March 2012"," I'm looking to upgrade from my '07 Mazda3s. While I love the Mazda's handling, braking, well-bolstered seats, and Bose stereo, its a little small, underpowered, and noisy. I do not, however, want to give up the manual transmission and the excellent steering feel. I am a little worried that some of the ELLPS lose that steering feel with a little too much power assistance. Trying to keep the price in the mid $30k range. Thanks, in advance, for any advice. "
"sweendogy","March 2012"," I like the fact your keeping the manual transmission - its the way to go for sure. Prob your going to have is mid 30k price.They only one comes to mind is the Tsx which is quiet and has a good engine and sweet 6 speed- car is a little bloated in current form thou- has a nice radio and good service - and will be replaced by a new acura based on the civic soon. . The is250 (haven't driven it) could prob be had for that range if you could find a manual on a dealer lot. G 37 is over 40k along with the TL - but with deals you could prob get under 40k. BMW 328 if you could find a stripper or a experimental deal situation, maybe a cTs in stripped form . I might be missing some. Good luck- "
"tlong","March 2012"," IMHO it's going to be tough in the $30's. There isn't much out there that handles like a Mazda 3 until you get to the $40's. The TSX also came to my mind, but no way it will handle like the Mazda, although it would be more luxurious. How about the G25? Or perhaps a fully loaded Jetta. "
"harlequin1971","March 2012"," I bought an 08 VW GLI last summer and couldn't be much happier for the price. Yes, I bought it used, but with only 18k miles, it was still very fresh inside and out.The GLI has a slick 6sp manual OR the very popular DSG. I have the manual and it drives very well.Starting in the mid 30s, you can outfit them with the full options kit at $30. If you want to tick up the performance, the turbo can be chipped for an extra 50 hp and swapping brakes would return you a car that pulls like a MazdaSpeed3, nets 30 mph highway, has four doors, and can carve curves in a slightly subdued, but still spirited way. The car buttons down nicely.Haven't owned the CTS or the 3, but have driven both and the A4 and I would put this car one slim tier below them - but without any of the snob factor. It becomes a very subtle Q-ship, and every time I zip past someone on the country roads between home and the cities, I get a pretty big grin from the pull of that turbo.And yes, I just recently chipped my car (REVO) and it has added a brashness to the car's personality - still a q-ship, but with even more grunt under the gas pedal. "
"stickguy","March 2012"," No stick in the G25 pretty sure.the TSX is probably the best choice in the category, unless you can find a killer deal on a strippo 3 series.Can the Passat V6 come with stick? not really a handler, but an interesting option.Audi A4 come in price wise? "

"andres3","March 2012"," Agreed that Audi's/VW's 2.0T engine chipped is the best way to go for 35K and under.I have an '06 A3 with Unitronics Stage 2 ""chipping."" The stage 2 takes advantage of my custom exhaust system over the stage 1. Put in an S3 intercooler and I basically have a non-Quattro S3 which is a car that is far TOO good for the US market.  :shades: It is very fast. Not sure about REVO's software, but most ""chipped"" 2.0T motors get around 280-290 lb/ft of torque to go along with the 250-260 HP. "
"stickguy","March 2012"," that baby sounds loaded. Nice discount there from MSRP certainly. "
"m6user","March 2012"," If by mid 30s you are talking 33-37k you should be able to get into a base G37 as long as you don't load it up with nav and sports pkg. Discounts are fairly heavy off MSRP. "
"ivan_99","March 2012"," The CTS I drove was 3 years ago...think it was right when they came out.The tranny was very smooth shifting. When used in tiptronic mode with spirited driving it would take a very long time to shift after I made my selection...shift lever...1 second...2 second...almost 3...shift.But as a disclaimer...I find all 'pretend manual' automatics to be that way. Unless you're driving in the hills/mountains where you'd like to hold your gear the tiptronic isn't very useful. Love the DSG...haven't drive the new 8spd. "
"tlong","March 2012"," No stick in the G25 pretty sure.Yeah, after I wrote my original post I thought that might be the case.It's kind of a sparse field between the Mazda 3 and the ELLPS's if you are looking for a stick shift AND really good handling. You would think some automaker would come in and plug that hole around $30-$35K. "
"kyfdx","March 2012"," VW CC or TSX.. I don't think the TSX gives up any handling to the Mazda3, though...I like the GLI idea, but I've never driven the new model.... "
"andres3","March 2012"," It's kind of a sparse field between the Mazda 3 and the ELLPS's if you are looking for a stick shift AND really good handling.Sounds like someone needs to write Audi that they'd want an A3 sedan if they want something with great handling, a 6 speed stick, and slot in the 30 to 35K zone.

"dag63","March 2012"," Thanks for all your responses. A lot to ponder. I drove a Volvo S60 and a BMW 328 tonight. Didn't think much of the Volvo; great interior (seats and stereo, especially), drove like the '97 850 i owned before the Mazda. The 328 was a sweet ride, but I have three problems with it: 1) $40k for a low-end model, though I could probably get it for $38k or so (thank you, Costco); 2) even without the tech package, it still has more tech than I need (I can check with tire pressure and oil on a little screen - why?); and 3) most importantly, it's still kinda small to carry two teenage boys in the back on a road trip. I may look at slightly larger cars (probably not ELLPS), like the Chrysler 300, Hyundai Genesis, and Passat V6. If I could afford an A6, 528, or M37, I'd really look into those. "

"markcincinnati","March 2012"," I had -- my wife had -- a couple of those slightly smaller A4's back in the late 90's, with the, at the time V6 and stick shift (and with the $500 sport package), these were very nice cars; and actually very reliable as I recall.But, those were the days when we were in and out of a car in about 45,000 miles, so even for a German car it was pretty easy to be reliable for that long.These days, I look for durability, performance and reliability -- but not exactly in that order.I had a 2005 A6 fully loaded, went to a 2009 A4 Prestige+sport and then into a 2012 SH-AWD TL Advance -- I think the TL, the more I drive it, actually is pretty close ""in feel"" to the A6, except the TL has 305HP where the A6 had 265 -- both had 6 speed autos and the seats in the Audi were the upgraded version.In any case, I did lease the TL for 45K miles thinking, MAYBE (but unlikely), this is a car with sufficient durability that it could be kept for a longer period.Now I think I will look at another Acura in 26 months, but will also look at Infiniti (my wife's is great) and the Germans, too. In any case that new A3 for 2014 is sure purty -- and if it were the size of the old A4 we used to have, well it's just my wife, Sammy the dog and me, so I wouldn't really miss rear seat leg room much. Be way cool, too, if it had an 8 speed tip and the current 2.0T 211 HP 258 lb ft engine. In that car, that engine would feel ""industrial strength."" :shades: "

"renssils","March 2012"," My 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD is almost 11 months old, has been driven almost 14,000 miles, and has 410 days to go till the lease expires. I can't wait.First the good. The engine and transmission are superb. The all-wheel-drive performs well. The sound system is first-class. The seats are comfortable. Roadholding and handling can be so good, if the car has high-performance summer tires, as my TL once had. Properly shod, the TL SH-AWD with Advance Package is fun to drive. The folks at the huge Acura dealer are unfailingly polite. Reliability has good other than a failed battery and a failed air-conditioning system.Now the bad. The TL places form, that is, styling, before function and that includes safety. The outward visibility is dangerously limited. I have had three near accidents because the blind spots are huge, not to mention the long, wide hood and the front's low ground clearance. The trunk is small, hard to load, has a high lift-over, and is awkwardly proportioned, not to mention that the rear deck lid has a nasty point at its center. Be sure to raise the deck lid to its maximum height! Entry and exit to the rear passenger compartment isn't easy for many folks. The air-conditioning system failed due to lack of refrigerant and because the dealer couldn't find anything wrong, he charged me $151.33 and said that there was no warranty coverage as the car has more than 12,000 miles. (I will pursue this issue with the dealer's management and Acura.) The battery has been replaced under warranty. An irksome rattle was allegedly cured under warranty by adding insulation to the trunk. On the 19-inch Goodyear Eagle tires road noise is excessive and grip is low. The instrument panels are highly styled to a fare-thee-well at the expense of ease of use; try to find the clock.I drove a 2012 Acura TX sportswagon and found it nimble and pleasing to drive. It made the TL seem clumsy by contrast.I had considered and drove several new cars, including an Audi A6, Infinite M37 and M56, BMW 535ix and Volvo S80 and S60 T6, before I chose the Acura TL because of its reputation for reliability, good performance, and price.I won't miss the 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD.__________________2012 TL SH-AWD with Tech and Advance Packages.

"flightnurse","March 2012"," Ivan, my partner and I were in the market for a SUV, he is real big on reading consumer reports (CR), so after checking CR we went to the Acrua dealer. After talking to the salesmen, he handed us the keys to a MDX, and told us to take for a drive. When I quizzed him on what he meant by drive, his reply was, we close at 9. We hoped in the MDX and off we went, we were gone for about an hour (or two), we drove surface street, highway (rush hour) played with the nav system, we got a good sense of the vehicle, we ended up buying one a week later. We knew more about the MDX after that drive then any other SUV we drove, I remember the MB dealer telling us, we don't like to put a lot of ""useless"" miles on our vehicles, so we only drive about 15 minutes or so, no problem, turned the ML350 around and headed back for the dealer.

I bought it on 8/29/09 on the last day of Cash 4 Clunkers to replace 2 BMWs. My 1990 E30 325i Coupe failed project car that my trusted mechanic declared dead. We were also leasing a 2007 X3 that had 38,000 miles after 2 years. We were allowed 45,000 for the total 3 years. So I bought the TSX with the intention of it being my wife's daily driver that I'd get some seat time in on the weekends. "
"nyccarguy","March 2012"," When we were blessed with having our 3rd child, we needed a bigger vehicle with the ability to handle New England winters, haul kids' stuff, and hold at least 3 (our vey are they big) child safety seats. We bought a 2011 Pilot. Given the fact that the TSX was less than 2 years old at the time I didn't want to take a steep depreciation hit, so I kept it, made the Pilot my wife's daily driver, & put my beloved Prelude into semi retirement. So on Thursday night, I traded in my TSX for a 2011 BMW 328xi.So far I'm completely blown out of the water about how well this car drives. I hate to sound like I've been reading too much Car & Driver, but the steering is perfectly weighted (nice & heavy, how it should be) & telepathic. I love the chassis' balance. Driving a car with RWD just feels very natural. The inline 6 is just so amazingly smooth. The brakes are strong. Suspension tuning is wonderful. Firm & solid, but nowhere near uncomfortable.My Acura was a nice car. Excellent fit & finish. The 2.4L 4 banger loves to rev. The transmission is crisp and doesn't struggle keeping the engine in its sweet spot. The suspension is tuned to allow road feel. It's good, until I drove the 3er.The electric power steering is artificial and lifeless. The brakes are weak. "
"nyccarguy","March 2012"," of The Departed "
"sweendogy","March 2012"," Brad I know we have had battles in the past over the tsx- so given the wide performance gap between the BMW (the standard) and the Acura - does it truly belong in this group? "
"fedlawman","March 2012"," Congrats NYC, it sounds like a great car.I've never driven an xi but from what you say, it sounds like it's not much different from the RWD 3er - probably don't really notice the difference day to day. "
"nyccarguy","March 2012"," The hosts won't take it down, no matter how much you scream. I think the Acura for this group should be the TL/SH AWD. I really don't think any car in this class actually ""competes"" with the BMW. I'm that impressed. However, there are many who don't put the premium on driving dynamics that those of us here do. "
"nyccarguy","March 2012"," Thank-you so much fedlawman. I appreciate it. I'll readily admit that my driving skills are merely average, especially compared to you, Flightnurse, & Roadburner. As far as I'm concerned my car is RWD. The biggest difference I notice between my 328 & my Prelude is weight. My Prelude only weighs a little more than 3000 lbs, the BMW a lot more. The other thing I notice is that my Prelude's cable actuated throttle is much more linear & responsive. "
"fedlawman","March 2012"," Thanks NYC, but I'm afraid you might assume too much. We all like to think we're good drivers, but I doubt if my skills are as impressive as you think.I totally agree with you on throttles. I've never met a FBW throttle I liked. Combined with a turbo (yes, even the 335i quick spooler), it's even worse - like a rubber band between your foot and the engine.I'll choose a cable every time.I can't wait to see pictures of your new ride!v/r "

"flightnurse","March 2012"," NYC, what I find interesting is when people get behind the wheel of a BMW and have time to drive it, they get it.Last week I was in Austin for South-by-southwest, their big music and tech festival, I was out of the loop and was looking forward to hearing about your car when I got back, however now I'm back on Long Guyland I love hearing how you are gushing over the car.. Once again Congrats...FN "

"qbrozen","March 2012"," I don't use one.The 135 came with a built-in one intalled by the PO. I can't remember the name of it off the top of my head. I know it was expensive. But the damned thing doesn't work. The lights flash and it beeps when I start the car, but that's it. No signals when radar is around. I even emailed the company to ask about it, but they never replied. "

Just try not to drive the van too fast! "
"fedlawman","March 2012"," ""Which radar detector do you guys use?""Did you forget what I do for a living? :blush: Seriously though, I'm older and wiser nowadays and I respect and abide by almost all traffic laws whenever it's prudent. "
"graphicguy","March 2012"," fed....not that I would do this, but I've heard that the new Escorts are some of the best on the market with a way to be updated by the user. Both Valentine and Escort are based in Cincinnati (my home town), so they probably compete harder here than they do anywhere else. Plus, the Escort ""falses"" a lot less than the Valentine V1, making it very easy to ignore most of its warnings (and makes it seriously annoying).Again, not that I know any of this on a personal basis.....just what I've heard. :P "
"stickguy","March 2012"," my BIL (the one with multiple BMWs, including a new style 550) got one of those interactive Escorts for Christmas. He was anxious waiting for other people in the area to get them (not much market there I don't think) so there would be enough coverage to make the user flagging worth while. "
"graphicguy","March 2012"," stick....I wondered that myself. In order for the interactivity of the Escort to be effective, other people on the road would have to have one. Nevertheless, there's some history between the Escort and Valentine. Valentine founder (name escapes me....it might be Valentine) originally worked for Escort as an engineer. I guess they rejected one of his designs, and he left to start his own company. Now, this was a lot of years ago. But, they both emerged as the two titans in the industry.The downside for Valentine, they only have one product, their detector. Escort has several versions of their detectors, as well as some commercial radar engineering they do for others.Two really good products in their field (Escort, Valentine) that duke it out. You use either one the way they tell you to use it, you won't get a ticket (unless you get caught with instant one laser when no one is travelling in front of you). Or, they clock you from the air (which is the only time I've been caught speeding).I've used both. Can't go wrong with either. I like the Escort for the size factor and usability the best, however. "
"flightnurse","March 2012"," NYC I have a brother who is a retired Motor Cop, he was/is an expert in the field of radar and radar detectors. Most Motor Cops (motorcycle) can peg the speed of a car before using a radar. Also they can capture your speed before your radar detector goes off. The only good they are is if you are in a pack of cars and the cop shoots his gun in your direction, then your radar will go off. I don't use one, I just watch my speed (most of the time.) "
"ivan_99","March 2012"," Amazing thing is how quickly they can spot the infraction...I was in a ride-along with a relative who's a state trooper and before I was able to look up we were going across the median with the lights on.Much more fun chasing than being chased  "
"flightnurse","March 2012"," Yes, I agree, I was amazed how very accurate my brother could peg someone's speed (off my 2 MPH) before using his radar gun... "
"sweendogy","March 2012"," When I'm driving on the LIE - I look for the nearest 328 rolling up behind me- (pretty frequent) then I let them pass - press them a bit as I slide behind, cop will always give the ticket to the BMW over the Nissan 8 days a week- works like clockwork. "
"flightnurse","March 2012"," Interesting I don't see many 328i on the LIE, however I only drive it from JFK (Via Bell Prkway to LIE) to Holtsville, then on to Medford. Outwest here the police are pulling over 2-3 and at time 4 cars for speeding, since all cities are hurting for money. Now I'm not too sure why anyone want to speed on the LIE it has to be one of the worse freeways with unkept road condition I have seen. "
"graphicguy","March 2012"," My best friend's wife is a police woman in one of the burgs near me. I asked her about this topic last night. While she says she's pretty good at guessing the speed of cars by sight, the trick is to have evidence to use in court (which her ""guesstimate"" of speed is not). So, the radar/laser detector provides that.Most modern radar detectors will ""sniff out"" a radar source in over a mile, which can't be seen by the radar operator. Laser is ""instant on"" (as is some radar devices). The officer has to be relatively close to the vehicle to get their reading (100 yards or so). She said if there's heavy traffic, you won't know if the officer is ""pinging"" you or someone else. But, your laser detector will go off and on in short bursts, full laser detection to none in quick succession (telling you that the officer is taking a speed reading of several cars.She also said that she has to get a lock on your vehicle, of a reflective surface (usually the license plate) and that curvy roads in high traffic areas are the easiest for a ""perp"" to get away with speeding/using a detector.Finally, she mentioned that the time to look for radar/laser, especially ""instant on"" is when you're traveling on roads that offer ""cover"" for a police vehicle to spy on you....a thicket of trees, a valley in the median, an overpass (which she uses with another officer on the road. She also said laser guns are way more expensive, and are harder to use, than radar guns. Thus, there are many, many more radar set ups than laser as municipalities can't understand why the same number of tickets (revenue generators) can't be used instead of the more expensive laser guns. "
"nyccarguy","March 2012"," I've been pretty good about ""being smart"" regarding my speeding ways. When I got my 81 in a 55 ticket a few weeks ago, I completely let my guard down. It was 7:04 AM on a Saturday. If I had a detector, it defintiely would have gone off. The state trooper was sitting on the zebra stripes to an exit ramp right out in the open. This ticket is the 1st I've gotten in almost 10 years.My beautiful, new, BMW 328xi seems to be quite comfortable at speeds that are higher than the posted limit (and I'm strictly following the break-in). I can't wait to get in it & drive home from work. "
"flightnurse","March 2012"," NYC you said it, the car drives so well, the faster you drive it the better it feels, that is the real issue, is keeping the speed down enough not to get a ticket but fast enough to place a smile on ones face... "
"nyccarguy","March 2012"," The car just feels so planted & glued to the road. The chassis seems like it won't loose it's composure unless I do something purposefully stupid (which I don't plan on doing). "
"flightnurse","March 2012"," NYC I couldn't agree more, in my job I travel a lot and rent a lot of cars, I have driven many a Camry, Chrysler 200's and 300's (2011-2012) VW CC's, Malibu's (really the worse car I have driven) Altima's (currently have one) C300s and I have to say the 3 series has a vault feel to it, enjoy it!!

One of my partners got a Fusion Hybrid and it's a better car than the Malibu, but I find the seats uncomfortable and the engine a little unrefined sounding (and the CVT sucks - I hate CVT's).

"nyccarguy","March 2012"," Thanks fedlawman! I cannot wait to make it through break in. I'm so ready to drop the hammer & see what it's made of;)I'll take some interior shots tomorrow.The difference between the BMW & others in the class is the fact that I've wanted a BMW of my own for a long time now. Growing up in the 1980's, I never thought much of the E30's 3 box styling. It wasn't until a close friend graduated college & bought himself a fully loaded E36 325is w/ stick shift & sport package. It stickered for about the same as an E36 M3 at the time. One night we were at a club in Buffalo. At about 2AM, he was trying to hook up with some 6' blonde girl (my friend is 5'6""). I told Chris I needed to get home to drive back to school (Ithaca) the next day. He tossed me his car keys & said: ""see you for breakfast.""I remember sliding into the sport seat of that E36 and it just fit me perfectly. I spent the next 2 1/2 hours tearing around the streets of Buffalo. I even perfectly rotated the car around corners & steered it's tail end with the throttle a few times. At breakfast the next AM. ""Bradd, you know I don't care, but what were you doing with my car last night?""I tell him how much I LOVE his car & how difficult it will be to hop into my car (1992 Beretta GT) & drive back to Ithaca. ""Why?""Chris tells me his sky pager kept going off (they say blowin up now) with messages like: ""Chris, slow down!"". ""Chris, I think someone stole your car.""From that night in Buffalo until last week, I've wanted a BMW of my own. I finally got it! And I love it! "
"fedlawman","March 2012"," That's awesome! The VANOS I-6 is one the sweetest engines of all time. Terrific manual transmission too. Similar to the M20, but a little silkier IIRC. No other engine can match a BMW I-6 for that feeling and sound. Enjoy your 3er because when the I-6's are all gone (and they are going), that sweet, smooth wonderfulness will be but a memory...Now finish your story. Did Chris enjoy his evening as much as you did yours? "
"graphicguy","March 2012"," nyc....you did good on your deal. No worries there.I'm not one of those people who ""baby"" cars during break-in. Now, I don't go tearing through the gears, redlining each one, every time I'm behind the wheel. Nor, do I test the limits of ABS when I first get a car.But, I also don't make any undo effort to keep below a certain speed/RPM. That philosophy has served me well.Wait until you get about 5K miles on it. It seems to really open up then. And MPG improves around that mark, too.Have fun!fedlawman....the 335i still uses the I-6, only it has the dual scroll turbo. It also has all the other current engine tricks with VANOS (variable valve timing) and direct injection. I took mine a step further and had the dealer add the power kit package that boosts HP by 20 and torque by 30+. This is sanctioned by BMW, is warranted the same as the regular BMW warranty, and is mainly an update to the engine management system.I think both 3.0 I-6s (boosted and non-boosted) are way underrated for HP and torque, as both feel a lot stronger than BWM's numbers suggest. "
"nyccarguy","March 2012"," for my man fedlawman's request - "
"flightnurse","March 2012"," I agree I don't baby mine nor do I red line it either, so far I'm averaging 21 in mine I only have 3700 miles on it too.I was under the impression that the 335i engine had the double VANOS (intake and exhaust.) Also if you swap out the intercooler for an aftermarket unit you will increase HP about 15%, this wont void the warranty either. German HP rating, I don't think it is just BMW, but all German brands. For the amount of HP that the german print I have always though they were off their mark. The 7 series with the Twin Turbo 6 is rated at 315hp and 330lbs, moves this 4600lb car fro 0-60 in 5.8 sec. This is a couple of ticks slower then a 3 series 4 cy turbo. Very impressive, when we drove one, I could have sworn it had more HP then what BMW rated it at.FN "
"flightnurse","March 2012"," NYC, I find it interesting that people think they need to go into a dealership and try and beat the dealer down to a profit margin of -10% on cars. I tell people, if YOU are happy with the deal and if YOU are happy with the car then YOU did good. There are monies on all cars that not even edmonds know about, it sounds like you are happy and that is a good thing.BTW, check out www.truecar.com great website for auto pricing "
"nyccarguy","March 2012"," I agree. There's ALWAYS going to be someone who paid less. I couldn't be happier with my car! Besides the $5444 I got off the MSRP, I'm getting 2 pmt credits from BMWFS totaling $1000. Any car deal (no matter what the salesman says) makes the dealer money. You'll never get a car for ""Net Net."". I love my new BMW! "
"graphicguy","March 2012"," flightnurse...you're right. The 335i does utilize BMW's ""double"" VANOS variable valve timing.I'm relatively certain that both the published HP and torque ratings on the i-6 are under rated. "
"stickguy","March 2012"," I am really jonesing for one of those CP) 328is I found. Wonder if my son would care if I skipped paying his senior year college tuition? A diploma is overrated, right? "

"flightnurse","March 2012"," I figured that was the case, however I have been wondering if BMW would build a 328is, this time build based on the sedan not the coupe. Give it more HP, more sport just like the 335is...Have you looked at carmax regarding your BMW. The ZPH forum I'm on finds ZPH 330's that are for sale. It seem's carmax as 3 of them currently for sale, One is a convert in Vegas, one is a sedan and other is coupe, low 20's for them, great price, the coupe I saw the ad, it has mid 50's for mileage, and price was in the low 20's. Good price for what you are getting. Just another avenue for you to look at.FN "
"nyccarguy","March 2012"," Im being an enabler here once again - the car is sweet. "
"fedlawman","March 2012"," GraphicGuy - You're right, of course about the 335i, and it is also a really sweet engine. I was just commenting specifically on NYC's story about his friend's E36. I also agree that it is underrated at 300hp - it definitely feels stronger than that. And yours with the remap upgrade must be a monster. I think they didn't want the 335i to steal M3 sales, but I think it probably does with all that torque. The 335i and M3 have very difference power delivery and personalities, but it's the 335i that feels more muscular in the power department - Americans tend to prefer that feeling.NYC - Thanks for the inside shots. Your car is loaded and looks really nice. Some people don't like wood trim, but I think it looks really classy. Very nice car! "
"graphicguy","March 2012"," stick.....you got your son most of the way. He can pick up the light work on the last year of his tuition..... :P Besides, as nyc pointed out, there are some deals to be had on '11 3 Series right now. Gotta strike while the iron's hot! BTW.....I'm getting between 21 MPG and 22 MPG in town, and just broke 30 MPG in a mix of 90% highway and 10% city driving. I run straightly Costco Premium in it.I'm happy with that. "
"nyccarguy","March 2012"," Thanks so much! Im not a huge wood trim fan either, but love it and everything about my new 3. "
"stickguy","March 2012"," the one at my office (I stopped to look on my way out) was basically your car in black (over tan). A 328i X-drive. Not sure of the navi 9forgot to look). Very nice looking.most likely a 2011 since the inspection sticker was issued 10/11. "
"sweendogy","March 2012"," While i think the 328xi is a great car- Wonder what a leftover g37x with the same options would be- plus you get an extra 100plus hp. Since 90 plus % of 328x cars are auto anyway- I would argue you can get a better car for less. Plus despite what others believe the Infiniti is very low maintenance - i know bc ive spent under 500 bux in 4 years. I know bmw will throw in an oil change or 2 but if you consider the numbers it's still a no- brainier. Sorry to ruin the love fest- and if you dont believe me read consumer reports - the category is entry level - price matters "
"graphicguy","March 2012"," flightnurse....not that it means all that much, but in my younger years a buddy and I had a ragged out Mustang track only car. We used to run it at the local 1/4 mile track.I don't track anymore. But, am always curious about the speed of my personal ride. Very unofficial, and done with a passenger holding a digi watch, but I put up a 0-60 in the low 5s in my 335i. That was before the Power Package install. I'm certain it will it high 4s 0-60 now.Not too shabby for an automatic, 6 cyl. "
"flightnurse","March 2012"," Sweeny only way to find out is go buy one and let us know. "
"flightnurse","March 2012"," Graphic it appears most gear-heads had a mustang at one time. I'm no different,had a nice 65 and 70 Boss 302. I miss the Boss...I'm sure you could get in the mid 4's with the car with a little work, there are many aftermarket companies that have goodies for your car, just depends on how deep your pockets are, really. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSOTgmhhlqgFed, I'm sure the guys who buy a M car new, really don't car that with less money a lesser BMW can beat it...FN "
"fedlawman","March 2012"," True. I saw an M on the road yesterday. I couldn't take my eyes off it. I've seen them plenty, but those huge rear wheels and quad pipes sticking out the back give it a real menacing look. Surprisingly different from the 335i, which should look very similar yet somehow looks more elegant than menacing with the same body. Although I would most definitely be happy with a 335i, I would pay more for the M - it's more my style. If I'm not bouncing off the rev limiter at 8000 RPM, I might as well be driving my wife's Volvo.  "
"flightnurse","March 2012"," I have to agree, listening to the V8 at 8K has a nice sound to it, but then again having a plain jane 335i keep the police away too. "
"mvs1","April 2012"," Student loans are cheap money and this would 'build character'. My parents did the very same, minimal monies from them and the rest on me and/or my employer at the time....made me appreciate what I've worked for now. I do feel for the new graduates that come in with $200k plus student loans hanging over their heads nowadays "
"graphicguy","April 2012"," flightnurse....yeah....we saw a lot of Mustangs at the track.....Cameros, too Ours was a poor excuse for a Mustang. The body was a mess. We took out every and any thing that had weight to it. We got to the point where the body looked like aluminum foil on the inside.We spent most of our effort with the 302, performance heads, exhaust, etc. We trailered it to the track and trailered it home. I wish I still had the money I put into that heap. But, it was fast. And, we had an awfully good time messing with it over the years.It sat in my buddy's back yard for a few years. Finally, his wife told him he either had to use it, or lose it. We sold the drivetrain complete. But, we parted out the rest of what was left of it. I think there are actually two boxes of parts left of it still sitting in his garage.Went to that same track 2-3 years ago just to watch. In addition to Cameros, Firebirds and Mustangs, we saw a lot of WRXs, EVOs, a few of those recent half hearted GM attempts to revive the dead again Pontiac GTOs.The WRXs and EVOs should stick to motor cross. We saw more than one of each blow up on the track. The Fast and Furious crowd think that putting a NOS system in them is all it takes. You could tell when they injected them....they'd get a 50 yard burst, a big ""POW"" and then lots of smoke and limping away. "
"nyccarguy","April 2012"," Always interesting to get another perspective on how my BMW drives, especially from the person who didn't want me to get rid of her beloved Acura (she got the engagement ring & the big wedding). I brought my sons (5 1/2 & 3) to work with me on Saturday. We took the Pilot. This left my wife home with our 4 month old daughter & my BMW. We were on our way to a friend's Saturday night & I asked her: ""So what'd you think of my car?""She tells me: ""It's fast. Very fast. I looked down a few times & was shocked to be going 90.""So I ask her: ""So you like it then?""She replies: ""Well the navigation in the Acura was easier to use.""She doesn't want to admit I'm right! I love her anyway! "
"stickguy","April 2012"," I still get a laugh out of the people that try to make a NA 328 out to be some kind of slug that can barely get out of it's own way. Unless you are out on a track (and I mean a real track, not auto-x) it is still (even an AWD slushbox) scary fast, when you are talking about driving in the real world.Going back a few years, my (sons) 2000 Acura TL is also a ticket magnet. that car just loves to cruise fast. 75 seems to be it's natural loafing sweet spot, and if you don't pay a lot of attention it will creep right up to 90 without noticing it.Was like that since new according to my sister (the original owner) and will still do it now with 162K on the clock. Good thing my son is religious about using CC coming down from the north country (there is a whole lotta nothing on I81 and the NE extension of the PA turnpike, and you could easily cruise at 100) "
"flightnurse","April 2012"," I don't want to hijack this tread, but yeah, those were the days.. BTW, the First Gen Eclipes if set up right were very fast... "
"sweendogy","April 2012"," From a standstill to 60 in 6.5, in auto- fast sure but new wrangler does the same sprint to 60 in 6.7- and I would say that's ""scary fast"" given the fact it's a tin box on stilts. Let's remember the car starts at 37k without options - again nice car but it's not end all be all- certainly not in automatic form and certainly not for the inflated msrp. I would equate this car to Kentucky basketball Always a good team, wins the championship a lot - but doesn't play by the rules- entry level sedan should not cost this much new. "
"graphicguy","April 2012"," sween....gotta say buddy, you've made some pretty far fetched comparisons in this thread, but dragging the jeep into this is about as far out there as you can possibly get. I'm thinking you might want to give it a rest for a while to gather some perspective before venturing into the waters we're swimming in this thread. "
"sweendogy","April 2012"," buddy i really took a deep dive and compaired the jeep to a bmw, buddy- what I did say that that jeep is almost as fast as the bmw to 60, and its scary fast given the structure. (pretty clear where I was going with this) Sure it does not belong here, but on the thread you speak of- we have all talked m3's, porsche, Boss 302s - all within the last month.. If you dont like what I wrote fine but you have added nothing but an insult, buddy.Waters warm and I love to swim.  "
"nyccarguy","April 2012"," sweendogy - I'll agree with you that price absolutely matters in this and any category. Everybody's got a price ceiling, whether its a dollar amount or a payment amount whether you are talking Civic vs. Focus, this current crop of ELLPS, The 5, E, A6 group, and even the 7, S, A8 models.Price drove my purchase. I had equity in my Acura, BMW offered generous discounts and incentives, so I got a car I've been dreaming about since the late 1990's.I love the way the G37X drives. There's something to be said for the fact that the car has an extra almost 100 horsepower. It is a rocket. Its power is intoxicating. It is faster than my 328xi for sure. So you could say the Infiniti offers a faster car for the same or for less money. I don't personally think faster equates to better.Cars in this class aren't all about 0 - 60 mph times. There is so much more to the equation that I know you know, otherwise you wouldn't be driving a G. You'd be driving a 5.0 Mustang or Camaro SS. "
"nyccarguy","April 2012"," When I drive cars, one thing I judge them by is their comfortable driving speed or ""natural loafing sweet spot"" as you so nicely put it. According to me, it is the driving speed at which the car ""feels"" just right driving at. Not full throttle, where's the fire, my wife's water just broke, and her contractions are 2 minutes apart driving.My Prelude feels perfect at 75, even though the tach needle is over 3K. Anything over that and I feel I'm driving the Prelude ""fast,""My former TSX felt just right at 80. Which seems logical given that it is heavier than my Prelude, has more sound deadening material, and an actual overdriven 5th gear.I've had the BMW up at 90 for a few brief moments and the car was as you and my wife have pointed out is ""scary fast."" The car is just inceredibly planted at speed. "
"stickguy","April 2012"," Price is big to me. An unfortunate side effect of being poor! If I only figured out 20 years ago how much I could have saved getting 2 puppies instead of having kids...anyway, that is why I have fully embraced the mantra: depreciation is your friend! Assuming you aren't the first buyer. the couple of CPO 328i models I found last week (a 2008 and a 2009) were going to cost about what a load up Focus would, or a mid-level Camry. IOW, affordable, and a very realistic alternative to brand new.Though I still want to see a Dodge Dart in person! "
"nyccarguy","April 2012"," Stickguy - you don't want a Dodge Dart. I don't care how much of a guised up Alfa Romeo it is. It happens to look great in the pics I've seen. It's not a BMW.Just a personal note about those '08 & '09 CPO 328is (plural). Some of the '09s came with these 16"" wheels standard. They look small on the E90 IMHO.My Mom had an '08 328xi for 3 years & almost 60K miles. Not only was it a great car to drive, but absolutely bulletproof. "
"kdshapiro","April 2012"," There is a refinement in the BMW not present in the G. Only you can decide if that is worth it to you.@nyccarguy - congrats. It is gorgeous. Makes me really miss by ex-BMW. My G cannot match the smoothness of my ex-BMW. HP ain't everything. "
"sweendogy","April 2012"," Agree the refinement is something for sure. I'm sure the new BMW 3 for 2012 should help the dated interior and nav setup, as others have pointed out. Audi continues to excel at interiors and is the standard for the class for such. The 25% or more msrp difference is Hard to ignore for the 335 vs g37- (please dont argue with me - ive priced them option for option) and even the msrp for the 328 balloons to 50k. I think NyC did a great job getting the deal on a great car- and I wish him well and I hope to see him on the Merritt one day. My argument has never been the g as a better car- but a better value for a lot of the same things the BMW does. The g or Acura might never be the top pick for car and driver mag, or the ""true driver""- but in consumer reports they have consistently ranked better. An unbiased news rag with no advertising support- I think the true driver, a person who wants the true sport and performance is going to get the 335 or 328 - with sport and stick. Other then that set up these cars in this class are very close regardless of price. - "
"flightnurse","April 2012"," There is a difference between comparing two cars and mentioning cars. No were are you going to find anyone comparing a mustang (Boss 302) to a BMW. Now I would love to add the Chrysler 300C to the list, after having one for 8 days I have to say for the price you get a lot for your money. When the 8 spd auto goes into the car for MY 2013 this will be a car that will give Infiniti and BMW a run for their money... "
"sweendogy","April 2012"," I don't understand the first paragraph - but agree the chryster has made major strides in a short period. Nice job flight - your back "
"flightnurse","April 2012"," Hey Stick I agree with you to a point regarding depreciation. Price is a relative thing, if I couldn't afford a new BMW, yes, I would go for a CPO BMW, but I keep my cars longer then most, currently I have no plans on selling my 05. If I had to sell one of my BMW the 2011 is a goner. My partner hasn't made up is mind what car he wants, he was edging towards a 535i, I was sort of pushing towards a 740i (same engine with 15+ more hp.) But he started looking at used A7s he is looking at price (trying to save some money.) So who knows what we will buy, but for him price is playing a factor. "
"flightnurse","April 2012"," Sweeny the reason why you don't understand the first paragraph is simple, it was directed at you comparing a Jeep to a BMW... With the 8 spd coming to 300C, the might G will have major competition in the best bang for the buck. For under 40K the 300c will be a major player. Just as long as Chrysler doesn't program the 300c to go into ""eco"" mode so quickly even BMW will have to watch out. "
"sweendogy","April 2012"," And your back to the defensive norm- if you follow the posts my comment again was for stick guy saying the 328xi autonwas scary fast in the real world- and I responded with saying the jeep was almost as fast - but it's a jeep, thats the point -Fun odd fsct- Jeep and the c300 share the same parent - please give us updates on when to expect the 8speed auto becomes available. "
"nyccarguy","April 2012"," Kdshapiro - Thanks my man! I just love the car and cannot say enough good things about it. Haven't heard from you in a while & glad you are still here!BTW men - I turned 36 today! "
"m6user","April 2012"," Gee, didn't know Chrylser was a luxury brand. Never see it mentioned in the rags as such. Since the Chrysler 200 is the ""entry-level"" Chrysler and can have the same engine as the 300, I guess one could make an argument that the 200 should be part of this discussion. Wait, isn't that the remake of the acclaimed Sebring? That will never do.It seems like anytime someone drives a car with leather, some power and decent driving attributes they think it's ELLPS. Use some discretion folks. The 8spd is offered in the Charger. Again, leather, decent handling, 8spd tranny and good power from a v6. Should it also be ELLPS?Personally, I think there is more to being a luxury brand than nice leather. Including driving experience, styling that holds up over time, amenities, cutting edge tech, customer service, warranty, dealer experience and overall quality of components. I don't think Chrysler is there yet....maybe a couple of pieces but not the whole pie. "
"stickguy","April 2012"," happy birthday. Keep enjoying that early present.I was 36 once. A long time ago. A real long time.I have a birthday in a few weeks, but it is much more renowned than 36 (as a milestone!) "
"flightnurse","April 2012"," I love Alfa's, I had a GTV-6 for a short period, the music the engine made was so Ferrari like however, like all Italian Cars, if they are not kept up as far as service they are a nightmare to keep running. However, I would have to assume that the modern day ALfa's are not of the old, much more derivable and much less a problem. I'm for once waiting to see what the new Dart will look like in person and drive.. Hoping that National will get them as rentals I would have to give it a try. "
"flightnurse","April 2012"," I am not the one who continues to write comments about how wonderful the G is over the 3 Series. In fact your G is very dated compared to the 3 series. Your comment about dated interior and Nav in the new MY 2012 shows you do not have first hand knowledge of the car. Go buy a new G37 then talk about how wonderful it is, stop reading the mag's and coming off as an expert. "
"kdshapiro","April 2012"," NYC - thx. Life takes over. Happy birthday to you. This particular discussion is probably the best on the interwebs. Now stay out of the cops radar.  "
"kdshapiro","April 2012"," I really can't agree with your post. BMW makes the better sports sedan and has great tech. And while the g is certainly due for a refresh, it is a great car in its own right.The nav is very good, tech in the car is good. It's an acceleration monster and really hugs the road. The wood trim gives the interior a very classy look. Cup holders stink, but I love the electric telescoping steering wheel. Highway mileage is decent, trunk is roomy. I love that hids are standard. And I have all the goodies for a measly 45k. Bt integration is awesome, and the Bose is good. Non sport seats are comfortable.So while I love bmws, the g37 is not an also-ran and in almost every comparo, comes in second for good reason. I tested out the awd system during that freak October storm and I was impressed.As i started out this post, the g is a fine car in its own right. "
"flightnurse","April 2012"," Fact, I never talked about the Chrysler 200, all of my comments have been regarding the 300C.Fact, the only LX car NOT to have the 8 spd for MY 2012 is the V8 cars, whether they are Dodge or Chrysler, that will change for MY2013 when all LX cars will get the new 8 spd auto.Fact, Chrysler was the Luxury division, granted they suffered in the past, but I can state things have gotten better, and yes, they should be in the ELLPS. The feel of the leather, switches, steering, handling and the closing of the doors have a great feel to them, if you haven't driven one then it is hard to make comments about the cars. "
"flightnurse","April 2012"," Sweeny wrote, "" Fun odd fsct- Jeep and the c300 share the same parent - please give us updates on when to expect the 8speed auto becomes available.""This makes no sense, the Nissan Versa and Infiniti G37 are from the same parent too, so when we can expect the Versa to get a V6 option? "
"kdshapiro","April 2012"," Upscale vs luxury. My local Chrysler dealership is not in the same league as my local lexus dealership.Do all manufacturers who put leather seats in their vehicles belong in this discussion? "
"graphicguy","April 2012"," kd....if Chrysler slapped an Imperial badge on the 300 would that make it a worthy candidate for this discussion? Not disagreeing with you, only that, at the very least, I've heard Chrysler execs state that the 300 IS their luxury offering.flightnurse and nyc....I'm with you on the 0-60 thing. If that was the end all to beat all, then this discussion would only be about Mustang GTs/Boss/KC, Camaro SSs, Charger/Challenger RTs and 'Vettes.Then again, as we all know, nothing really competes with a G series, regardless of the parameter you use......well, except maybe a Jeep. "
"sweendogy","April 2012"," Graph and Flight- please put the BMW blinders away-- I think everyone here can agree the BMW is the best in class car-- but if you include Price its got some serious competition-- and since this is ELLPS you have(i think ive said this now 25times) to include price- 0-60 time and HP should be included as well as they are very important to the overall package-- as ive mentioned bmw has many advantages - but price is not one of them- 25% more for a car is a huge chunk to pay for a similar car-- is the premium worth it, thats the question- and in my eyes and others that are owners of LEXUS IS, G37, TL - its not. Again if you equip a 328xi maxed out its 50k-- a 335xi gets you over 55k- others top out at 42-45k-- huge diff and need to be factored in. "
"flightnurse","April 2012"," KD, then the TSX shouldn't be here either since its an accord made fancy. Or in JDM the G is far from a luxury car. Once again, have driven the new Chrysler 300c? I think I know the answer already. I dont think you have, so why are saying that the 300c shouldn't be here if you have no first hand knowledge of the current 300c? "
"stickguy","April 2012"," I thought the concept was more about the cars, but it is sounding now like the dealership is a big part of it? But to me, that is far down the list. I don't expect to spend any time there anyway (after buying it!). So if they have a clean, drive in, well organized service area, good to go! THough I guess a loaner car would be nice, but again, how much do you want to pay for that?As to the cars themselves, I would discard the 300C since it is a FS barge. And if you are including that (maybe even if not), why isn't the Hyundai Genesis included? Simply because you have to go to the Hyundai dealer to get one? "
"kdshapiro","April 2012"," I think the TSX is the classic definition of an entry level sedan within a lineup of models. While it may not have the cache, I don't see why it's not an ELLPS. Acura markets it as a sporty vehicle.No, I haven't driven the 300, but what should be litmus test for including an ELLPS in this category. It has to be more than leather seats.  "
"m6user","April 2012"," 1. I never said you mentioned the 200. I simply stated if you want to include the 300c, then LOGICALLY the 200 should also be included as that is the ""entry-level"" offering from your so called luxury car division....Chrysler.2. I realize the 8spd is only offered on the V6 now. That is why I mentioned that the 200 can have the same engine as the 300, the v6. Please read posts more carefully.If marketing jargon is the criteria for inclusion then many manufacturers would be discussed here. One doesn't have to drive every car made to know that certain manufacturers and certain cars shouldn't be included here. There are many ways to determine through magazines, auto shows, dealer showrooms, etc. and the test drive is just one factor(albeit a major factor). There are many aspects as to what makes a luxury car and carmaker and, yes, it does include the dealer experience. Go to your local Chysler/Dodge dealer and see how it compares to a BMW or Lexus dealer and honestly report which ones feel like a luxury carmaker and which one doesn't.However, everything I say is based on the premise that the cars discussed here are supposed to be from what is commonly as a luxury carmaker. If that is wrong and it just depends on any one members perception of what a luxury car is without regard to brand, size, price than I will stand corrected. "
"sweendogy","April 2012"," Good post- I especially agree that he should read the posts more carefully. "
"nyccarguy","April 2012","  Just to elaborate on pricing a little bit. If BMW didn't have this crazy factory backed lease program + $2500 rebate + making the 1st 2 payments, I'm still driving the TSX. The BMW is expensive. My 328xi had an MSRP of just over $44,000. That also includes a whole heap of standard features and ""no cost options"" BMW put in the car because it was the end of the E90's run. For comparison, my Mom's (former) 2008 328xi had less equipment than my 2011 328xi yet had an MSRP of over $46,000.When my lease is up, I'm going to have to make a decision. I'm obviously going to drive an F30 (4 cyl 3 series), but I think with similar equipment to my 2011 will be priced out of my league. The IS is going to be all new. The G37 is going to be all new. MB might get some sense knocked into it and offer the C350 with 4matic.I might not like any of these and want to buy my 2011 back from BMW or buy a similar 2011 328xi CPO with 25,000 or 30,000 miles (instead of the 50K mine will have). "
"sweendogy","April 2012"," Yeah man- I know and rooted for you to get a great deal on the search and you did. For the price you paid I think throws my cost agrument out the window- its a great deal on a well equipped car. Like you pointed out most are not going to get such a deal- I would bet the 2012 are going close to list because of the new body. Landscape should change a bit and it's going to be interesting to see what happens with this new Caddy as well- looks like a power player on paper. "
"nyccarguy","April 2012"," While I don't think other cars mentioned here should be officially added to the list here, there is no shame in discussing them. We've got a pretty steady following of regulars here and everyone's opinion is weighted equally. I know if flightnurse says the 300C is a nice driving car, he's not just talking about the fact that it has leather seats.If when my lease is up, I can get into a G37 with 100 more horsepower for $100 a month less or $50 a month less on a lease, then I'd most certainly go for it. If MB offers up the serious ""conquest cash"" that they did last year for the C - Class and I can drive one for less than my current 328xi, I'll drive a Mercedes (C350 4matic).In 30 months, I might not exclusively shop this ELLPS class either. I might dig the X1 or a CPO X3 with the N55... Who knows.For now I LOVE MY BMW 328xi! "
"sweendogy","April 2012"," I Agree that the 300c and the c300 should be mentioned, yes i agree with flight, even when he asks for my age but doesnt respond why he needs it,don't be shocked. I'm a firm believer that dealership experience means little certainly given the cars we talk about here - they should be low maintence and most are- sure some try to bait you with free maintence programs for free wipers and oil changes but most of these cars should not see the dealerships for more then a couple of oil changes for the first few years. I think the most important thing you can get from a dealer is a good deal on initial price. Flight has a point we should look further and this 300c could be a BMW competitor in the future- a value leader as he once said even thou it's classified as full size and cars to the right are midsize at best. I am not a firm believer that an 8 speed transmission means anything at all but the guy has his Performance views and I guess a strong 8 speed is one of them. I think his statement has more value then others talking about m3s or Porsches that are clearly out off the category all together. "
"kdshapiro","April 2012"," Let's not forget that Edmunds is very topic oriented, am I'm not being the forum police here. Anybody is certainly free to go to the News And Views board and create the thread of their choice to discuss whatever is related to the auto world.Don't forget all of these cars have some competition on almost every level and some marquees, e.g. Hyundai produces the genesis and equus, which some may say are luxury cars, but the dealerships don't pass the litmus test of a luxury dealership. Neither do Chrysler dealerships. Especially if one uses Lexus as the benchmark.Maybe this particular thread has outlived it's usefulness due to the changed landscape of the auto world. "
"graphicguy","April 2012"," kd....outlived its usefulness? Not so certain about that. The names may have indeed changed. But, the market segment is still alive and vibrant (luxury sport sedans/coupes).nyc....BMW does indeed discount their cars pretty heavily....especially with lease subsidies. I think I got $7K+ off on mine (including a hefty $2,500 rebate). You got almost as much off with the addition of favorable money factors and residuals.This is not distressed merchandise. They are ""best in class"" vehicles. That blunts things as far as making that financial commitment.That said, if I was staring at a ~$50K '12 328i, with a 4 cyl, with little to no discount, I'd be moving down the road into something else, for certain. I've tried to warm up to Mercedes a few times, both C and E class. I can not do it. For the life of me, I can't see the appeal....especially for the price.

I'm a car enthusiast for many decades, read C&D, and know BMW's reputation. Was quite surprised how much I didn't like the BMW. Interior was bad, very bad, looks the same for the past 10 years. Driving was nothing special, the salesman encouraged us to drive very quickly around his route which included a traffic circle as well as interstate. Just didn't do it for us. The MB handled much better and rode better and was better in every regard. We would have bought an A4 well before a BMW. It's really personal preference. We got the C350 for $43k out the door with 18's, keyless go, no NAV. Most features are standard on the 350 such as upgraded sound system. I do like the way BMWs look. There are way too many on the road now - I see more of them than Accords. The interior and driving dynamics - not so much. "

"graphicguy","April 2012"," kd....never been a CR fan. Their flaw is they tell their readership what their reliability should be, and they respond accordingly. That's why Hondas have been at the top of their lists for so long. On top of that, they only grudgingly took Lexus/Toyota off of their ""recommended"" list when they were going through the unintended acceleration fiasco. Even though Toyota was exonerated, CR had no reason to pull them from the recommended list, other than public opinion.So, if a BMW is thought to be problematic, regardless of the facts, CR rates them as such. Perception is reality is CR's world.I agree with you. I doubt CR sells many subscriptions into the BMW market.For decades, they put different values on cars than those of us in here do. In CR's world, everyone should be driving a Camry, Corolla, Civic or an Accord.I haven't read their mag in 15 years. When I did read their rag, I didn't find one thing about their ratings and opinions I agreed with. I just hear people in these sorts of threads talk about them. "
"dino001","April 2012"," Even though Toyota was exonerated, CR had no reason to pull them from the recommended list, other than public opinionToo much conspiracy theory, IMHO. It is actually much simpler. Besides acceleration fiasco, Toyota was actually going through a quality dip during mid-to-late '00. It was related to their goal of being No. 1 in sales, catching a moderate case of GMnitis, absorbing too many new suppliers too quickly and attempting too aggressive pricing cuts to meet the points (and sales quotas). The acceleration thing was just the apex of the process. Regardless whether the issue was real or imaginary (pedal was real and they kicking and screaming admitted it, electronics may have been imaginary) , CR simply noticed what people did - their new spanking Camries and Lexuses (Lexi?) were NOT as reliable as the previous ones. They had no choice, but take them off that ""automatic recommendation"" list. BTW automatic recommendation really meant that if a new model tested well enough to get positive review, they would not wait for the reliability data to recommend it, as history of previous models had a consistent track record of good reliability. Toyota simply lost that streak. There are plenty of models that have good reliability, but are not recommended due to lower score in tests and vice versa - good score, but reliability below average, or ""New/no data"". It is all consistent. One can dispute their ratings (they tend to focus things that enthusiasts simply don't care about and other items that are very important to the enthusiasts get low weight in their score), also their reliability survey method can sometimes be disputed, as well. I just don't exactly believe in conspiracy that the results are predetermined. BMW 3-series is usually ""in or out"", depending on the year, point in the cycle. They usually get top ratings in their category (so even CR likes them as ELLPS), but the recommendation is occasionally withheld, when the survey data shows consistent issues with significant repairs, regardless whether paid by the owner, or in warranty. BTW, Honda is going through similar crisis today as Toyota did in late '00. It is not related to reliability, but to overall design/quality feel. The new civic is such a flop (not in real terms, vs. expectations and competition progress) that Honda decided to accelerate the refreshing cycle. "
"dino001","April 2012"," For decades, they put different values on cars than those of us in here do. In CR's world, everyone should be driving a Camry, Corolla, Civic or an AccordThat is not entirely accurate. They place vehicles in different categories. It just so happens that small and midsize sedans are most known and followed by people, hence Camry or Corolla. They have other categories, too and occasionally test them. BMW 3-series consistently wins its own class (sporty upscale sedan) in terms of points, it even sometimes gets recommendations, which it can later lose due to reliability data. Same often happens to Passat - it very often is on top of the ratings, but it does not get recommended due to reliability. Then Camry/Accord step in, as being half-notch below, but with better record. They do not say ""you should buy ..., period"". They say, ""If you want a familly sedan below $30K, you should buy..."". Big difference.In other words, their criteria and values are not as different as yours, but they use a two-stage evaluation process. Step one is the car merrits, as what pertains to its category. You score above certain threshold, you become a candidate. Step two is reliability data. It just so happens that those darlings of ours also happen to be more prone to failures than those more hum-drum offerings of others. "

"Kirstie_H","April 2012"," CR isn't for enthusiasts. BMW drivers tend to be enthusiasts; therefore, CR isn't for BMW shoppers. I doubt anyone wondering whether they should or shouldn't get a BMW bothers consulting CR.It's more for items where there isn't a wide array of difference in performance and options - say, toasters. Toasters have one job - to turn bread that isn't toast into toasted bread. Some may do it a bit faster or more evenly, and may last longer, but that's about all there is to rate. "
"flightnurse","April 2012"," KD interesting point, however, Hyundai has an interesting approach when it comes to the Equus. If you want to look at one and are serious, the Hyundai dealer will bring the car to you whether it is at home or the office, so you don't have to walk into a dealership. If and when it comes to service, Hyundai will come and pick up the car from you, with a loaner car. Hyundai knows that if they want to be taken seriously they have to play different. I also like the fact that the Equus's owners manual are on a iPad that comes with the car. Again, thinking outside the box.I believe the Genesis is a luxury car, for Hyundai. For the size, equipment and, price they have a great product. Give then another year or two and I truly believe they will be a big player in the luxury car market. People laughed at Acrua, Lexus and Infiniti when they started and today, we have people who do nothing but praise them like they are gods. "
"ivan_99","April 2012"," I don't think there is any proof that people are filling out CR surveys as lambs...but there is no proof they are not.I think CR and even JD Powers is about as good as we can get trying to determine reliability.Which isn't very good...Let's say you have two cars MB E class and Kia Rio. I would suspect that if both experience 5 minor problems that Mr E class would note every single one. There is an expectation that once you spend a certain amount that everything should be working correctly (I also subscribe to this theory). The Rio guy didn't see the, fictional, power window switch not working as a problem...because hey...it didn't leave me stranded...and they fixed it under warranty.I would also suspect that once you start adding in ""free"" maintenance it skews the results.Then I have my couch theory that relates to demographics. Give the same couch to college dudes and grandma. After 3 years which couch is more ""reliable"". What if grandma's really liked a particular couch (wonder why Buick is so high on JD Powers...). Or why, for some reason, the Lexus GS and IS had worse than their ""normal"" reliability rating; answer: because they sell those to people like me (drive it like you stole it).Speaking of JD Powers. A while ago I compared the long term reliability from two separate periods. Conclusion: A new Audi is as reliable as a Toyota from 5 years ago...the new Toyota is even more reliable...but if 5 years ago you were ""happy"" with the number of problems per 100 vehicles...you could justify a new Audi  "
"m6user","April 2012"," Interesting point of view. How would you explain that different brands and models within change in the CR results from model year to model year? Wouldn't the people owning them have the same attributes and be reporting similarly. A MB owner wouldn't suddenly become complacent about the 5 problems and the Kia owner wouldn't suddenly become more critical. Probably no real way of ever determining and it probably works on a curve anyway. Oh well, this discussion has strayed way off topic and I'm sure people want to move on. "
"dino001","April 2012"," A MB owner wouldn't suddenly become complacent about the 5 problems and the Kia owner wouldn't suddenly become more criticalActually, they potentially could, very much so. It is a game of expectations. Doesn't mean this is the only variable, but it is important one, often not taken into account. I would add, I don't care much for JP Powers' methodology. There were several times, when I read results of their surveys vs. what I knew about the car, it became evident to me there is a lot pretending there. Case in point - Subaru Legacy. Since 2005, it had three distinct levels of trim with totally different engine performance. While standard four cylinder is so-so, the GT trim turbo is a beast, one of the fastest in the group. Yet, JP Powers would allow you to choose specifically ""GT"" trim and would still assign lower than average acceleration to it. I suspect, the surveys were not properly sorted, there was probably not enough data for separate GT trim, but JP Powers would not admit that - they'd rather give you garbage data based on averaged low-end trim line and pretend it also pertained to the higher one. Once I discovered that, it became clear to me these guys know much less than they are pretending to do. Not to mention their choices for categories, like ""harsh ride"" somehow becomes part of a ""quality"" in their ""initial"" or ""long term"" quality studies. Pure ignorance taken to extreme. "
"cdnpinhead","April 2012"," with CR survey methodology is that it's a self-selected cohort. The people who take the time to fill out the multi-page survey (IMHO) are either really upset or extremely pleased with their vehicle, or worse yet, have an axe of some sort to grind (Pious drivers, anyone?). Run-of-the-mill people who have better things to do with their time aren't included.It's anythiing but a statistically-valid survey, but no one seems to care, and here we are.Plus which, a flaw that causes the car to stop running isn't differentiated from one that's an inconvenience or a minor annoyance in a system that 99% continues to function.

"kdshapiro","April 2012"," Lexus, Acura and Infiniti set the bar in terms of dealerships. There is a Toyota and Lexus dealership in my neck of the woods, right next to one another. I cannot image the Toyota dealer selling an LS 460 out of it's showroom, which is akin to Hyundai selling the Equus next to an Elantra.Not that that is bad. But American buyers, imo, expect the dealers to walk the walk and talk the talk when it comes to luxury vehicles.I'm not sure I would be happy to have these service guys drive my car back and forth the dealership. My ex-BMW dealer had that option, but I decided not to avail myself of that particular service. "

Why was this guy selling it?I'm starting to dip into my BMW's performance potential. First and foremost I'm so impressed with how well the chassis is balanced. It pours itself around curves. The entire car is very fluid. I used to say that I'd only want a RWD 3 series with a Sport Pkg & frowned upon BMW for only offering a cosmetic sport package with AWD. Not anymore. I'm so happy with how well my 328xi drives. I don't feel the need for anything sharper & a bit lighter (Sport Pkg & RWD). I don't feel the need or want for anymore power.When I drive a car, I always try to pick a theme song for it. Something that suits the car perfectly. My Prelude's theme is ""Sunshine of Your Love"" by Cream.For my 328xi, since I'm leasing it and have to give it back in 2 1/2 years, I picked ""Stay With Me"" by Faces.

After learning about the maintenance issues and cost, I switched to the 2000 Vette I bought. Even though my vette had quality issues, it was a very entertaining car to drive...

I called him and after he told me about the car, I knew it was the one. When I took delivery, we posed for pictures together and he told me that if anything didn't meet my satisfaction, he'd buy it back from me. He even called me the next day to see how I liked it and to tell me he's glad that I bought it and that it went to a good home. It's a beauty. I drove it to Bainbridge Island today with the kids and it is TIGHT.

Unless any survey of owners is done with a gun at their head, it is self-selected. The only other method would be strictly from dealers service records since after warranty so many cars are serviced and repaired done by independent garages. That would give some good indication of initial and early troubles but wouldn't provide any long term reliability data.

I can't understand the argument that because a car costs 1/2 as much it should be half as reliable (or expectations as such should be lower).If I pay 1/2 as much I'd expect my HP and Torque, comfort, luxury to be halved, but not the reliability.

"ivan_99","April 2012"," Yes, I love the conspiracy theorists that think CR brainwashes millions of people into believing something that isn't true. I don't think it's a conspiracy (unlike the president's b-certificate  ) but I think it leads to generalizations regarding an entire manufacturer. I originally speculated that demographics (another generalization too) play a large part in the CR results (couch theory). I find it -reasonable- to assume Buick has a high reliability ranking because 'old' people aren't tearing it up like a younger person would; same with Lexus.Of course, in my case, a long time ago I had -acceptable- reliability from my Honda Civic, even though I kept that thing over 5k rpm all day...so that may prove the point that Honda is making extraordinary reliable vehicles. My IS350 isn't *super* reliable. My previous cars...my Honda wasn't as reliable as my Audi. Looking at CR...the Audi should loose that comparison every time.I overheard (eaves-dropped) the lady across the hall saying ""my car's a Honda so it'll last forever"". I thought ""really? I could break it pretty quick"". But she heard form them/they that is is reliable.As a disclaimer...I also listened to them/they when I decided on my CPO IS350 over a 335 (didn't want to deal with potential problems of a German car). If I had the few problem in a 335 I've had in my IS350 I would have thought ""see...those German cars break down, they were right"" "
"m6user","April 2012"," My IS350 isn't *super* reliable. My previous cars...my Honda wasn't as reliable as my Audi. Looking at CR...the Audi should loose that comparison every time. I think CR has a sample size a little larger than ONE. If two other peope had Audis that had more problems than your Honda would you then accept as fact that the Honda was more reliable. It's twice the sample size yours is. People do get lemons or plums and that is why a survey of several hundred or even thousands is a better indicator than your admitted speculations. Did the lady across the hall have a copy of CR in her hand? Would have made your story even funnier. "
"andres3","April 2012"," I find it -reasonable- to assume Buick has a high reliability ranking because 'old' people aren't tearing it up like a younger person would; same with Lexus. ____>>>>>>>>>>)))))))))I don't agree with those presumptions though. A decently made vehicle will stay in one piece whether you drive it like grandpa or you drive it like you stole it (as long as you maintain it properly). For instance.... My '95 Neon fell apart when it was babied, and it tore apart equally as bad when I drove it like a teenager should (:P).My friend of the same age literally raped his '95 Geo Prism (a Corolla under the emblem) day after day, from birth until he sold it at over 100K miles. While he treated his Corolla at least 10X harsher than I treated my Neon, I needed 4 tow trucks in 65K miles while his car needed zero in over 100K miles. He had zero mechanical issues (someone did break off his rearview mirror though (but that's rough housing negligence, not the cars fault).With rev limiters in Automatics... if the car can't be driven like it can be driven, then maybe the manufacturer should move the red line to 2,500 RPM???? I can't imagine any kind of driving style (short of willful attempts to destruct) hampering the life of a well made vehicle (accidents excluded).In conclusion if a car self destructs just because you don't drive it like someone over 65, then that car should be labeled as a disposable vehicle. Like a BIC disposable razor. Planned obsolesense?Another example, I've tracked my A3 several times (and driven it way harder in general than any other car I've owned, including the Neon as a Teenager). The A3 has been fairly reliable almost to the level of the Honda I owned for 65K miles (which was far from perfect, but very good; I blame Ohians for most of the issues). None of the issues with my A3 that have hit my pocket book could really be reasonably attributed to driving it ""hard,"" other than routine maintenance items like Brake pads, rotors, and tires. Costs in those areas are high when you drive it like it was MEANT to be driven.P.S. It wouldn't suprise me that much if an Audi made post 2000 was more reliable than a Honda made post 2007. Was the Honda made in the USA?; even less surprising then. Now if your Honda was made in Japan, and the Audi beat it... congratulations to Audi! But Audi is reliable enough for the last 10 to 12 years that any one good one could perhaps beat a bad Honda by a bit. "
"andres3","April 2012"," I also listened to them/they when I decided on my CPO IS350 over a 335>>>>>_______________Judging a used car is slightly unfair to Lexus? Maybe the previous owner never changed the oil, or grossly neglected the car moreso than just abuse in driving it, but abuse in lack of maintenance. CPO means little to me. You simply don't know how it was ""owned"" previously. All of the cars I've had were bought new. That is a huge variable when you buy ""used."" One of the ""risks"" you take for saving money.Also, I believe a proper break-in in the first 1,000 miles may be crucial.... If I leased a car... I probably wouldn't break it in properly, but I've always bought... so I have. "
"ivan_99","April 2012"," Yes that does make sense, my sample size is me I don't really follow CR for automobiles; there are too many variables.For comparison, you don't use your vacuum everyday, outside, in the rain/snow, in anger (some of you may), for fun, to eat on (in), over curbs, over grass, to compete with your neighbor (i'm guilty on that one); and don't have different strangers take it a part occasionally to repair/maintain it.I suppose they try to account for all variables and 'guess' the best they can.

"markcincinnati","April 2012"," I'm not exactly sure if CR is a publication that I would use as the basis for my automotive purchases. We've been down the ""CR argument"" path so many times before here on Edmunds, I would assume we don't need to go down it again. I must admit however, that I am not a subscriber but I have taken to reading CR's automotive tests and comments of late because of reading some of the posts here on Edmunds. I was encouraged to see that CR now seems to have more subjective prose (not much more, but a little more) pertaining to the cars under their review. In other words, the CR reviews I have read over the past couple of months no longer seem to have been written by a Vulcan. Indeed, the test reports and comparisons seem to have been written pretty much by actual humans.I read, here, posts that discuss ""reliability"" (one of the WORDS that needs to be used carefully) and often the poster will suggest that the reason they didn't seriously consider a German car (for instance) is that they are unreliable. The poster will continue to say that they went with the Japanese brand (they chose) because of its reliability.I know there are lemons from the US, Europe and Asia -- and I know someone will likely have an anecdote to share about how his Audi or Volvo or Buick was constantly in the shop or broke down frequently. And, often the same person will laud the absolute reliability of their fill-in-the-blank car from Japan or Korea or somewhere else.I am also going to pass along what might be considered anecdotes, but they might also be considered data points. I can't remember EVER having an unreliable car including my first POC which was a 1963 Chrysler Newport. Moreover, since my wife and I have had over 30 German cars, I can assure you we really would have to go some to claim any of them (even the ones from the 70's) were unreliable.It is very difficult to find a car today -- from anywhere -- that would be able to be called unreliable. Here, however, is another WORD that probably should enter our vocabularies and that has both a difference and a distinction -- that WORD is ""durable"" (or durability.)The issue, in my mind is not how reliable the car is -- hell, all of these cars are reliable, they won't leave you stranded, and they won't break or have anything major go wrong with them for at least 50,000 miles -- many of them will go double that before any real coin is required to replace a failed part.What I have learned -- now having about 40,000 miles experience with two Japanese cars (one Infiniti and one Acrua) is that the Japanese cars have the reputation of being durable and being able to be kept so without breathtakingly expensive maintenance, once the warranty expires. The German cars are just as reliable, IMHO, but -- after the warranty expires -- they can be breathtakingly expensive to maintain and they stand the chance of not being as durable as their Asian counterparts, or at least they are perceived to be less durable than the Asians.I am not certain what exactly CR means when they speak of the reliability of such and such brand -- for from where I sit they're all very reliable these days. I am constantly told, however, that my Acura is likely to be ""the most durable car I have ever had."" But often the WORD reliable and durable are used as if they are different words but lack distinction.Makes my head spin.Are German cars less reliable than Japanese cars? You can't make that case with me. In fact, since I have already had to have the front brake rotors on my 2012 TL turned (due to warpage) and the rear differential oil changed (at great expense, I might add) and the car only has 15,000 miles on it, I would say it is the least reliable, no, check that, least durable car I have had this century. My 2009 Audi came will all maintenance paid as did my wife's 2008 BMW -- so far the Acura and the Infiniti seem to visit the dealership for some multi-hundred dollar required ""maintenance"" procedure about every 3,750 miles.If I only were looking at cars as being reliable, I would say the Germans (Audi and BMW) would be at the top of my list since I only had to visit the dealership about once every 10 or 15,000 miles, and when I did the visit was ""no charge.""My point is we need to use the correct word to describe these cars -- and I suspect what we mean when we say ""reliable"" is ""durable.""These cars, today, are all reliable -- some, however, are more durable than others. I suspect the Germans can be as durable (as the Japanese) with breathtakingly expensive maintenance procedures applied regularly after the 50,000 initial warranty expires. But since most of these cars are leased (the Germans, most certainly), most folks get rid of the cars before durability becomes a factor.CR is best used to buy toasters, not cars, if you axe me. :confuse: "

"nyccarguy","April 2012"," Excellent post as always mark. Pretty much every car on the road today is reliable. None, especially in this class of Mid $30 to $50K cars is going to leave you stranded on the side of the road.There's always the debate about how much value there is in BMW's including scheduled maintenance as part of the car's price. Now I don't have the receipts in front of me, so I'm going from memory here. I planned on keeping my former TSX for the long haul. In the almost 50,000 miles I owned it, I changed the oil (full synthetic) 5 times. Every time I brought the car in for an oil change, I had the dealer rotate the tires. There's $500 right there. I also had to have the rear brakes replaced at 33,000 miles. I was partially reimbursed for this via a class action law suit settlement. I had to have the front rotors resurfaced. Now Im a pretty educated car guy and know that most of the ""major services"" that are ""recommended"" are unnecessary, but They aren't cheap. I wonder how many people walk into the deslership's service department and tell them that the car calls for a B1 service and get charged $250 - $300 for what amounts to nothing more than a visual check and an oil change.

"nyccarguy","April 2012"," There are some services besides oil changes that are vital & necessary for a vehicle's long term durability such as brake fluid, transmission fluid, differential fluid (why was that needed so early, btw?), coolant, & spark plugs. Remember, a dealership's service department usually makes the dealer more money than they make selling new cars. Most coolant & transmission fluid changes on Hondas are simple ""drain & fill"" procedures. The dealer can charge more money for a ""power purge"" service of these same procedures. Unless the car specifies something I mentioned above be changed or done, just tell them you'd like just the oil & filter changed. "
"m6user","April 2012"," Simply open the manual and get just the recommended service that the engineers that built your auto recommend. Dealers publish their own ""over and above"" suggested maint. items but they are just money makers and serve no real purpose to the operability or longevity of your car. I've had an Infiniti for almost 10 years(95k miles) and probably haven't spent more than a $1500 in routine maint the whole time. Oil changes are about $30-$40 and the dealer always rotated the tires for free during the original warranty period. Now Costco does it for free as part of their tire deal. That's about $150 a year and there were several years where it was just two oil changes and that was it. Total repairs to this vehicle are also under $500 although I do need a new power antenna. All in all very inexpensive except for the fact that it sucks gas. "
"dino001","April 2012"," Well, before I bought my 328, I went to the service dept. to talk what ""free"" really means. You see those ""EVERYTHING EVERYTHING EVERYTHING BUT TIRES FREE commercials all the time. Surely enough, alignment is not covered. And of course, wouldn't you do a fuel induction system cleaning. Prices? $200 for alignment and $200 for cleaning. So your ""free"" maintence visit turns into dropping over four hundred bucks for services that can be performed at third in any other place and who knows if you even need one. "
"sweendogy","April 2012"," While very long, your post did include interesting points but I do one again take issue with the toaster comment. They have available data for 10 years worth of data for each cars reliability- so the sample size is bigger then one Audi and one Acura - I agree with you that if you are looking new the first 50k in driving should be pretty worry free- plus if it's not the standard warrantee should help with the major items - and any savy person should know what's real required and recommended services and know what makes up one service. The german lease argument very true but what if your looking at a used BMW - shouldn't you look at an unbiased mag like CR (who has 10!yrs of data) to make an informed decision - or just ask a buddy who has had ONE reliable/durable audi that he owned from new ? CRs sample size - to big to ignore.(sorry for the long post) "
"carnaught","April 2012","  so far the Acura and the Infiniti seem to visit the dealership for some multi-hundred dollar required ""maintenance"" procedure about every 3,750 miles. Interesting you should mention that as the Infiniti salesman who dealt on my 2007 G35 lease admitted that the warranty would still be in effect even if the recommended maintenance (aside from oil changes) was not done. I don't know if that has changed from recommended to required.Reminds me, when I brought my '08 E-Class in for its 1yr. maintenance for $250+, not only did I get the checklist of things done, but I got a ding over the rear fender wheel opening for no extra charge :sick: .

"graphicguy","April 2012"," About the TL or G. Both good cars. Either would work. G is a bit fuel thirsty. So, that's something to consider. If you can find a used TL with SH AWD, that's the one to get. They handle superbly.Regarding maintenance, TLs really don't require more maintenance than any other Honda product. The SH AWD models require a little more, but not much more. Price for maintenance on a TL shouldn't vary much from a Honda either.BMW service.....on the one previous to my current one, I swapped out the run flats as they were horrid. The new run flats on my current 335i are much better. Aside from that, everwhthing else was covered, including brakes and windshield wipers ( the only two things that required service other than oil changes, tire rotations).I've used Costco gasoline almost exclusively in my vehicles, my son's vehicles and GFs vehicles for 10 years.

Of course, my point of reference is 2008 STI, so I may have a little skewed perception. Now almost six months and 7k miles passed and I'm still not feeling those tires being so awful. Yes, I noticed a little more noise on certain types of surface than one could expect in an entry lux car, but I'm not sure if similar performance GFTs wouldn't be the same. Those are Continentals, perhaps Bridgestones are worse, or perhaps RFTs are simply getting better. I even read that certain small punctures can even be fixed now, if one doesn't let the tire to go on zero pressure for too long (read, you get flat, you pull to the next tire store) - not sure if it's really true. People say a lot of things... "
"nyccarguy","April 2012"," We all seem to agree (I think) that BMW's free maintenance is (1) built in to the price of the car and (2) has extended intervals since BMW started including it. Wherever you sit on this, there's no doubt in my mind that it adds value. I was looking through my own 328xi's vehicle computer and found that my car will require the following scheduled maintenance:15,000 miles - oil change (within year 1)25,000 miles - front brake pads (within year 2)29,000 miles - Inspection I - major service (within year 2)30,000 miles - rear brake pads (within year 2)Now let's use that schedule and see what else I can muster up.45,000 miles - oil changeThat's it for the maintenance that is included in the cost of my BMW. 2 oil changes (at the dealership) + 1 major service + front pads + rear pads add up to something. Now not everyone does the 20K miles per year that I do, so they don't get the full value of the included maintenance.Here's where things get interesting. When my lease is up, my car is going to have 50,000 miles. I'm going to have a few choices & decisions to make.Option 1 is obviously just to turn my car in and walk away.Option 2 is to buy my car (from the dealer, not BMWFS) after the lease is up & hopefully be able to negotiate a price that's significantly cheaper than the lease end buy out of a little more than $26K. Say I can buy it for $21K it would be a nice used car. If I buy the car, I wouldn't go for the CPO warranty (on my previous X3 they wanted $3K to certify it), but I most certainly would go for the extended maintenance pkg that covers the maintenance up to 100K miles. IMO, even at the $2K MSRP (think I could maybe get it cheaper), it will get me:50,000 miles - Front Brake pads (& maybe rotors)60,000 miles - Inspection II (major service incl oil, filter, brake fluid, trans fluid, coolant)75,000 miles - Oil Change90,000 miles - Inspection I (semi-major service)I'd also be financing the buyout.Option #3 is to lease another car. There most likely won't be these crazy incentives on the F30 328xi that were on my car, so I'm sure a lease with the same parameters (20K miles per year) is going to be upwards of $650 - $675/ month which is too rich for my blood.Option #4 would be to buy a similar car to mine that has literally 1/2 the miles. My only problem with that is dealers seem to have high asking prices on loaded up, off lease, CPO cream puffs. I'll see what happens. For now I Love this freakin' car! "

"nyccarguy","April 2012"," That's part of the Inspection I & Inspection II services "
"dino001","April 2012"," Glad somebody else agrees with me on that. You probably have all-seasons on yours (xi gets summer tires only with M-pack, IIRC), which should be a little more gentle anyway. One drawback on the sports/M-packs are staggered size tires, which basically means the can't be rotated (the tires are also unidirectional). This basically creates a potential for more alignment needs than in normal car. However, tires can also be replaced only 2 at the time, if one is worn more than the rest due to some misalignment issues.Anyway, I think that alignment stuff not being part of the ALL, ALL, AND ALL (BUT TIRES) FREE is kind of baloney on part of BMW. I understand that car may never need alignment, and it is a function of road hazard, but knowing general condition of roads and overall risk, it is quite common to check it once in a while. Why can't it be a part of Inspection I, beats me. If you advertise that there is nothing, but gas and tires, than it should be just that  . "
"stickguy","April 2012"," I'm betting my daughters entire college fund on option #3. "
"stickguy","April 2012"," in the big scheme of things, an alignment is chump change. Just go to a reputable tire shop, and have it done. Heck, normally it is free to check (though they always find at least 1 # out of spec!) But it only coasts about $75 to do it. I have the 3 year plan for my van, and that was only about $125 with a coupon, and I can have it redone every 6 months for 3 years, so average it out and I am paying about $20 per alignment (and just have it done when the van is in for the free rotation and balance that came with the tires).

"nyccarguy","April 2012"," Stickguy - I don't know. To me leasing is only worth it if the manufacturer subsidizes it with a ridiculously high residual (like my wife's former '07 X3 @ 65% after 3 years/45K or my current 328xi @ 64% after 30 months/50K) or an insanely low money factor. Don't forget I was also able to take advantage of a $2500 rebate which allowed me to buy the car way under invoice.If I were to finance, it would cost me $120 per month more ($3600) + with the amount of driving I do, I'm guaranteed a residual value of 64%. 2 1/2 or 3 years down the road if I were to trade the car in, no way the dealer is going to give me $26K for the car, especially when there are similar cars out there (thousands) with 1/3 to 1/2 the amount of miles. No way I'm going to justify a mid to high 6 hundred something lease payment. It's simply too much.Don't forget, this car payment isn't my only one. I'm on the hook for the Pilot until May 2016. "

"mvs1","April 2012"," Have you looked at the 2011s? A little more than a year ago when I leased my335i xdrive sedan w/ m-sport + most every other option space gray over black interior there was one east of the Mississippi. I worked for about a month to find it at my price. Fast forward a rare car new being in the condition you'd accept used and I'd call that nearly impossible. Right now I plan on buying my lease out if all things stay the same reliability wise and I'm scheduling in a visit to the dealer to explore a Dinan upgrade. "
"mvs1","April 2012"," The option I choose on my m-sport equipped xdrive was buying dedicated winter tires and just swapping out the summers. The winter set which are OEM wheels and run flats cost me $1200 locally (about half the dealer quoted price). I spend $15-20 each swap twice a year at a local shop. I doubt I'll need to replace my tires on either set over my lease since I'll put maybe 15k miles on each over the duration. Down the line, I either have a second winter set for my next 3er or sell them on EBay for what I paid. "

"flightnurse","April 2012"," So last Tuesdays I received a phone call from my boss at 1130 am. The conversation went like this.Boss: Hey how are things going at X hospital. FN: Great, training is going well, we have 3 of 12 modules built, and we are ahead of schedule.Boss: Good news, how does Miami sound?FN: Humid (pause), why (I was afraid to ask, as I knew the answer)Boss; your favorite Physician has an emergency; he crashed his EMR (Electronic Medical Record program) about an hour ago. FN: (cringe) gawd, not again. I wish he would stop playing with the EMR. (This guy makes more money than god, and he is a tech junkie. He tries and &#147;enhances&#148; his EMR and most of the time he crash&#146;s it.)Boss: Well you know the drill, when will you be able to get down there?FN: Give me an hour to book my flights and everything, and pack up here.Boss: Great?.Fast forward?Arrive in Miami to a nice 83 degree day with 55% humidity. Now being someone who has lived in a very low humidity environment, anything over 20% is horrible. Phoenix is usually between 3-5% 90% of the year, it&#146;s a dry heat. However, when in Miami one must drive a convertible. So when I arrive at the car rental, I asked the Emerald Isle agent, so what do you have as far as convertibles? Agent rattles off BMW 650i, MB E class, Porsche Boxster, Infiniti G. Stop right there, I&#146;ll take the Infiniti G, have to say it was breathtaking, Color Vibrant Red (think Jessica Rabbit red) with Wheat Leather Interior, it was a 2012 MY, the car was fully loaded.Fast Forward?.After 9 hrs of working on this Physicians EMR, I was done by 3pm Wed afternoon. So with no work for the rest of the week, what was I to do. I called my partner to see if he can get away from work, which he could, burned of FF miles on him, he arrived in Miami Thursdays afternoon, and off to Key West for a mini vacation. So with the drive down and back, it gave me a good idea on how well the G convertible drove. Have to say, I was impressed with it, the seats were comfortable, ride was well controlled, the 7 spd transmission was perfectly suited for the car. Not much wind was buffed in the cabin with the top down; the top went down fairly quickly, same with the top going up. So over all I liked the car, the color combo was smashing, very elegant, oh MPG, we averaged 25 on the whole trip.Now regarding Key West, what a place? A great get away?FNNow back to our regular tiff about how overpriced BMWs are and how everybody should be driving Infiniti G&#146;s and how the TSX should not be included in the ELLP? "

"nyccarguy","April 2012"," I agree that the G37 Convertible is a sharp car! Sweendogy - Any particular reason you're looking for a 335 xi w/ sport or M Sport pkg? Only reason I ask is because BMW's Sport Pkg & M Sport PKG on AWD cars differs from the corresponding RWD cars. You still get the bigger (very cool btw) 18"" wheels, the rear diffuser (M Sport), the black trim around the windows, the awesome sport seats, but you DO NOT get the upgraded sport suspension. I have to say that Im very happy with the more than capable base suspension set up of my 328xi. "
"sweendogy","April 2012"," I think the front end- rear end and sport seats are the big draw along with the available 6 speed- I figure if I'm going to go to the dark side - it should be equipped the way I like- the whole sports suspension thing- at this point in my life is a non-event. "
"nyccarguy","April 2012"," I completely understand. Just curious. Me too. The Sport Seats are awesome. My car has the standard seats.You'll like the dark side:) "
"kdshapiro","April 2012"," What convinced me to go with the G as my next ride was a week rental in Az. After 1500 miles I knew it was the car I would like to drive next.

"flightnurse","April 2012"," The added items, front and read dams, M sport seats, and bigger wheels are well worth the added price, however, I wouldn't want a BMW with Sport Suspension if I lived in the NorthEast, the roads are not kept up as well and the pot holes will wish you did't get the sport package... "
"flightnurse","April 2012"," This rental didn't give me the , OMG I have to have this car vibe. Even though the color combo and Options were what we liked, I'm not sold. Now as Sweeny pointed out James Healy reviewed the Passt TDI, so we went and test drove two of them today. "
"nyccarguy","April 2012"," Granting you permission to go off topic & let the group know what you thought about the Passat TDI.*Note, I don't wish the Passat to be added here, just curious as to what FN thought of it "
"flightnurse","April 2012"," So my partner read James Healey reviews on USATODAY and liked what he read, so today we went and test drove two Passt's, both were TDI models, one was a SEL Premium and SE w/Nav and Sunroof both had the DSG transmission. Let me just say, that the Passt does not qualify as a ELLPS, price wise the SEL fits, however the luxury part it falls very short. The ride is very busy, hard to put a finger one it, but it does not have the German feel that the old passt had. That DSG transmission is incredible, the shift at lighting quick, when places in sport mode, it holds the gear like one would except to hold it . However, the DSG has some jerky moments at low speed, almost like it is caught off guard driving slow, the max torque comes on at a very low 1750 which if you are not careful you will light the tires off leaving a light. Zipping around town the little 2 liter is hard pressed to know it is a diesel, no clatter, no smoke, no turbo lag.. Now VW does have a higher HP version of the 2 liter in Europe, which would fit better in the Passt, merging onto the freeway can be a chore but once you are at 65 mph zipping up to 80 is not a problem, and cruising a long at 80 the car has a very relaxed feel. Fit and finish is first rate, we were impressed with that, the wind noise that Healey complained about we did not hear, so maybe VW fixed the problem. The front seats are very comfortable lots of room up front, now the rear leg room will rivial an S class and or A8, I had no problems crossing my legs in the bad, head room was a little short for me, but livable. Overall I have to say, we both liked the Passt, but at 33K and the dealers are not dealing on them, not too sure if it is the right car for us. Now going to the web site http://www.myturbodiesel.com/ is loaded with information on the VW TDI and DSG transmission. I think VW has a winner on their hands, yeah it is Motor Trends Car of the Year, fix the ride, add a sport package and have diesel come down in price, then we might buy one.Having read peoples true world MPG, it is not uncommon for people to get better then what the EPA post for the TDI, so almost 50 on the highway is not uncommon. According to VW a Passt TDI can travel 795 miles on a tank on the highway... "
"flightnurse","April 2012"," Check in South Florida if you want a used 335, according to BMW more 335i are sold in the Miami area then any other part of the country. You might be able to find what you are looking for, then you have a good reason for a nice drive home... "
"nyccarguy","April 2012"," He needs AWD which he will not find in South Florida. "
"nyccarguy","April 2012"," I've heard the TDI's are hard to come by & that dealers aren't giving much of a discount. Even at 50 mpg highway, is it worth paying sticker or taking a nice discount (and possibly special lease & finance rates) on the same car with the VR6? "
"flightnurse","April 2012"," NYC end though AWD isn't needed in So.Florida you would be surprised on how many are sold in Miami.. "
"nyccarguy","April 2012"," There's a lot of people up here that have places down there. They buy the cars in FLA & keep em registered & insured there because it is much cheaper. Or maybe the cars themselves are cheaper because SOuth Fla is a huge market for luxury cars.My best fruend's parents have a place in Boca Raton. He went to visit them & went with his Dad to drop off their GL 450 for service. He said every single car in the showroom was Black/Black with 4Matic. "
"graphicguy","April 2012"," flightnurse...over the years I've tried to ""like"" the G. It's not that they are insufficient in any way. It's more like, as you alluded to, I won't spend my own money on one. It's never been like there was one glaring thing I didn't like about them, but there were several small, niggly things about them that didn't appeal to me. Maybe since Nissan is bringing out a new Altima, that will trickle ""up"" to the G and I might be more inclined to give the G another shot.Don't ask me why, but I've never liked diesels, probably never will. Whatever you gain in MPG is more than offset by the higher prices for diesel fuel. So, no desire for any sort of diesel....let alone one of the VW variety.Personally, I can't see anything current, or on the foreseeable horizon that would make me want to jump in the driver's seat for a test drive.BTW.....you drive much more interesting rental cars than I do. Mine are Impalas, Malibus, Altimas, Corollas, Kias, Fusions, etc. I should probably stay loyal to one rental company, however. At least I could give them a reason to put me in one of their premium sleds to use as a free upgrade.I jump from one to the other, though. Very little loyalty to any of them. Although, I probably use Enterprise more than the others. Might throw some business to Hertz this year to see what they'll do for me. "
"flightnurse","April 2012"," NYC funny you say that, I like the VR6, but the engine doesn't get the mileage that the people who are looking at the Passt want. The biggest draw to the passt is the TDI. VW is marketing the TDI as the hybrid alternative, that was told to us 3-4 times. Also if you look at the Toyota Pruis line of cars, the Prius V fully loaded is 30K, and the EPA rated the V lower then what the real world people are getting with the TDI.It will be interesting to see what VW does with the passt, right now you can lease a Passt S for $205/m for 36/months with ZERO down... Talking about leases currently the Jetta and Passt TDI residual is at a whopping 58% but I coldn't get the money factor out of the dealer unless I filled out an credit app. So I'm betting the money factor is on the high side. "
"flightnurse","April 2012"," NYC there you go, you can take the person out of the Northeast, but you can't take the northeast out of the person... Now when I was in Miami, if the car was a MB or Audi they were black, if they were Porches turbos it was either white or yellow, if they were lambo's ( saw 7 of them) they were Red, white or lime green. Sweeny should check Chicago area dealers as well as Detroit what a way to get accustomed to your new car then on a road trip home. "
"andys120","April 2012"," A similar phenomenon prevails in the metro Phoenix area where perhaps half of the BMWs are black (including my 3er convertible), so are a lot of Benzes (not so much the Audis). "
"flightnurse","April 2012"," Graphic you have some valid points.Graphic go test a drive a TDI just for fun, I would love to know what you think since you aren't a diesel fan, my partner was just like you, didn't like them didn't want one. But after reading about them and all the praises they have gotten, he is a believer. Now you bring up a good point, cost of fuel, here in Phoenix the cost difference between Regular and Diesel is about .40, and between premium and diesel is about .20. Now the diesel will get roughly 35% better mileage then gas engine car, so basically in the long run, you will save money with the diesel if you keep it at at least 50K miles.I think one of the biggest draw back to the G is the interior, the first Gen RWD car didn't have the upscale look that it needed. The second gen RWD G again, the interior didn't have the wow factor to it. Regarding rental cars. The company I work is a very large global company and we have a special account with National. So the price of the car's are at a very heavy discount. I'll give you an example.. When I was in San Diego a couple of weeks ago, the 300C cost me $93 total for two days, now this includes full coverage insurance. If I rented the same car with out the work discount, would have been $199. National has a great deal, join their Emerald club (it is free) and rent mid-size or higher and when you get to the airport you choose your car and drive off for the mid-size price. I have found that they are mid range in price, I had done the Alamo, Thrifty, Dollar but the customer service is horrible and they try and nickel and dime you when you return the car. Currently I have twenty five free rentals I need to use this year or will loose them. Airlines I have stopped flying UA all together, and book most of my travels on US. I throw AA some bones once in a while (my flight to miami) "
"flightnurse","April 2012"," I think color has a lot to do with people perceived is luxury. Are these BMW and MB 3 and C class or are they 7 and S class cars? "
"andys120","April 2012"," All of 'em, 3ers, 5ers, Xers, 7ers. Same with Benzes. I think you're right about the perception of luxury and black but back East I hardly ever see a black Bimmer, they're generally, silver, grey, red or blue. "

"sweendogy","April 2012"," Not that this has to do with anything- And I don't know prices of the Toyota hybrid but for under 30k u can get a VW tdi- seams like a pretty cool deal- bigger car and better mileage - plus I would try to run the tank 800 miles- which would mean I would have to fill up 8 times a year - pretty cool. I've actually done a little research and have noticed the mags like the car and say to go with the manual - and I can tell you the vw does manuals (not Acura crisp- but very good)Let's save the manuals - screw the whales. "
"flightnurse","April 2012"," Sweeny the 800 miles per tank is highway miles only. But if you go to the web site I posted, you will people real world mileage and 800 is a realistic range.

Automatic: 30/40/34.James also talks of the tHe tranny&#149;The car ""creeps"" too aggressively in stop-go traffic. To improve mileage, the VW automatic lacks the fluid-filled torque converter (hence, ""dry clutch"") that allows a conventional automatic to ease ahead slowly, smoothly, gently in bad traffic, but burns extra fuel doing so.I'm sure the dsg is a fine component but I'll take the manual- "

"nyccarguy","April 2012"," I think the TDI is a fantastic alternative to a hybrid (I'm no where near sold on the added expense & complexity).

"andres3","April 2012"," Spring Mountain is a great venue in Pahrump, NV. I'd like to get out to Willow Springs sometime.AS to durability vs. reliablity. I think that guy Mark has it all confused.He's talking about maintenance costs (or lack thereof because of prepaid plans; whether built-in or added). Maintenance costs have nothing to do with reliability or durability. Reliability issues come from Chrysler using corroded metals and wires for starter cables, batteries, and terminals. Other issues come from faulty O2 sensors, fuel pumps, O-rings, head gaskets, automatic transmissions that can't go 70K without being rebuilt, parking brake problems, rattles, short-lived belts, AC compressors that can't last 40K.Reliability issues are things that I have to pay for when I bought a Dodge but never had to pay for when I bought a Honda (and not because of a prepaid built-in maintenance plan aka BMW)!. I had to get brake pads and rotors for both, so that doesn't count. There's just a million things and parts that break down on a domestic product that never seem to be an issue in my Japanese and German experiences. "

"abacomike","April 2012"," I've owned/leased many German and Japanese sedans, i.e. Lexus, Infiniti, BMW, Audi and Mercedes, and have found Japanese ergonomics (interior design) to be more ""techy"", roomier and busier than German automobiles. On the other hand, I have found that German vehicles (ergonomics) less ""flamboyant"", more ""earthy"", more functional and easier to master!This opinion is based upon yearly new car purchases. Even when comparing German to German vehicles, BMW is a sporty luxury vehicle as is Audi while I've found Mercedes to be a luxury sport sedan. I currently own a 2012 E350 sport sedan and find it more ergonomically satisfying than the other German entrants. But Lexus is a bit more ""relaxed"" while Infiniti is a bit ""stiffer"" ergonomically! I would compare Infiniti more closely with BMW and Audi - than with Mercedes or Lesus. In fact, Lexus is in a class by itself as is Mercedes - each quite different ergonomically from Audi, BMW and Infiniti.I truly enjoy the Mercedes interior and refinements and find its ergonomics to be somewhat of a cross between the subtler Lexus and the stiffer BMW-Audi-Infiniti.Let's face it - all entrants here have successfully enjoyed gains in US market-share. The reason is that each attracts followers of different needs and desires.Just thought I'd share some thoughts and experiences. "

In fact the current Passt weights less and has better CD then last Gen passt so the current car would get better mileage. Not too sure why this is tough for you to understand. "
"dino001","April 2012"," That's not entirely accurate. TDI trade mark has been around for years, but the current engine is quite new. Until 2009 or so VAG was using completely different technology on their diesels, based on pump-injection device. It was a 4-cylinder 1.9 l - crude, noisy, but very stout and durable. Their current TDI is 2.0 l uses common rail technology, more modern indeed, but its durability is not as impressive. It is also more expensive to maintain. "

"abacomike","April 2012"," Thanks! BMW's manufacture great cars. I just had a very bad experience with 2-2008 535i's. So I gave up on BMW. It was electrical issues on 2 brand new535i's that had the same problems. The 3 series are great cars. Enjoy! "
"graphicguy","April 2012"," Mercedes makes good ones, too. You've found a line you know and enjoy. Stop by here from time-to-time. Would like to read some of your insights. "
"abacomike","April 2012"," After retiring from Public and Private School Administration, I moved to Florida to take care of my ailing parents. I got a job selling Lexus and then manager of an Infiniti Store. I have found that Mercedes manufactures, designs and engineers the most trouble-free sedans in both their C and E class lines. I've owned 7 E Class Sedans and have never, ever had any of them in to the service department for repairs, issues, or anything, except oil changes.I doubt it is just ""luck"". Not after experiencing BMW 5 series issues with two identical cars with identical electrical issues, both manufactures in Germany and shipped here in the same year, 2008.I found that Infiniti is most closely alligned with BMW in terms of ride and handling and power along with Audi. Lexus seems to be in a class by itself, as is Mercedes. I do not compare Mercedes to BMW, Audi or Infiniti due to the ride and handling differences.Finally, Mercedes E Class Sedans and Coupes are equipped with a 302 horsepower powerplant and fuel economy over 30 mpg hwy.In summary, Audi, BMW, Lexus, Mercedes and Infiniti manufacture outstanding vehicles. Each one is just a little different from the other - enough so that they attract a large segment of the driving public. The only think BMW has over the other brands in this category is free total maintenance which saves the driver about 300-600 dollars a year, depending upon when a car is due for brakes, etc. Otherwise, I rate the entire segment mentioned above as outstanding value for the dollar. "
"nyccarguy","April 2012"," Thanks for posting your insights here. I very much appreciate it. Have you checked out the Stories From The Sales Frontlines thread here? We'd love to hear some of your sales stories over there.What do you think of the new C250 & C350 and the outgoing C300 (which they still sell with 4Matic here in the northeast)? "
"abacomike","April 2012"," I spoke with Mercedes, and they told me that they are trying their best to increase mpg's across the line as they will not meet federal mandates in 2 years if they don't start now.They are phasing out the C300 (4 matic is sold down here only, as you know, so it is almost impossible to get a C300 down here in FL) and increasing the lines mpg's with the C250 and the higher horsepower, higher fuel efficient C350.Also, very shortly they will be expanding their ""engine shut down at stops for longer than 30- secs"" which they claim will increase mpg's by 20% throughout their line. When you stop for more than a few seconds at a light, the engine shuts down automatically. It starts up immediately when the accelerator is depressed. Much like those propane golf carts in the mountains.Mercedes missed the boat by not coming out with a diesel hybrid, in my opinion.And thanks, I will check out the Sales Frontlines Thread. I sold new cars and managed two dealerships, and you wouldn't believe the stories I have. I began writing them down as I want to write a book about my experiences.thanks again "

"nyccarguy","May 2012"," Flightnurse made a comment to me a few weeks back about me getting to see what my 328xi's AWD system can do in the rain. Now I've always really questioned AWD's effectiveness in the rain, thinking of it as more of a useful tool for snow traction. Unless BMW's XDrive is so transparent that I don't know how well it is working. Kind of similar to my Prelude's ATTS. I really didn;t know how good it was until I drove my TSX around some of the same tight corners and the front tires were fighting the stability control whereas my Prelude pulled around the corner.One of the benefits to having to be at work at 7:30 AM (6 days a week) is there aren't too many cars on the road when I leave my house at 6:30 AM. It started pouring early this AM (my 3 year old woke up with a 102 fever and a stomach virus well before 5), so the roads were saturated with lots of nice puddles in addition to being slick. I put my 328xi through the paces on my way to I 95. Only a few times when I had the transmission in DS was I able to break traction only to have the stability control tuck me back into place. So I don't know how the AWD performed. Maybe some of you with the 335xi or sween's G35X can comment how the AWD works in the rain. I can tell you that driving down I 95 in the torrential rain, my 328xi was sure footed and rock solid. I looked down at my speedo and saw I was going 80 without breaking a sweat.In the dry, gorgeous, spring weather we've been having, I've been able to hit the magical triple digit mark during passing maneuvers. Unless you are a torque junkie (not that there's anything wrong with that), my 230 hp is just perfect for public road consumption.5 1/2 weeks and over 2300 miles. As you can tell, I'm one happy BMW driver! "
"sweendogy","May 2012"," My car in the rain- when new great- new brakes, tires and new wipers - rock solid as NYC said of his new 3. Now the 07 has 30k miles- brakes are 8k old, original tires and newer cheepo wipers - not great- I'm very careful in the rain when around others so no real troubles but i know the limits of what i can and should do. Raining this am, 6 am - private road, I gave the g a little toss into a turn with some gas, dsc off I was able to wiggle the back loose. - pretty cool but again something I would not do around other cars. "
"nyccarguy","May 2012"," You made an excellent point sween. Tires! I forgot to mention tires! The single most important thing when it comes to traction. My Continental RFTs only have 2300 miles on them. "
"sweendogy","May 2012"," Rft - would like to know how they grip at 30k "
"nyccarguy","May 2012"," Stick around (no pun intended) & you'll find out in about 17 months. "
"stickguy","May 2012"," What kind of mileage are you getting on the 328 so far? Just curious. "
"nyccarguy","May 2012"," I'm getting between 20 & 21.5 right now. My engine is still green & I seriously have a hard time keeping it under 80 mph on the highway. This week I'm really trying to take it easy. Set the cruise between 60 & 65 when I can, shut the car off at long lights (says to do this in the manual). I'll report back in a few days. Some of the 335 guys have been reporting better mileage figures because even though their cars are more powerful, that power moves the weight of the car easier. "
"qbrozen","May 2012"," I've gotten as low as 23 (well, OK, was much lower than that during my track days) and as high as 26 in the 135 thus far. "
"graphicguy","May 2012"," Q....not tracking my car, but my MPG has settled in the same range, although I'm closer to 22MPG in town. Probably a low of 20 MPG ate one point, but that included nothing but driving in congested city traffic.Got 30 MPG once on all interstate over Easter. But, that's with cruise on 70 and no traffic.Usually, I'm right around 26-27 MPG with interstate driving. Who needs a 4 cyl? "

"graphicguy","May 2012"," One other thing, the MPG computer in the BMW is really accurate. It's usually within + or - .1 MPG of my manual calculations.ray.....I never drive as if I'm trying to maximize MPG.Given the MPG I'm getting plus the muscle car acceleration my 3 offers, I'm real happy. "
"nyccarguy","May 2012"," I've actually noticed that too. The MPG on the trip computer is very accurate. On my former TSX, the trip computer was always more generous than my actual mileage (same with my wife's Pilot). "
"nyccarguy","May 2012"," Is on everybody's mind. I'm sure most of you guys are the car gurus of your circle of family, friends, co-workers... like I am. We all drive performance oriented vehicles. People used to say: ""Wow, that thing must be a rocket"" or ""How's it drive?"" Now people are so obsessed with gas prices, the first words out of their mouth are: ""Is it good on gas?"" or ""What kind of gas mileage do you get?"" "

"graphicguy","May 2012"," M package is seperate from performance package. One does not include the other. Performance Package is only available via the dealer. But, I've never asked any independent shop if they could do it. "
"graphicguy","May 2012"," I have 9K miles on my 335i xDrive. Through one Fall, one Winter, and now one Spring, I really haven't noticed xDrive intervene once. And, I'm constantly flinging my car around in the wet, and none too slow either.I consider that a good thing that I don't notice it.I think I only had SH AWD in my previous TL intervene twice. Both times it was wet. Both times I was pushing the limits.While I'm still not a fan of RFTs, the current ones (Continental) are worlds better than the ones on the '06 330i (Bridgestone). "
"stickguy","May 2012"," I think in my Volvo, the performance pack upgrade would involve switching to a bigger squirrel for the treadmill. "

"
"flightnurse","May 2012"," my 2011 I'm getting 22MPG combined, my 05 I'm getting 22 combined also. Now on the freeway, my 05 gets 29. Now remember that the ZPH cars have a close ratio 6 spd tranny and lower read gears. I usually set the cruise at about 75. I haven't taken the 2011 on a freeway trip yet, heck I only have 4K miles on it too. "
"flightnurse","May 2012"," Ok so last weekend we test drove two 335d's, both 2011, one was new, one was a CPO, the CPO had 7K miles on it. The CPO was fully loaded, the new one mildly optioned. First off, WOW, it has been a while since I have had 400+ Lbs of torque. I can see having to replace the rear tires often on it. The 335d drives like a typical 3 series, sure footed, solid feel, vault like. The CPO had the sport package, so the rear tires are wider then the fronts. Over all very impressive, both cars drive well, of course the non sport packaged car road a little smoother, but nothing to deter us from not getting it. Over all, very impressive, the MPG is better then my 2011, not too sure if the added price is worth the mpg difference. Now on a side note, when we came back from the last test drive there was a couple looking at my 2011 (thinking it was for sale.) It seems the guy been looking for a 328i with the M Sport Package with a manuel and he can't find one. Now if BMW would bring the 3.5l d in the 5 series, then we would have been sold on the car. "
"sweendogy","May 2012"," 328 m pack with the manual- very select car in sedan form. "
"nyccarguy","May 2012"," Well, after driving 340.6 miles using just over 15.5 gallons of Premium I averaged just over 21.9 mpg. This is using the cruise a lot to keep the car at 60 - 65 (feels like its crawling), and shutting the car off at long lights. Tomorrow AM it will be back to driving the BMW like I only have it for another 28 1/2 months:) "
"sweendogy","May 2012"," Are you the same guy arguing why thr tsx should be in this category a few months ago? "
"nyccarguy","May 2012"," Yup, that's me:)The TSX was a mighty fine automobile, but my BMW is just on another planet. Besides my brief drive in a G37X (which was very entertaining to say the least), I haven't driven anything other ELLPS lately. It's like trying to put Trevor Hoffman & Mariano Rivera in the same category. "
"dino001","May 2012"," Really? I get 23-24 mpg not even trying to hard on my daily commute (65% highway at 60-80 mph, 35% city). On interstate at 75-85 mph I get 28-29 mpg. Even in Germany, going 90-100 mph (normal cruise speed there if you don't want to be pushed to truck's lane), I got around 23-24 mpg. It is really amazing how they were able to achieve such high mileage on the highway with that six.The mileage admittedly plummets to 18-19 mpg if I do all-city driving. This batch you drove must be a lot stop-and-go, if you got that trying so hard. BTW, I'm glad you like deep sea blue. I do to, I got one  Actually, it was my third choice. I wanted crimson red, but they discontinued it for 2012 wagons, so they did with montego blue (a little brigther). But when I saw my car on the pedestal in Munich, I immediately fell for it and forgot about my first choices. One downside - you can see every dust particle on it . I don't like washing my car this frequently, my previous cars were less susceptible to show the dust than this one. "
"nyccarguy","May 2012"," Don't forget my 328xi sedan (AWD Automatic) is hauling around some extra weight compared to your 328i sports wagon (RWD Manual). I think even in dry conditions, my car is sending 5% of it's power to the front wheels. My car is only rated at 25 mpg. Your wagon also has the sport suspension which lowered ride height helps with better mileage.You've got excellent taste in colors. My wife's (2 cars ago) 2007 X3 was Montego Blue. It was gorgeous. She got tons of compliments on it. It did show every little spec of dust, almost as bad as a black car. Every time we see a Montego Blue X3 or 3 series, she gives me the ""HMMMPH"" and ""The Look"" because her Acura TSX was black followed by her Pilot which is Polished Metal Metallic (the Bali Blue only came with Grey Leather on the EXL NAV).If I were to factory order my car from the factory Id most likely get Deep Sea Blue. The Crimson Red & Sedona Red are nice colors too.With my 328xi, it was a leftover & I was more concerned with options (Xenon NAV) than colors (as long as it wasn't black). "
"graphicguy","May 2012"," Actually, not to be misleading, but the performance package (335i) can be set up at the dealer....OR, if you order from the factory, it will be delivered with your car already installed.It was like that for the '11s. Not sure about the '12s. "

"flightnurse","May 2012"," Yes it does, is this car at a BMW dealer? If not, take the VIN # to a local BMW and have them print off the service history for you, it will give you the dealers name in which the car was serviced at.

"dino001","May 2012"," The difference is 335is has SMG, which would make big difference vs. traditional automatic. "
"sweendogy","May 2012"," Yeah my comment was from last nov -'Ive re-read it since- thanks for pointing it out thouGuess I was thinking about those leader ads you liked to mention at the time- got me sideways "
"sweendogy","May 2012"," Not a BMW dealer- just a used car dealer. I called tHe bmw dealer where the car was bought and serviced - they would not give details as I am not the registered owner. "
"robbieg","May 2012"," So, are we going to replace the CTS with the ATS when it arrives? Just saw the prices. Too close to the 3 series for me. The base engine package seems to compete with the TSX. Rightly or wrongly, if I was buyying a Caddy instead of a BMW I want a big discount. To me Caddy is closer to Acura in price than it is BMW. "
"sweendogy","May 2012"," I don't know the specifics on the ats and its pricing but I agree some discount needs to apply if they are going to be a real threat to the 3. Would love to see what fully optioned out car would be- the maxed out 335 gets to 55k pretty quickly- "
"flightnurse","May 2012"," AH, I was not aware of this, yes the SMG would make a big difference. "
"m6user","May 2012"," If you don't know the pricing, how could you say some sort of discount needs to apply? :confuse: The V6 with 300+ hp starts at about $42000. Now if it is decked out with much of the stuff that is optional on the 328 like leather, etc, etc, etc. It may already be a value proposition. The base starts at about $33000 and only has the 200 hp. This is probably going to be for people that like a small Cadillac but don't need all the go-go. Again, how decked out ""base"" cars will be is the question that hasn't been answered by GM yet. If a 270hp 2.0 ATS has enough standard it may still undercut BMW(apples to apples options) so heavy discounting may not be necessary.No real test drives have been done either so if those turn out to be very good and the pricing is right it may be very competitive. Since we don't have any idea of the standard equipment that goes along with the different engine price points it's kind of silly to be making definitive statements at this point in time. "
"sweendogy","May 2012"," Well if both cars are equipped the same at the start - and they both are around the same price then BMW would win because well it's a BMW- and since caddy saying this is a 3 series fighter they would need more for less. See g35-g37- similar performance 10k diff in price. If they were priced the same Infiniti would sell fewer cars - pretty simple if you ask me.The details for pricing on edmunds - posted today do not include any options or standard features - so we have no real clue on how to compare these cars. "
"m6user","May 2012"," so we have no real clue on how to compare these cars. \Ummh, that was my point. How can one say the ATS would have to be discounted until we do know the details? The base ATS may have standard that which you might have to pay thousands for on the 328. I agree, BMW has the pinache and history, so if they were very(you're never gonna get exactly) similarly equipped the ATS would have to be at a lower price point or be discounted like you said. "
"nyccarguy","May 2012"," As much as I'd love to have you as part of the BMW ownership brotherhood on our board here, I'm sure whatever they are asking for that 335xi with the new manual transmission isn't exactly cheap. So I'd pass on this & keep looking if I were you. "
"sweendogy","May 2012"," Thx you. I have decided to pass- Maybe ill look at the ats/  "
"flightnurse","May 2012"," GM needs to get the ATS right the first time for it to be competitive in the market it will compete in. It will be interesting to see what happens, it took the CTS 5 years before it was close to BMW. I hope for GN sake they do get it right. "
"flightnurse","May 2012"," walk away from that 335.. "
"flightnurse","May 2012"," One could say, the ATS should be priced lower then the CTS, so a base price could be speculated. A base CTS is $36K a base 328i starts at $35K, so one could say the ATS should start at about 30K or even less. GM at times seems not get the pricing game correct, if they want to sell the ATS then they need to get very aggressive on the price, mid level ATS should be priced at about $33K make it less then a BMW enough for people to think twice about spending more money on a car then they need to. "
"graphicguy","May 2012"," dino....granted, I've only driven a 3 with the SMG trans once, and it was only on a brief test drive. But, I came to the conclusion BMW's SMG trans isn't nearly ready for prime time. Maybe it's something you get used to. But, the one I drove was in a new 335is. It wasn't remotely smooth, nor was it particularly sporty.Again, could have been I wasn't used to it. But, I knew it wasn't for me within a minute or two of driving it.flightnurse.....I've heard rumblings on some of the other BMW specific forums when the PP first was announced that the 335is folks got the short end of the stick, considering what they paid to get the ""is"" version.

"flightnurse","May 2012"," Graphic I drove a M3 with the SMG and didn't like it, this was the last generation M3 ( I beleive) and I hoped they have gotten it right, but I guess not. Too bad, since Porsche,Audi and VW sure has. I would consider a new BMW with a SMG if it worked as well as VW's... "
"nyccarguy","May 2012"," I know a guy who has been a DIE HARD stick driver his entire life. He had a 997 911 C2 (6 speed manual). He got rear ended at a light and the car was very badly damaged (he was in the hospital for 2 months). The car wasnt damaged enough to be totalled, but he said it never drove right after he got it back. He immediately began searching for a new car. His 1st stop was a BMW dealership. He nearly walked out when the salesman said they didn't have any 6 Speed Stick M3s in stock for him to drive. The guy practically begged him to drive the DCT equipped M3. He drove it and absolutely LOVED it. He ended up buying an M3 Convertible with DCT. "

"flightnurse","May 2012"," Well when I bought my 2000 vette there were not rebates on it, of course they do sell everyone they make. The size of the car is important, since the ATS is smaller then a CTS, not too sure how they is going to play out... The 2012 3 series is a bigger car then 2011, the A4 is about the same size as the 3, and the C class now has livable back seats. This is going to be interesting. "
"sweendogy","May 2012"," A similar article was on edmunds earlier in the week- I don't think it's the starting price but the options prices and standard features that need to define if it's a player -I think we need further details before totally dismissing a non-BMW.

"graphicguy","May 2012"," flight....nyc....just goes to show, an opinion is worth what I charge for it  .I didn't like the SMG in the BMW. Others may like it quite a lot.Over the last several years, I've strayed away from manual transmissions. I think the automatics have become so accomplished and efficient, I don't think I can match the performance of a good automatic. The 6-speed auto in my 3 is great. I know I couldn't match the shifts if I were driving it with a manual.....and I'm pretty good with the left pedal.Some cars just cry out for a manual....like muscle cars.....or a Porsche. Everything else, a good automatic will net more performance 9 out of 10 times.Someone mentioned 3 series diesel cars a while back in here. I was in Manchester U.K. for business a few weeks ago. My company has a couple of cars for those of us visiting to use. I think they lease them as they change every 3-4 years. They put me in a diesel Jaguar. Not a bad car, at all. They don't understand our (meaning U.S.) affinity for ""petro"" cars. But, gas is about $9-$10/gal there. So, diesels are very popular. "
"flightnurse","May 2012"," Graphic when it comes to the argument for and against a manual transmission I would place BMW and Vette in the category as must have. Growing up I have had only three cars that didn't have manual transmission. 65 Mustang, 57 Continental Mark II and a 1970 Datsun truck that had a Buick V6 in it. However, after driving the VW DSG car, I could live with a good dual clutch transmission car, but BMW has not built one yet. I do see the future going in that direction when it comes to performance cars.When it comes to prices in the UK and the EU the price for Petrol and Fuel (diesel) are about the same, this is why Diesel's are so popular. BTW, it was me who talked about the 335d. "
"robbieg","May 2012"," I think that regardless of the actual transaction price the ATS has to be priced less than BMW if for no other reason than frequently people look online to check out a car. I would think that if they are priced too close together no one would even take a hard look at the ATS at which point they might discover the discounts. Sometimes the ""discount"" doesn't appear quickly and it turns people off. Or in some markets, you have dealers that don't discount as heavily as dealers in other markets. "

"markcincinnati","May 2012"," I have now reached 15,000 miles on my 2012 Acura TL Advance SH-AWD. I have had two oil changes and at the second change the SH-AWD ""fluid"" was changed (very expensive.) The tires have been rotated twice.I keep the tires cold inflated to: front 37, rear 35. I decided to stick with the somewhat crappy OEM tires that came with the car, since they are all-season UHP's and I wanted to go through winter (very light even for Cincinnati) with the OEM's kind of to allow me to ""testify"" about the OEM selection.I added 4 splash guards and the backup sensors -- otherwise the thing is bone stock.I bring my own oil -- Mobil 1 -- for the changes, and all service has been performed by the dealer, Lindsay Acura, Columbus, OH.This is one boring car from a service perspective. It did, however, seem peppier after the second oil and ""fluid"" change -- in that respect it reminded me somewhat of my experience with Audi's -- they feel more powerful at 5,000 and again at 10,000 miles.I am not used to paying for service (Audi and BMW spoiled me in that regard) -- so $230 oil changes including tire rotations are painful. But in fairness, the reason for the expense on the last one was the SH-AWD fluid, which won't be changed again for a long time.This car seems almost freakishly unfazed by miles and time. There are NO rattles, no wear and tear (inside or out) tells that could give away the car's age (in miles.) Most of my German cars -- my 2005 Audi A6 3.2 quattro being the ONLY exception -- have always started to either feel or (upon examination) show their age by this point.The last two BMW's developed rattles in a similar time / miles situation. The Audi seemed to be a dirt magnet -- and I wash my cars twice weekly (including vacuuming the interiors), so it is not due to some change in my auto-hygene regimen that I tell you the Acura at 15,000 miles feels totally new, looks new, drives new, etc etc. The only difference is it gets somewhat better mileage now and it has a bit more pep in its step.Yet the TL remains a compromise car -- it is ""in the ballpark"" with the Germans I have been used to (and by in the ballpark, I mean broadly: features, content, power, price, etc.) but it is about 9/10ths. Now considering it's VALUE quotient, perhaps it is more than 9/10ths; but, when I push it hard through a curvy back road it makes me think, ""this is soooo close, but just not quite there."" Of course my lease payments are $100 per month less than the outgoing 2009 A4 2.0T quattro sport and the Acura still feels the same as it did (as noted above) the day I got it. The Audi, on the other hand, at 15,000 miles had already gone through a set of tires (and very expensive ones at that) and just seemed a bit more worn.I have come to a conclusion, perhaps incorrectly so, that like the hyper expensive tires that came with the A4 and pooped out young (they turned to powder in an effort to make the car feel as if it were on rails), perhaps the German cars perform better for a shorter period of time. The Japanese -- perhaps -- don't perform as well from the get go, but they ""take a lickin' and keep on tickin'"" with minimal fuss and care.The sales manager of the Acura store came from an Audi store and he remarked that the Germans make the best performing cars, period, but that they require the owner to take much more of an active role in maintaining that ultra high performance standard.I have a Sheltie -- very low strung, very low maintenance (groomed about every 8 weeks and that's it) -- perhaps the Sheltie analogous to a Japanese ELLPS or LPS car. Now, then, there are some other breeds which seem to be high maintenance, but win a lot more ""best in show"" awards -- perhaps the German cars are like a high strung high maintenance dog breed.Beats me -- the Acura certainly has been superior at one thing, though: not aging. :surprise: "

"nyccarguy","May 2012"," 15,000 miles is LITERALLY nothing for a Honda Product (nor should it be for ANY CAR at this price point). My 10 year old (146,200 mile) Prelude is extremely well screwed together. I'm still on the original shocks.Thanks for the 15K report. I'm glad you are enjoying the car (the 9/10ths of it anyway;) & the $100 per month in your pocket.You are bringing your own oil & still getting a $231 bill for an oil change? Your dealer seems to charge an awful lot of money. "
"sweendogy","May 2012"," I've had a car for 30k and I dont think I've spent 231 bux total on oil changes and I use oil the dealer puts in. "
"markcincinnati","May 2012"," I bought the car using carwoo.com -- the Columbus dealer gave me a 13% off sticker price.I drive to Columbus twice weekly, and I am always in Columbus on either Saturday or Sunday. The time between cities is 100 minutes.When the change oil reminder comes on, I call the dealer that I bought the car from and make a Saturday appt. I ask for the car I want as a loaner, an MDX or ZDX, etc and I get to test drive that car for the day whilst the car is being serviced.The $230 oil change was due almost entirely to the fact that at the second oil change the SH-AWD fluid has to be changed -- and it is very pricey.While 15,000 may be ""nuthin"" for a Honda (which is another reason the Acura is only 9/10ths), an Audi with 15,000 miles on it is middle aged. I have kept ONE German car more than 50,000 miles. The German cars drive great, perform great, look great and their features and functions are the standard by which the other guys measure themselves (or so I assume.)Yet ONLY this car feels new at 15k miles -- the German cars seem to begin the aging process by 15K miles.Now give me the choice of the Acura or the Audi and get rid of the price issues, well, at this point I would still go with the German despite my belief that it will age faster than the Japanese car. In fact I am starting to believe that an American car will also age more slowly due to the fact that we Americans think nothing of making two round trips to Columbus Ohio from Cincinnati per week, whereas a German would take a train for such a distance if at all possible (which it almost always is, in Germany and most of Europe.) Another example, I do business in Chicago -- 275 miles from Cincinnati. I used to fly. Now the 5 hour drive to Chicago is about identical to the time it takes to make the trip on Delta (all things considered.)And I can drive there in an Enterprise rental for a fraction of the cost of a plane ticket. These days I am probably putting 18-20K per year on my car because it is more prudent and pragmatic than the currently available alternatives.In any case all of these things seem to support driving cars that think 15K miles ain't no thang.

That doesn't change the fact that TL's can stand in their own spotlight.Keep us posted on your ongoing experiences.flightnurse....the diesels I've driven have varied from very nice (the Jag), to painful (an old Benz). Still, I'd have a hard time making a case for one in this country....unless, as is true in the U.K., diesel prices = gasoline prices.It seems the U.S. is going with plug-in hybrids or VOLT type vehicles rather than diesels.

"markcincinnati","May 2012"," I couldn't even begin to answer your question. Historically, Volvo's live very long lives -- and are expensive to maintain and repair like their German cousin's.Today, I would EXPECT, any car (virtually any) to make it to 150,000 miles with normal maintenance and a few repairs.Now then, the issue is what is the definition of normal maintenance?My wife's last BMW (a 2008) could only have an oil change (that was free) when the car said it needed it -- once this was at 19,000 miles. Since the car was leased, we changed the oil and did the other things when the book called for it. To me BMW's service recommendations aren't ""normal,"" since the miles between service intervals seems impossibly long.Audis want oil changes every 10K miles -- and there is no computer inside that is determining when the maintenance should really be performed. I would think that would make a used, late model, Audi perhaps less prone to the wear that a BMW might have with its very very long service intervals.I repeat, I have no clue how soon it will be -- in miles -- before you will notice your Volvo isn't ""new"" anymore. I turned in my 2009 A4 2.0 with just under 55,000 miles on it -- it needed new tires (what would have been its third set) and the sport suspension seemed to be a bit ""worn"" feeling. Also it used a quart of oil every 2,000 miles, which seemed excessive, although the dealer told me there was a TSB on it that essentially cured that issue.Of our 29 German cars, only my 60,000 miles young 2005 A6 3.2 still felt ""young-ish"" after 30,000 miles. The difference in the German cars is they drive like no other -- so what you get are cars that ""die young and leave a good looking [driving] corpse.""One more time, for the same money, I'd still take the German car even though I believe it will be breathtakingly expensive to keep young. :surprise: "
"flightnurse","May 2012"," Mark I like reading your post, however, I'm not getting this ""young feeling"" you talk about. My 05 330ci feels better today with 47K miles on it then it did when I picked it up in Germany in 05. When I slide into the 330 the feeling I is like visiting an old friend, everything feels right. I haven't gotten that with my 11 yet, since I have less then 4K miles on it. I do know that the German cars get better with age and miles. Now my 330 I have gone through 5 set of tires, and yes, I have taken it on a couple of track days, but it is the price of driving my BMW to 8/10 when I can. The biggest difference between the Japaneses and German cars is personality the Japaneses cars lack personality. They are great appliances.. "
"billyperksii","May 2012"," The guy owned 29, I think its fair enough to value his opiion. "
"flightnurse","May 2012"," NO one is arguing that, but for he most part, the German cars age better then others, that is all I'm saying.

"jwilliams2","May 2012"," The difference in the German cars is they drive like no other -- so what you get are cars that ""die young and leave a good looking [driving] corpse."" My experience is different....I've always gotten great service and longevity from German cars. Starting with a '55 VW that I bought some 50 years ago. I've also had an Audi, some BMWs, and several Mercedes. I always keep my cars a long time, generally 10-15 years and always go over 100k. My '86 MB 300E went 245k, and I sold it maybe 10 years ago to someone who still drives it. My current MB is 15 years old, and has 136k on it. It is absolutely the best car I've owned, and looks as good and is as tight today as it was when new. None of my cars had major problems or cost more than what I consider reasonable to maintain.Just something about driving these cars that makes them stand out.

"dino001","May 2012"," Well, blowing somebody at lights is not my concern, but if wanted to my previous Subarus would do just fine. I also would rather take a car without personality than with a bad one. The aging argument on German cars depends on what we are talking about. The chassis, main mechanicals, as long as maintained and not abused are probably fine for long. However, I would not be so sure about electrical system, motors, switches, etc. I think at some point Germans could not resist replacing $20/50000 hrs with one for $5/8000 hrs (just example, not real numbers) on false calculation of short-term ownership by first owner and they are slowly working back that lapse of judgement. There is also their high maintenance-high complexity culture that has been present for decades (their war machines were like that, too, e.g. Panther tank required fully equipped shop to replace transmission and it had to be taken apart - allied/Russian tanks could have field tranny replacements; even its staggered wheel pattern made it more difficult to field replace the tracks on the field). Every design has it objectives and constraints. At some point, getting closer to objectives (more performance in a car, better performing armored battle vehicle) comes at price of maintenance, complexity, which in turn can adversely affect the primary objectives in long term. In simple words, while working the machine has no equal, but to make it work can be cost prohibitive and even small setback has a potential becoming a major problem. "
"dino001","May 2012"," As I mentioned, in engineering there is a point of diminishing returns, where gains in primary objectives are being offset by increasing costs, both direct and indirect and unintended effects.I would say the main difference between Japanese and German cars is Germans are willing to test that limit going beyond it and are able then sell the product to willing people, like me. Japanese are asking different question, basically at what point it is good enough and not affecting other paralled objectives. That may be defined as lacking soul, but I don't think that is fair. It is matter of different objectives. "

"graphicguy","May 2012"," Flight....in Europe, I can see the appeal of diesel cars. Here, where the vast majority of the time, diesel fuel is normally sold at a significant premium over gasoline, I can't see it catching on with passenger cars.That said, I keep meticulous records on my 3.

That's almost a 30% swing....with no supply disruption, with worldwide demand either flat, or declining. Tell me that traders aren't manipulating prices.Japan vs German.....well, I think my former TL was built as well as anything I ever owned from Germany (essentially, 3 BMWs). That said, the CTS coupe I test drove was as solid as anything I've ever driven.I had heard that the Audis were oil hogs, from more than one person. But, sounds like they may have a ""fix"" in the works for that.My 2nd choice over my 335i coupe was either an S4 or an A5. At least locally, none of the ones they had in stock appealed to me.

Sure it's only been driven by me, is in great shape but those tiny little gremlins in the dash could strike any day.2) stick shift, save the manuals - I for one think the modern manuals are better then automatics,why? Well they make you become more engaged with the car and more aware of the other drivers- you are constantly monitoring speed- making sure you are in the right gear to pass- or to slow. I think it's a better way to drive period. I know 95% drive autos- but to me they are not driving - they are being driven. You can talk about dct, automanual, cvts- sorry they don't do it for me.

"markcincinnati","May 2012"," There are plenty of resources -- both subjective and objective -- that discuss the German cars personalities or that decry the Japanese for making appliances.All the ""did too"" ""did not"" that we may throw out here can also be additional data points -- there are so many of us we're not just relying on anecdotes, that is.Virtually all cars have improved in reliability and durability -- but for whatever reason the Japanese cars (regardless of where they really come from) certainly seem to win the durability sweepstakes while the German cars typically win the fun to drive contest but pretty regularly are written about as being less durable.My rattle free TL or my wife's rattle prone BMW certainly can't be assumed to represent all Acuras or BMWs and certainly shouldn't be assumed to represent ANYTHING other than themselves.The surveys that are availble, however, regularly and frequently conclude that a Japanese car family (fill in the blank) will often far outlive a ""similar"" German car family (also fill in the blank) insofar as durability is concerned. And of course there is the matter of the expense of keeping any car beyond a certain point.One of the folks I work with has a 13 year old Lexus and a 10 year old BMW -- both with well over 100K miles on the odometer. Both cars are paid for -- yet the BMW is often being driven in so that it could get the latest $1,100 repair or replacement part -- NEVER has the Lexus required such an outlay, according to my buddy.On the other hand, another co-worker's BMW required new rotors and pads at 50,100 miles and his service cost almost the day out of warranty was over $1,800.Now I wouldn't say the BMW was non durable due to the service costs the day the warranty died -- it just seems odd that would happen so young.

Well worth the $48/ year the membership costs. You also get a fantastic magazine, ROUNDEL every month. "
"nyccarguy","May 2012"," My wife got a flat on Thursday in her Pilot. I dropped the Pilot off at the tire shop Thursday night, which means she gets my 328xi for the day on Friday, & I've got to drive the Prelude to work (cue the violins, we should all have such problems). Jumping back into the BMW this AM, I immediately noticed how much it weighs compared to my (3042 lb) Prelude.Dynamically, like I've said my 3 blows my former TSX out of the water. My TSX's stereo gets major points as compared to the base stereo in my 328xi. "

"rayainsw","May 2012"," I have been out of [ internet ] touch for a week and a half, or so. In scanning through recent posts, I have seen reference to the BMW 335iS [ I am at 8,000+ miles on a lease - a 2011 Coupe with DCT ] and references to the SMG trans.I drove an M3 w/SMG trans. Once. Several years ago. Not smooth, I agree. The DCT, I find to be incredibly smooth under almost every driving circumstance, amazingly quick in up & down shifting &#150; and for me, it works extremely well with the TQ of the &#145;overboosted&#146; N54.I chose the 335iS for several reasons. And I am quite happy with my choice. Compared with the BMW Performance Power Kit for the N54 engines, the 335iS overboost provides 370 TQ, for long enough to get into a heap of trouble. The PPK offers 317 TQ w/DCT. [ Below quote from BMW. ] The DCT was not available in the &#145;regular&#146; 335i. The stock performance exhaust on the &#145;iS&#146; is a nearly perfect compromise [ for me ] between interesting and obnoxious volume &#150; and I find the sound at WOT to be absolutely intoxicating. Oh, and I really liked the style of the 18&#148; wheels on the &#145;iS&#146;. [ Style 313 ]- RayFWIW'Torque is increased to 332 lb-ft (when equipped with an automatic transmission) and 317 lb-ft (when equipped with a manual or DCT transmission).' "
"nyccarguy","May 2012"," I'll have a chance to sample it later this summer or early fall. A friend of mine has a new M5 on order (with the DCT) & I've already been promised a test drive;) "
"rwoller","May 2012"," I love my active cruise control on my 2006 series 3. I was thinking about buying a new E30 version, but there is no active cruise. Does anyone know what happened to it? Is it available in Europe? Is it in the cards for the future.If this is in the wrong section, I'm sorry. I couldn't find how to create a new section.Raymond "
"sweendogy","May 2012"," Ray right section- nothing but BMW experts here, ex me- answer being researched right now by one of them - would also point out Infiniti has this as part of a tech pack - plus there are 3k deals off cars right now from the manufacture - "
"flightnurse","May 2012"," Raymond the active Cruise was offered on the E30, it will be offered on the F30 not until July. . "
"flightnurse","May 2012"," Excellent, I hope that BMW got the DCT right this time!!! Of course it was called SMG in the past... "
"andys120","May 2012"," My understanding is that the DCT is a true twin-clutch set-up whereas the SMG was a kind of bastardized auto-clutch hybrid of an automatic shift and a manual.There was no adaptive cruise con on the E30 (1982-93), perhaps you mean the F10 (current 5 Series). "
"sweendogy","May 2012"," Smg, dct, rmv - all take a backseat to a short throw manual. If you are buying an m3 or a 335 or a 335s or a s4/5 or a Gti for that matter and don't spin your own gears - why bother. Here come the arguments about how far they've come- better mpgs, faster to 60- sorry. If the car has a sweet manual available - its tHe only way to go. "
"nyccarguy","May 2012"," I'll be the 1st (of many here on the board) to agree with you that there's nothing like ripping through the gears of a slick shifting manual transmission with the engine screaming towards its 7400 RPM redline (like in my Prelude).The traditional automatics have gotten better than the old 4 speed slushboxes of the 80's & 90's. They are just as fast & get better fuel economy. The double clutch auto manuals (dsg, DCT, pdk) will shift faster than any human can around a race track.My biggest reason for buying my BMW in an automatic (besides the fact it was a leftover) is because it is easier. Easier when my wife has to take my car 1 - 2 x per week. Easier when I'm literally crawling in traffic on a Thurs or Friday afternoon on The Cross Bronx, The Merritt, or Conn Turnpike (I 95). "
"dino001","May 2012"," I take another position - as long as any car that I may want can be had with manual, I will take nothing else. Once it is not, I may look around. I don't care about ""deals"", waiting 3 months on the order, or what not. Going to Germany is only an icing on the cake for me, even if after flying back I had to wait almost two months to get it back (well, I chose to pick it up in the Performance Center, so they had to get me another time slot there, which probably extended the wait time by anothe couple of weeks).I understand I may need to pay more (dealer may be less inclined to discount a car that's not on his lot), especially if I also want unpopular body type (like that wagon - you won't believe how many people look at that and say ""I didn't even know they make them...""), or feature combination. I simply don't care - to me saving two or three grand on car that I don't really want, is not real saving. If I'm about to drop 45 grand (give or take), it has to have everything I want and nothing I don't, be in right color, etc. Couple of thousands less would make me feel better for just about a week - then I start picking it apart in my mind, which will inevitably lead to premature trade. It pretty much happened with STI - except it was planned. The car was a great deal (30 grand plus taxes on $36.5K sticker PLUS 0% interest), but because it was a compromise (in my mind anyway), I knew the moment I bought it that it was a transitional car (transition to my current 328). It was OK so no torture driving it, but there were some aspects I didn't care for. Financially it turned out to be a deal of a century: I sold it three years later for $22.8K three years later, which turns into less than 300/month depreciation, including full tax (I did not trade the car in). I know I won't get such depreciation on my wagon, but I simply could not wait to get it. In contrast to the STI, with my current 328, I can see trading it early (less than 5 years) only because it turned to be a money pit (some early failures raising red flags), or new offerings get me excited over the top (e.g. they come with 3-series GT in 335i variety with manual tranny) and I have some new money lying around I don't know about. BTW, I'm not so easy to excite when it comes to spending money.They just showed pictures new 3-series touring (wagon). Very nice outside - maybe even better looking. But I'd rather stay with my six-in-line. I love that engine, every day, every minute. Doesn't matter it is not superfast, it just feels right. They can keep that four-cyl turbo for now.  "
"qbrozen","May 2012","  If you are buying an m3 or a 335 or a 335s or a s4/5 or a Gti for that matter and don't spin your own gears - why bother. I don't understand the question. Why bother with what? Driving a car? :confuse: "
"graphicguy","May 2012"," Fastest car I've ever driven was a Lingenfelter Corvette Z06. It had an automatic and would embarrass just about anything else on the road. And no, it wasn't mine. The trans snapped off shifts faster than any human could do. Acceleration was brutal and instantaneous, no matter where the throttle was, or what speed I was going (backed off at 137 MPH). "
"sweendogy","May 2012"," Why bother getting a performance car- stick to Lexus Es "
"qbrozen","May 2012"," That's just silly. So, in essence, you are stating that all performance cars have or should have manual transmissions. I'm sure Ferrari, Lambo, and F1 teams, among others, would disagree with you.As you stated, the new transmissions are faster than manuals... so they are more performance oriented. I could argue, why buy a performance car if you are only going to hinder it with a slower manual?Of course, I WON'T say that because I am a true enthusiast who appreciates capable cars in all configurations. "
"kyfdx","May 2012"," That straight-line acceleration just isn't that important to me... I mean, all things being equal, I'll take more power... but, that isn't a major part of my choice..My wife's Infiniti G37X will blow my doors off in a straight line.. 327 HP.. It is stupid fast... But, it is a bloated truck compared to my car... I wouldn't trade even up, if I had to drive it every day (and, it's worth twice the value of mine). "
"flightnurse","May 2012"," I wonder how much longer Manuals will be offered, With the way technology has advanced in the last 10 yrs, the DSG's of today that offer 6,7 and 8 speeds and that can fire off shifts faster then Sweeny can start a flame war. One thing I like about the VW DSG was, you could select any gear you want, but ifthe RPMs were too high, the transmission wouldn't shift to that gear until the rev's were in the correct shift point, a nice feature when coming into a corner and you want both hands on the wheel and motoring out of the corner without problems.For me, if the BMW DCT is as good as what people are saying, I wouldn't mind taking a loot at it on my next BMW (if it is offered.)But of course, it is a personnel preference I use to breath manual transmission's only, but as I'm getting older, I like today's DSG and DCT transmissions. "
"sweendogy","May 2012"," Silly - like bringing labo and Ferrari into this conversation? Just because they are faster, does not mean they are performance oriented. This idea that autos are better is one of choice, sometimes laziness. 95% of new cars here in th states are autos - does that make them better? The tsx is a perfect example of a car that equipped with a manual becomes a totally different car then the accord underpins would suggest.True enthusiasts choose manuals ( more often). Let me know when you get the Lamborghini and I will try out the dct. "
"graphicguy","May 2012"," kyfdx....I understand what you're saying, but that 'vette was something that I had never experienced before. Now, if I were looking for something to go drive through the Appalachians, that wouldn't have been my first choice. But, if I had to choose a car to get from Cincinnati to Chicago as quick as I could? That would have been my very first choice.Like you, for my daily driver, I want a fast car, that handles and rides well, regardless of road. That's why I buy what I buy. I'm sure same goes for you.GF, on the other hand, loves driving my Fiesta (which is a nice little handling car in it's own right) and her Avalanche. She just acquired a nice little Subaru Outback, too. "
"qbrozen","May 2012"," Just because they are faster, does not mean they are performance oriented.Yeah... you're right. What was I thinking saying Ferrari and Lambo are performance oriented. :lemon:The tsx is a perfect example of a car that equipped with a manual becomes a totally different car then the accord underpins would suggest.I agree. And that's because the slushbox attached to it sucks.This idea that autos are better is one of choice, sometimes laziness. 95% of new cars here in th states are autos - does that make them better? I never once said it was better. Let me know when you get the Lamborghini and I will try out the dct. Go down to the store and try one out for yourself. Probably easier to try the PDK out at the Porsche store, though. Make sure you get one with the Sport Chrono pack. "
"qbrozen","May 2012","  I use to breathe manual transmission's only, but as I'm getting older, I like today's DSG and DCT transmissionsI'm with you. Although I don't want to say its due to age. Partly, I blame my non-manual-driving wife. But I do also like the performance advantage. It is the same reason I chose the 1 over the 3 ... to lose the weight. The 3 would have been way more comfortable and sensible, but I wanted all the bang for my buck I could get out of that N54 engine. "
"dino001","May 2012"," I actually have no problem with autos or auto-like transmissions on those 400hp+ supersport cars. That makes sense, as true manual may burn through clutch in alarming rate and and it may be just too hard to drive even for more skilled drivers. It starts making sense to replace human foot with computer-actuated shaft to simply make use of all those horses. If it's good enough for Sebastian Vettel, it probably would be good enough for me  - if I could ever afford it, which I won't. However, if we are talking entry-level performance cars with 250-350 hp, especially on lower end of that range, I think I'd not get an auto, if manual were available - and I would look for manual availability in original selection process, i.e. Lexus IS350, MB C350 are out, Infiniti G37, BMW 335 are in (and so on) unless there is something really special about those former ones (which my understending is, there isn't). "
"Kirstie_H","May 2012"," I laugh in the face of any accusation that failing to choose manual transmission is due to laziness, as it's usually made by those who use dishwashers, clothes washers, don't change their own oil, etc. - all decisions that are generally made on the basis of effort:benefit ratio, commonly known as ""efficiency."" "
"sweendogy","May 2012"," The older arguement is very valid, part of the reason why autos will eventually be the only option as older people not teaching youth how to drive stick, sad day. I'm not that old, flightnurse knows my age, this is not a good trend as manual transmissions engage the driver - cell phones, nav systems alot easier to use with the right hand free to play. If you think your a better driver because your car shift itself to 60 quicker then a manual would, you are wrong. "
"m6user","May 2012"," If you think your a better driver because your car shift itself to 60 quicker then a manual would, you are wrong.And if you think you are a better driver just because you drive a stick...you are also wrong.Being a good driver has nothing to do with driving a stick or not. I know people that drive sticks and they still manage to do all sorts of other things with their hands which probably makes them even more dangerous on the road. I also know drivers that drive automatics that keep both hands on the road and don't ""ecommute"" so to speak so that may make them better drivers. We really don't know who is the better driver based on the type of transmission they use. There's a lot of yahoos out there driving sticks that may think they are good drivers but are really just accidents waiting to happen. Of course, that goes for those that drive autos too.  "
"qbrozen","May 2012","  If you think your a better driver because your car shift itself to 60 quicker then a manual would, you are wrong. Ummm... I don't. I also don't think I'm a muskrat ... which has about as much relation to what I've said so far as the statement you just made. :confuse:BTW, in case you don't realize, and just to point out, I have 3 cars currently, and only 1 is an auto. The other 2 are sticks because that was the better performing option on those particular vehicles.The older arguement is very validOf course it is. I never said otherwise. Do you read my posts at all? Or are we speaking different languages and I'm just not aware of it? "
"graphicguy","May 2012"," m6user.....you and Kirstie make valid points.A humorous story, my best friend ordered and took delivery of a brand spanking new, manual transmission Corvette convertible a couple of years ago. He drove it straight from the dealership to my house to show it to me.He had the top down, stereo cranked (I could hear it from the 2nd floor of my house). I went outside to see him sitting in the driver's seat beckoning for me to ""hop in"". I did just that. He gave the throttle a couple of blips, then let out the clutch. You know where this is going. He stalled it dead. I told him he better let me drive..... :P Another....this happened to me last Fall. Why people think they need to race BMWs is beyond me. But, some do.Stopped at a red light on a 4 lane. Guy pulls up next to me in a 350z.....arrest me red. He blips the throttle a couple of times, letting me know he was gonna, by golly race me stop light to stop light.Light turns green. I pull away....no Z. I look in the rearview.....he stalled it.Last one.....this is when I had my TL SH AWD. I was driving the backroads near Amish country. There are great driver's roads there (must be careful of horse drawn carriages).This time it was a G that wanted to prove their prowess. Long and short if this, he and I went back and forth, one in front of the other at different times. Until, Mr G must have hit 4th instead of 2nd, bogged down and stalled. He became a picture in my rear view.Everybody has those stories, however. "
"nyccarguy","May 2012"," You make some excellent point (as you always do) about not compromising for whatever amount of money you choose to spend on whatever car. You buy your car for you and only you. That's the way to do it!I would have been more selective of colors/options/transmission choices, ect if I didn't have my Prelude. I also truly would not have been able to afford such a nice BMW had it not been for the insane incentives. Right now I've got the best of both worlds. I get my stick fix in when I WANT (Sat work commuter) & a more than capable (powered by a truly amazing Inline 6) AWESOME commuter car for that I won't own out of the warranty period for every other day of the year. I'm not entirely sure what's going to happen when my lease is up. Kyfdx convinced me NOT to buy the car out after the lease is up (He's a very bright, sensible guy & is a host afterall:) I don't think I'm going to like the new Turbo 4 & Electric Power Steering (part of what I HATED about my TSX) on the F30 3er. It is going to be a more expensive car to buy (higher MSRP when similarly equipped), I won't be able to buy it (or lease it) for the same amount unless I severly cut down some of the options, which would be a huge compromise I'm NOT willing to make.I could lease something much cheaper (for commuting purposes) and put extra money to paying off my Pilot before it's finance contract's maturity date 4 years from tomorrow (it is a year old today). I've also got a mortgage & 3 kids to raise (and send through college). I've got my no compromises Prelude.I love the idea of doing ED, but it just doesn't work for me. I work 6 days a week & have 3 kids. My only vacation is the last 2 weeks of July every summer. "
"sweendogy","May 2012"," No need for the overbearing tone. Stick shift you drive the car- auto the car drives you. "
"dino001","May 2012"," There may be reasons not buy your car up at the end of the lease, but I'm not sure, if I would rule that out outright just yet. If the car gives you no trouble over next three years, you like it a lot (so far you do) and what's out there isn't so great, the buyout price should not bother you. Here is why: You should look at it from overall six (or so) year cost perspective, not just price at the buyout. You say you got some insane deal, which suggests you got both a good purchase price at the lease beginning, low money factor, and high residual. So you would be giving back some of that inflated residual - in a sense you'd defer the initial purchase (which was at low price, I remind you and finance charges were not very high up to this point). So say, you leased for three years and you have to buy reminder of 50-55% of MSRP (is that the residual?). Granted, it's a lot vs. real value, which may be more in 45%- area - but is it really? If you define your residual vs. trade-in value, it may be even less, but you have the advantage - you know the car. Moreover, you'd never be able to buy same car on the market for that much, dealers would mark them up and other owners would also want more than the dealers are offering. Moreover, you haven't paid much up to this point and you had a good initial discount. To get the total nominal cost (does not include other aspects of the ownership), add all the lease payments and initial downpayments, taxes and such, buyout purchase price and say 3.5%-4% loan for 36 months (can you do 24 months? - would be better...). If the total is still within reason vs. original car price and you like the car (and it has no problems so far), AND there is still nothing else around you'd equally like, why not do it? The alternative is you some hum-drum commuter on a lease that you'll dread every day you sit in it and every day you'll be thinking ""why, oh why I didn't take the bimmer""? "
"dino001","May 2012"," You buy your car for you and only you. That's the way to do it! Exactly right - I remember I had several discussions with people, to whom I had to explain that concept. They all cited low depreciation as a main reason of them getting some car, to which I would always say - I buy a car for me, not the next guy. Of course, it has its limits, e.g. if I had two otherwise equal (or at least very close) choices then I would look into depreciation. Also, if some vehicle has abnormally high depreciation, it is a good indication of possible troubles with quality - not always, but quite reasonably inferred. However, I never really had a problem with high depreciation cars so far - those did not appeal to me, anyway. It just happens that my latest choices, i.e. Subaru, BMW have been close to top of the charts in their respective classes, but I did not chose those brands for that reason. When I buy it, I assume it will be ""forever"", even if it is not realistic. So far it served me well. Will see, if the streak continues... "
"graphicguy","May 2012"," dinoo.....I know test driving an IS250 right after test driving an IS350 was such a big let down, there's no way I would have been happy with the 250. Same went for driving a ""non"" SH AWD tech TL vs a standard TL. I knew I wouldn't have been happy with the standard TL.I'm also in agreement that if you're spending 10s of thousands of dollars for a new car, get what you want. Don't settle for a color you may not want, or for cloth if you want leather.I know I probably spent the better of two months looking for my 335i. There were plenty around. But, they were either the wrong external color, or the wrong internal color, or the wrong options, etc. I wanted what I wanted. It took two dealers, two months to find the only one in the country I wanted. Both had to get it from the delivery dock and route it to their dealership. Only one was able to do that. They got my business. "

"sweendogy","May 2012"," So your saying the new fringed transmissions - when in auto mode tell you when to shift? Beginning this agreement (do you read all my posts?) I agree there are advantages to driving an auto- but in auto mode the driver is not as engaged as one would be in manual transmission- Pretty simple agreement. My belief is and will be if you choose a performance car (non Lamborghini) for your sporty car - it should come with a manual- if you drive 40 miles on the Merritt during rush hour I can't argue the benefits of an auto, but then again you are prob looking at not just a performance car for this task.Overbearing - for sure - btw the new es is here - new auto transmission you should check it out.Save the manualshttp://www.caranddriver.com/features/save-the-manuals-official-headquarters "
"flightnurse","May 2012"," Sweeny so a Porsche 911 Turbo with the PDK 8 spd is not a performance orientated car? Or a Boxster S ? BTW, when this discussion was started I don't remember you saying it had to a ELLP, you made a blanketed statement and people are proving that manual do not make the car. If this was the case then one could say that a VW Golf with a 6 spd manual is performance orientated car. NOT "
"flightnurse","May 2012"," Dino this is a personnel choice, there is no right or wrong choice here, this is the problem some people have. I would love to see how a G35 manual and a VW GTi with a DSG would pan out on the race track... Would be an interesting match up. "

"flightnurse","May 2012"," Sweeny your argument has some weak spots, First it is ok to have a auto is you have a 40 mile commute on the Merrit,so why not have the best of both worlds, the DSG/DCT give the commuter the auto they need when commuting to work and the Manual when they play on the track.Sweeny when was the last time you took your G on the track? So have you drive it like 99% of people in america, to and from work and to run errands? Are you the type that will play ricky racer from stop light to stop light? "
"sweendogy","May 2012"," Part 2 of the Flight Zone: you read my original post yet? Fully this time- Who's talking about the track? I never mentioned tracking at all - stay on point. I do understand people getting autos for the simple reason of being in traffic for a large portion of a cars use. Comment above about f1, while they do use a semi-auto gears - key term is semi....... (wiki) automatic gearboxes, and systems such as launch control and traction control, are illegal, to keep driver skill important in controlling the car- they want to keeep the driver engaged at all times, basically my original point from the post I linked to you.Staying in the flight zone--To answer your questions- have I tracked my g- no. Do I drive it to work and run Errands, no I have my butler Jeeves run my errands - and since my iPO going public tommorrow I will not work again. Do I blast from stop light to stop light, only when I see 45k BMW 328s (with autos) sitting across from me. Sometimes I race these 328s for pink slips, I have a few for sale sitting in my garage.I've done various schools- from skip barber to Team oneil - 8 different times on all types of tracks, on pavement, dirt and snow- not one of the cars I drove - from m3 to subi to mazda 3 to corvette was an auto or dct or whatever the auto lovers call the computer that changes gears.

"markcincinnati","May 2012"," You have made one probable misstatement in your post -- typically a car that is ordered and awaited for months CAN be discounted more than one that is already on the lot due to the costs associated with what are called holding costs.Cars that are ordered should be cheaper and will be EXACTLY what you want. I find it amazing, confusing and, frankly, disappointing that dealers stock ANY cars other than what can be used for test drives.On the other hand, I realize the near suicide this suggests for American car dealers. I was literally unable to order a car, THE car, as I wanted it. The dealer gave me a 24 hour deal -- 87% of sticker on THE ONLY one that he had that was equipped as I wanted it, just not in the color combo I wanted.I have no idea how they did the deal, 13% is huge -- yes?I took the car, off the lot, with the worst interior color imagined by a human: black.And now I must apologize to those who think a black interior is a good thing -- despite the fact that it makes the car seem so much smaller inside, so drab and confining. Anyway, typically (especially for European cars) buying by ordering will get the best price. "
"flightnurse","May 2012"," Sweeny I fully understand that to make you feel better about yourself you have to make other feel worse about themselves.When this whole talk about Auto (DCT/DSG) vs stick there was no talk that the car had to a ELLP. When other talked about Lambo's and Ferrari's you dismissed them. Doesn't matter what forum we are in, when you make a blanketed statement that only true performance cars have a stick, this allowed people to bring in other cars to show you were wrong. "
"markcincinnati","May 2012"," I am amazed at seeing yet another series of posts lauding stick shifts, suggesting or even outright saying that if you were driving a stick shift that everything would be better., there is no Stick shifts are great fun, of that there is no doubt. I guess manual transmissions are also more economical and -- in some cases -- quicker.An argument can be made that you are a better driver if you drive a stick. Likewise it can be argued that you can be make your car perform better IF it has a stick-shift.But the reality is that most Americans have no interest in stick shifts, hence the difficulties in finding them, unless your order one.Stick shift cars are, practically, not technically speaking, DEAD. Even in Europe they are dying.An 8-speed automatic European car is pretty nice to drive -- as is a 7 speed Japanese car. Even some six speed autotrans are good these days.Ultimately, no one will offer a stick shift -- due to lack of interest from the market.No car maker -- like BMW -- will offer a car with ONLY a manual transmission (other than their top of the line which will remain automatic) due to customer acceptance.Live with it, I say.I ordered my last stick shift in 2003, knowing the direction would be more autos and few stick shifts as every day passes.Where we are today is not the worst place we could imagine -- and frankly I wish we all drove automatics -- OH wait, we're almost there already. "
"dino001","May 2012"," You are right and wrong at the same time. It is a matter of psychology. One one hand, it is true that car ordered should be cheaper as dealer will not bear storage costs. On the other hand, many dealers, especially those in smaller markets are seeing special orders as opportunities to play classic ""hard to get"" game - they see you as already committed, so why bother to be aggressive with pricing. This is especially true on Euro delivery on BMW - dealers around my place don't even want to hear about discounting those. Of course, a threat to get it in place hundreds of miles away may work, but you must be ready to make good on it. I saw that playing so many times that it is not even funny. There are also other factors, like monetary incentives to move current inventory, no holdback on some brands (IIRC BMW, Audi), allotments and general ""instant gratification"" culture. At least German brand dealers are used to people ordering, but in many other places you see those deer in headlights faces, when you mention special combination and order in places like Toyota or Honda dealership. But even there it may not go as smoothly - last year I made an order on 2011 and it did not go through, cause they already closed the allotments on production. Lucky I got one a few months later.So many people would really have a hard time to understand why I would wait three months for a car, I had to explain myseld. The instant purchase is quite unique to American market - in many other countries people exactly order and wait a few months and think nothing of it, but here the market is better equipped to handle guy taking the blue one from Bay 25 than one picking options from the catalogue. So, there is a difference between what should/could be and what really is in practice. "
"nyccarguy","May 2012"," Again dino001 you bring up some excellent points. ""Like it a lot"" is an understatement. I've proclaimed my love for my 328xi over and over. I got an excellent selling price (over $5400 off the $44K sticker), a low money factor (although not as low as the 0.9% APR for 60 months they were offering), and a high residual (64% for 15K per year plus 10,000 miles extra) of $26,406. I paid only a $795 bank fee, $350 for new CT plates, $72 1st months pmt, a $12.50 NY tire fee, & taxes on these fees. I made a $0 cap cost reduction & didn't pay a security deposit. At the end of my 2 1/2 year lease, my car will have 50,000 miles. Will the car last longer? Absolutely. I have no doubt that the Inline 6 motor and the E90 chassis each in their last year of a model run will be close to bulletproof. Yes I will know the car. I know there are literally thousands of similar 328xis that will flood the market in late summer/early fall 2014. Private owners always think their car is worth more than it is & dealers charge insane amounts for loaded up, low mileage, creampuffs. My parents each had 2 modern era BMWs (Dad - '04 X5 & '07 X5, Mom - '05 530i & '08 328xi) that both held up very well for between 10 & 30K past their respective warranties. Even my wife's former '07 X3 was only at the dealer for scheduled maintenance for the 3 years/ 45K we had it.If I wanted to buy the car out at a nice discount at the end of the lease, I would wantr to pay cash for it. I'm not so keen on the idea of taking out a loan on a used car with 50K miles that's going to need tires and a whole slew of maintenance (i might go for the extended maintenance pkg).Time will tell & we shall see.

"fedlawman","May 2012"," If you can bring your car someplace with room to play, a stick shift can add fun to driving. And although having an automatic transmission on a twisty mountain road might dilute some of the fun, I don't think it is fair to say that the MT is some kind of requirement for enjoying a sporty car.Because in this segment, there are many things that dilute the fun of driving, of which the auto transmission is only one.If one is serious about enthusiast driving, then one will not buy a car that is needlessly saddled with hundreds of pounds of sound-deadening material, power/luxury items, and computer-controlled safety systems.By removing a few hundred pounds of fat, car makers could equip cars with smaller and lighter engines, wheels, tires, and brakes and yet sacrifice no performance. What enthusiast would say no to that?And while I do love the thrill of shifting my own gears, heel-and-toe downshifting, etc., I also really miss threshold braking. What a challenge it was to approach a corner under full throttle, transition to braking riding that fine line just above lockup, then trail-braking to the apex before tracking out. Anyone can push a clutch - this took real skill to master.So really, if someone is going to claim the superiority of the MT, then they must also condemn those who have ABS equipped cars, heavy cars, large cars, luxury cars, etc. - really, any car that isn't purpose-built for sport is a compromise. If they don't do this, then they are simply drawing an arbitrary line in the sand. "
"flightnurse","May 2012"," Hey Fed, I wonder how often people really know what you were talking about, trail braking, heal and Toe, threshold braking etc... You are right it is one thing to push the clutch in and change gears, but it is another to be able to do this while the back end is sliding out and counter steer around a corner. "

"graphicguy","May 2012"," markcincinnati....I agree about buying ordered cars. BMW makes it attractive to take European delivery of an ordered car, for example. On the other hand, as you pointed out, some dealers act like ordering a car should ""net"" them extra $$$ for the effort. There's practically no effort involved, short of checking a few boxes on a computer screen and entering your contact information.One of the BMW dealers tried this when I was trying to get my car from the port. They acted like there was something special, difficult, and unusual about that. And, they felt they should charge me for that privilege. They either couldn't, or wouldn't, make the effort to get the car from the port. Yet, my selling dealer could...and not charge me for the effort. My selling dealer told me ""sure....we'll get it....no problem"". They didn't even want a deposit.I was going on vacation right after I spoke to them. They said they'd have it ready for me when I got back a week later. They did just that. It was waiting for me all shined up in the showroom the day I returned.I've bought new cars in configurations I didn't 100% desire in the past (usually a color I didn't care for...either in or out). I've bought them ""on the cheap"" figuring that would placate me. It never did. The undesirable parts of the car became more and more of an issue, that I usually got rid of them pretty quickly (not that I need much reason to buy a new car to begin with).But, I understand those who might do that. And, for good reason if the price is right. I just know me. I'll waste more money in the long run by doing that.Finally, it's totally ridiculous to think the only good sports cars (or any car for that matter) come with manual transmissions. Last post from me on that matter. Why bother with such silliness.  "
"rayainsw","May 2012"," I ordered my BMW via European Delivery.US MSRP was just over $57K.Agreed selling price was just over $50K.- RayOne data point... "
"dino001","May 2012"," Wow, your terms are better than I even imagined. I think 26K plus tax for 2.5yr/50K miles 328xi may be higher than one may want to pay, but again, it is not completely outrageous, especially in context of knowing the car and getting a huge discount you got when you bought it and while you're paying your lease. It is basically giving a portion of that discount back, but if you love the car.... However, I can also see why you'd want to move on. All I'm saying don't rule it out just yet - simply wait until the time comes... "
"dino001","May 2012"," I observed the same thing. ""Special order"" is read by some dealers as a code word ""I can take you for everything you got and you should thank me for my kindness"". I would not be surprised if there were regional differences in that attitude. Here in Tampa I only know two people who did that: I and my Russian buddy pal. The natives don't even get the concept of order (well, not all of them, of course, but you get the idea). And the marked adpapts to that. "
"flightnurse","May 2012"," Ray great price, it must have been a leader ad according to some people. "
"flightnurse","May 2012"," Graphic when I bought my 05, the dealer never played games with me when it came down to price. Going in, I knew the price I was willing to pay for the car, and at the time, a 330i coupe fully loaded with the ZPH package was selling for MSPR off the lot. However, I knew that there was a 3% saving off the top when doing the Euro Delivery, so I knew there was wiggle room with the price. I was able to get my 330 out the door for less then MSRP. I got the car I wanted, with almost the color combo (the ZPH cars only came in black or grey leather, I wanted Tan) but other then that it was what I wanted. The hardest part was waiting to drive it in Europe and then again waiting for it to arrive at the BMW dealer after coming back from Europe. "
"flightnurse","May 2012"," Dino is it the dealer in general or the sales person that makes the difference? The other issue is instead gratification, people do not want to wait 6-8 weeks for their special ordered car to arrive. When I ordered my 05, I would hear people say, ""Oh, I know someone who did that and when they got their car, it wasn't what they ordered."" That might happen, but didn't for me and countless others who have done it. This might be the reason why I'm not a fan of the Japanese ELLPs, since I wanted it my way, and since the Germans' and American auto manufactures allow me to it I'll continue to go that route. On a side note, I love Tampa, reminds me of my home town of San Diego, also I love Babalu's over in St Pete, their wings and Grouper Nuggets are worth the trip when I'm in Tampa. "
"dino001","May 2012"," I think it may be combination of dealer culture, regional market and the person as well. Also brand. For example, BMW claims that all their cars are dealer's orders, which basically means they give them allotments on model, but dealers have to order the configurations. I sometimes see really silly results of that, like 328i loaner with premium, sports, sunroof and NO fold-down seats. Actually, I heard it is quite common (3-series w/o fold-down seats) - I can only imagine faces of a new-to-BMW customers getting one from the lot and the discovering they can't fold it, but neighbor's 10-year old Chevy or Kia can.Moreover, BMW actually has some colors/interior available only as orders (you can see it online), which means dealers sometimes make up fake customers to get them (e.g. LeMans blue only available as special order with M-package on previous 3-series was one of those). So order is part of their culture. On the other side of the spectrum is Honda - no orders AT ALL - they make what they want and then stick it to the dealers to sell. They make them in batches (same cars coming off the line in series), which reportedly improves quality, but limist dealers. There were some stories of big time corruption in Honda of USA, where dealers were bribing regional managers to get popular models/trims. Other brands may have a ""mixed culture"", allowing some order flexibility. That definitely explains some stories of cars not fitting the orders - I would not be surprised if dealers were faking taking the order and then trying to fit whatever customer ordered to cars available in transit. "
"graphicguy","May 2012"," flight...I was tempted to do European Delivery on my current car. I was starting to believe I wouldn't get what I wanted without ordering it. And, it would have allowed me to take a little trip to Germany, at a reasonable cost, since I could have booked so far in advance.When a dealer I visited (not the one I bought from) said they'd found the car I was looking for in port waiting to be delivered (to whom, I didn't know). They said they could divert it while at port. I had already agreed verbally on all pricing on the deal. They originally agreed to go and find the car for me, and do a dealer trade.Well, since they had to get it while at port, something triggered that they wanted to charge me an additional $500 to have it sent to their dealership. All dealership cars come from the port. It doesn't cost them extra. I asked them to explain, but got the nebulous, gobble-de-[non-permissible content removed], BS explanation.Concurrently, my local dealer, who said they couldn't find the car I was looking for, stumbled upon this same car at the port, about 3 days later than the original dealership. I explained I had a quasi-deal in place already. I gave them the numbers, they agreed to them (without the additional $500 fee to get it from port).Told the dealer if they could indeed get it, I was off on vacation and would get back to them after I returned. A week later, after vacation, I'm standing at the dealership doing the final inspection. Why my local dealer could do what the other (further away) dealership couldn't do, is beyond me.I'm not so certain this type of behavior is the sole providence of luxury dealerships. But, it seems some, not all, do try to try all sorts of crazy ways to pad profit in their deals. "
"dino001","May 2012"," To some it may simply be a game. They see a guy, he knows what he wants, there is only one car out there to fit it, let's try ""because we can surchage"". "
"flightnurse","May 2012"," Dino, my partner and I were at Chandler BMW last weekend, they have a very large selection of both used and new 3 series. Of the used ones were 10 ex loaner cars, 2011, 6 were 335i, all had the M sport package, Premium package, Nav, iPod connector and they were all black with black leather. Not the best combo here in Phoenix. 4 328i with only the Value package, iPod connector. Some of the other used cars looked like off lease specials, low mileage low optioned cars, Premium package and Value Package. Some of new 328 (sedans) were fully loaded, sport,Premium, convenience packages and Nav, MSRP 48K. There was one 328i coupe, with M sport package, convenience package, nav, Xenon headlights, BMW App, and Auto for 49K. BTW, no new BMWs with a Manual per the salesmen.This is why I would order my next car, I didn't see the color combo that i like or the options. I'm still trying to talk my partner into a 740i with the M sport package, however, the dealer didn't have a 740i or 740il only a 750il's... "
"dino001","May 2012"," I got black leather and I like it (Florida does not get as hot as Phoenix, but we get our share). Granted, I park in garage and my workplace has covered parking, too. The coolest thing - I can program my fans (ventilation) when I'm away. Works like a charm, when going shopping. "
"qbrozen","May 2012"," Yes, that was your original post... which was the one I asked you to clarify. Your response in #13983 was, ""Why bother getting a performance car- stick to Lexus Es."" No qualifiers... just ""performance car."" Meaning performance cars should only come with a stick.Moving on to post 14005...So your saying the new fringed transmissions - when in auto mode tell you when to shift?No. When it auto mode, they do what they want to do. But put it in manual mode and you have all the control of a manual transmission without the 3rd pedal.but in auto mode the driver is not as engaged as one would be in manual transmissionWell, first, I can't totally help here, as I don't drive mine in auto mode. But when driving my wife's minivan or Benz, I don't feel I'm any less engaged, no. When I'm driving around town, I am just as aware of what gear I'm in with those automatics as my manuals. The only time I feel disengaged in a vehicle is cruising on the highway, which involves no shifting in any of my vehicles. "
"nyccarguy","May 2012"," Now I WOULD NOT buy the car directly from BMW when the lease is up. They DO NOT negotiate lease buy outs (they'd rather loose money on the car at an auction for some reason). If I were to buy the car at the end of the lease, I would buy it from a dealer. BMWFS won't sell ME the car for cheaper than the stated value, but they will sell it to a dealer at market price who will in turn sell it to me for a profit that's less than the stated residual value.So even if a dealer were willing to sell it to me as a skinny deal for say $2500-$3000 less than the $26,400 value (say $1000 - $1500 over their cost), I'm still going to buy the extended maintenance package (The car calls for brakes @ 50,100 miles, Rear Brakes in the high 50s, and an Inspection II @ 60K) + buy a new set of tires (I'm sure the continental RFTs will be shot by then). Not so much of a problem if I'm buying the car for cash, but again I need to finance my vehicle (whether it be by a new car lease or used car loan). Still cheaper than spending upwards of $50K for a new (4 cyl, electric power steering) 328xi. Paying off a 3 year loan for (about) $28K (Selling price + extended maintenance + 6.35% sales tax) would give me a monthly payment of close to $800/month ($777) for a used car with 50K that will have 100K by the time I'm done paying it off.The low mileage cream puff 328xis that people lease for 10,000 miles per year will have ridiculously high asking prices that are above my stated $26K+ residual value. So like I said, nothing is written in stone. But I might have to skip over BMW when the lease is up and lease a commuter sled as a means to an end. If I lease a cheap car for 3 years and can save $300/month & pay off our Pilot early. Then I can get something I really want (like another BMW). My problem is that I LOVE the way my 328xi drives. "
"dino001","May 2012"," 50,100? Really. You know it already? Aren't you just a few months in? Those brake numbers will change, you may need new pads sooner.Didn't you mention that you'll have 50K miles on it, or did I get confused? If so, I don't think it's fair to compare your car to those 10K/yr lease returns. BTW, also if you 50K miles at time of return, it will be your SECOND set of Continentals ready to be replaced  "
"nyccarguy","May 2012"," I know I will need pads sooner, but at 50,100 miles (happened to my Dad on his '04 X5 SP & my Mom's 328xi) right after the free maintenance period the car calls for front brake pads (second set).No you didn't get confused. In 2 1/2 years, at the end of my lease, my car will have 50,000 miles on it. I don't think it goes through tires THAT quickly. Don't forget, my Continentals on my xi (non sport pkg) are all seasons (That should last 50K miles). I'd guess the Tires on your (RWD SP equipped Wagon) are high performance summer tires that will last you (maybe) 30K miles.Anyway, hopefully you will ALL still be here posting so you can chime in. We've got a good group on this board. "
"dino001","May 2012"," Yes, I have summers. Yours are all-seasons, but are still marketed as ultra high performance. Check Tire Rack comments on those Contis. You'd be lucky to get 30K, 40K is you are careful. Of course, I can be wrong... "
"markcincinnati","May 2012"," I have so little history with cars other than Audis -- which were all acquired from the same dealership and mostly from the same sales rep -- that my data point may only apply to Audis and for all I know may only apply to my dealership.Virtually every Audi my wife and I have owned were ordered -- I say ""virtually"" because there probably are a couple of cars that we didn't order, but we did at least dealer trade for the exact one we wanted. All of my wife's BMWs have been ordered cars -- and what follows applies to her BMW's too.When ordering, I have mostly ordered the top pre-configured model and added selected options or a manual transmission -- and certainly I chose the exterior and interior EXACTLY as I wanted it. I have, until this last time -- hence my abandoning ship and going with Acura -- always felt that by waiting 3 - 6 months I got the best deal on the exact car I wanted. Most folks I know seem to show off their new cars and during the walk around will say, ""I go the one that I wanted, but it didn't have nav or the upgraded sound system or the heated seats that I wanted."" HUH? Then they didn't get the one that they wanted, they compromised.Yet these same people will build half-million to one-million dollar houses and labor over the smallest details, or have the fireplace moved to the other side of the house (at considerable expense) because they want to sit and watch the sun rise, not set (or whatever.) Yet they'll buy $40 to $80K cars ""off the lot"" and [non-permissible content removed] for three years about the color or that it didn't come with that ONE special feature (which was an option) that drew them to the car in the first place.Of course those of us who do order cars are pretty rare, so I understand all the reasons you may think the dealer ""saw me coming."" My repeat purchases from the same dealership did have something to do with my sense that I got the best price on a custom ordered car, too, I would assume. You may feel if you go into the dealership to order a car that you'll be screwed -- well I guess that is possible, but most dealerships have a very small or zero deposit policy on ordered cars and many of the ELLPS and LPS brands don't even want any deposit. Furthermore, if you order a car and you change your mind, I know of nothing that can be done to compel you to take the car -- and even if you have a deposit placed on your new ordered car, if you change your mind they will refund your money, unless you signed some kind of binding contract stating that you will lose your deposit if you bail.I also get the desire for instant gratification -- so if you want to buy off the lot, have at it. I do believe you will be happier if you order your car exactly as you want it though. And another cool thing about ordering the car: you get the thrill (mostly) of buying the thing twice, once when you order it and once again when it FINALLY comes in 3 or 4 months later.While this thing is still on -- I love manual transmissions; if all car companies from this day forward only offered stick shifts, I would be OK with that, especially in German cars. On the other hand, if all car companies from this day forward only offered two-pedal cars, I'd be fine with that too, because THAT's how good these 6, 7& 8 speed autotrans are these days.Pretty soon, there will be no debate needed -- at least here in the US -- for the number of stick shift cars actually available is small (and hardly ever on the lot) and getting smaller from what I can tell.

"dino001","May 2012"," With you, Mark. The only difference here was deposit - had put put in $2500 and it was non-ref. And dealer act like it's a favor. Which is probably, why some people are too scared and too turned off to do it. So then you hear just like you wrote ""It's exactly what I wanted - except it's black (wanted blue) with grey leather (wanted beige), doesn't have Nav, or sunroof. Otherwise, perfect. :surprise: :sick: "
"dino001","May 2012"," The manual tranny situation is also because it is just one variable in the config. So because people buy off the lot and because majority buys autos, those who would not mind (or even prefer) manuals, have hard time to find one with manual and other stuff matching their preference even remotely. So they go there and buy auto, convincing themselves they got a great deal and the resale will be better (which may be true, but again - is the car for you or the next guy). Which in turn, shrinks the manual market even more to the point manufacturers give up offering them. It is chicken and egg issue: there aren't many around, so people don't buy them - but because ""nobody"" buys them, there aren't any...  "
"nyccarguy","May 2012"," While my car was a leftover when I got it, there were certain compromises I was willing to make. The majority of 328xis on dealer lots (there were thousands of them) were built by BMW for the specific purpose of ""cheap leasing."".

"flightnurse","May 2012"," Dino what was the reason for the deposit, did the dealer tell you? As I have posted we have been looking at a new 5 series or 7 series, of course it would be ordered how we want it. So far the dealer has told us no deposit needed. "
"graphicguy","May 2012"," Flight...before my 335i was found sitting at port, my dealer had already ordered exactly what I wanted.....no deposit required.

"
"dino001","May 2012"," Standard procedure for special orders, especially for cars like stick shift wagon. If I were to stand them up, who'd buy it? Now, if I wanted a coupe or convertible, they may not want one, I don't know. Anyway, I was prepared to pay it, anyway. To me it is completely reasonable to want a deposit if a customer wants something you know may not sell for a year. It's not a matter of price, it's matter of market demand for a particular product. "
"sweendogy","May 2012"," DinoIs there a way to order a car directly from the company, and not the dealer?What type of discount from msrp can one expect, if any.? "
"dino001","May 2012"," No there isn't - absolutely no. BMW is actually one of the stronger supporters of its dealer networks (i.e. it is very good to be their dealer). My German liason in BMW Welt told me they were last ones from German manufacturers to introduce factory center pickup, mostly due to concerns over their dealers. And they really stress the origin dealer, even during delivery process (on monitors of upcoming deliveries there is name and dealer). It comes from history - BMW was rescued by a consortium of investors and dealer during its near bancruptcy experience (I think it was 50s) - they basically put the money to prevent the takeover by Daimler Benz. Discount? I basically got $1000 off the Euro Delivery MSRP, which is 93% of base US MSRP plus full MSRP on options. Not a supreme deal by any means. If I were more aggressive, I might have got extra $500, maybe tad more, but there were additional circumstances around this order, which you can read in Sales Frontlines board - I wrote it around September (in the nutshell I was driving dealer's 328i loaner for over two weeks, which adds some value). Tampa dealers are not very ""discounty"", especially on orders. At time of the order, 2012 was in production, there weren't even special interest/lease offers published.Here is the main difference: currently BMW runs some cash incentives, both dealer's and customer's on existing inventory. Those incentives often have short expirations (month or so), which basically means they cannot be guaranteed on orders. They often get extended, but there is no guarantee. Moreover, none of them apply to Euro Delivery.This are in nutshell reasons why orders get this ""doing you a favor"" attitude. No instant gratification, no instant money who knows what it will be then, so if you want it, you pay. I did, but I can see why others won't. The differential can be too compelling to ignore, especially if you don't really care if it's black or grey, or if it has sunroof or not. I do care more than most - and knowing my taste is off-mainstream, I have to adjust pricing expectations. I'm OK with that, as long as it is reasonable and in return I get right treatment. My salesman was an impressive middle-aged gentlemen with manners worthy the premium brand (e.g. every morning he recorded time-stamped voice mail greeting every work day, so you'd know if he is at work that day, or not). When you see manners like that, it is a little easier to part with the money, if you know what I mean. "
"sweendogy","May 2012"," Dino- thanks for the detailed response - very good color on the process- the special circumstance you had and the way they responded for sure has great value- I've read on some BMW blogs that owners were paying 500-1000 over invoice for special orders, dont know the validity of these statements or if they included options, which can add up quick on these cars.I've mentioned before I've seen ONE m packaged 3 wagon in my work parking lot and I liked the looks and to see a wagon with a 6 speed is so cool. You have any pix of yours - would love to see how it looks - one I saw was black. "
"dino001","May 2012"," I do, I just don't know how to post it on Edmunds. Tried couple of times and gave up. From the instructions it looked like I have to put it on some website first. Makes no sense to me. :confuse:I was waffling on M-pack a bit, it does add some nice spank (especially from the front view). But I guess I was too cheap. Regular sports packages was good enough for me, as in RWD it comes with suspension, just like M-pack (xi versions do not get it, they require M-pack), so the difference between sports and M was only visual for RWD. Nice, but too much money. I got convenience package instead (adaptive xenons, manual shades, keyless entry and start, automatic lights). "
"dino001","May 2012"," Finally, looks like I'm able to do it. I had to post it on Facebook first. It seems strange. Anyway, it is how it looked from above in BMW Welt. The color is Deep Sea Blue. I love it - has great depth in it - it actually changes in different lighting conditions, always looking sharp, just from dark to less dark. Black leather, dark wood, premium, sports, convenience packs, nav. - and as you all know, all with a stick shift. The roof rails were a nice surprise (they are solid black, well blending into the car, almost invisible), and the INSANE panoramic sunroof (standard in the trim). Even my salesaman didn't know the sunroof was panoramic. Just amazing. It's been six months now and I still grin every time I sit behind the wheel - correction, every time I look at it. "

"flightnurse","May 2012"," Graphic I wouldn't expect BMW not to be able to sell your ordered car and I don't think it counts towards their allotment of cars either. "
"flightnurse","May 2012"," I agree, I forgot you had the Wagon with a stick, yes, a config car like that. Was your deposit refundable? "
"dino001","May 2012"," My understanding is only Euro deliveries don't count toward allotments. Regular orders do. When I was first ordering my wagon, the salesman mentioned something about allotment ""trade"" with another dealer. It later became moot, once we went with Euro delivery. "
"dino001","May 2012"," No, it wasn't. In practicality, if there were some true life circumstances, they'd probably return it, but at their goodwill. "
"flightnurse","May 2012"," Dino interesting, you say that you saved about a grand off MSRP, did you do the Euro Delivery? I do not remember. When I did the Euro Delivery on my 05 I saved roughly $2300. The savings really did pay for our trip, minus airfare (I used FF miles for that.) Of course when you look at 5 and 7 series the discount is greater, when we were looking at a 7 series the discount was $7700 for a euro delivery. "
"dino001","May 2012"," I see I confused you, people. It was $1000 off the ""Euro delivery"" MSRP, not US delivery MSRP. BMW maintains separate pricing sheets for each type of delivery. They both have same invoice-MSRP structure. delivery Euro prices are negotiable same way as US delivery prices. Here is the deal, more less:Base MSRP for 328i wagon is $38,395, Euro MSRP = 0.93*38,395=$35,700Options: $8550 (same for each type of delivery)Totals: US del: 46945, Euro del: 44250. My price: 43250, incuding dealer's fee. Of course add taxes.So it is about $4000 less than US MSRP, but I have to pay the trip to Munich. When I say ""discount"", in context of Euro delivery, it has the same meaning as ""discount"" in context in US delivery, but from lowered base. It is because the base is lowered not by the dealer's good heart, but by BMW of US. This is main difference between BMW and Mercedes, Audi, or Volvo European deliveries. BMW has the prices negotiable, the other ones have the prices fixed, no negotiations. Is that more clear now?  "

"dino001","May 2012"," Not that I really need validation  , but it is nice to hear others like it, too. I appreciate it.It's just too bad that ""general public"" doesn't buy those here - BMW is pretty last one standing, especially throughout 3-series line (almost, anyway). Audi ditched their A4 manual on wagon a few years ago, Benz was first to bow out completely. There were noises of wagon (touring) being replaced by 3-series GT (like in 5-series) but it seems not just yet. It seems GT may come as an additional line. I woulnd't mind that at all, especially if it were sold as a complete line, i.e. both engines, both trannies - one can dream, right? Cause the only thing I miss from BMW is the 335i touring - they sell those in Europe (or at leat did for E91, can's say for F31). That thing must be insane If I had to buy again, I could buy either one, I even like those liftbacks (GT-style) a little bit more than wagons; they are quite popular in Europe for D-segment (as they call all cars in size of 3-series). The body has more sedanish look, but comes with a full rear hatch, so larger cargo can be placed just like in a regular wagon or hatchback. Good combination. Previous generation Mazda6 was like that - of course didn't sell very well here so they ditched it. "
"flightnurse","May 2012"," I have to agree, when they presented us with the paperwork and ""great"" deal on airfare, i saw that the fare bucket for the ticket was not one to be able to upgrade from, I knew it wasn't a good deal. "
"sweendogy","May 2012"," It's a shame that your car is last in class- it seems the BMW botheren- while talking a great game, of being real drivers- has gone away from manuals- even thou they have the option ( other auto makers in he class don't) of man transmission - the sweet lease option of a 328 has gotten alot of so called enthuiaists into this car and class- gbozen and others who feel the auto is a better choice feast your eyes on a great BMW wagon - but congrats on the auto ""winning.""- your grandmas would be proud "

"dino001","May 2012"," Man, let that go, will you? Can we just get along?The thing with the ""companion"" fare was it requires you buy a booking code of full fare (Y or similar) for first ticket - but many tickets are available at deep (Q, T, Z or similar) that are about 50% of full fare, often even less.

"flightnurse","May 2012"," Sweeny no one stated that autos are better, we are saying that, the auto have gotten just as good as a stick. Performance speaking stick were much better in the 0-60 and mpg game (ten years ago), however, the autos of today are just as good.

"flightnurse","May 2012"," Dino, as you know the 2-1 is only good on the Euro Delivery not a inventory sale. "
"dino001","May 2012"," My preference of stick shift has nothing to do with performance, track times, 0-60. I'm not that good of a driver to actually take advantage of the edge, even if it existed. I don't prefer it because of the fuel economy, as modern autos are either better or almost as good (depending on who makes them). My preference for stick shift is only about one thing - it is feel of a connection between the throttle pedal and wheels, feedback that can be provided only by a mechanincal grip (direct friction) between clutch plates. No matter what, fluid driven by fins (in a classic hydrokinetic transmission, aka torque converter) will give you different feel. I've never driven DSG/SMG/DCT, but I can only imagine those transmissions as being the only equivalent device to facilitate similar feel you get from manual transmission. I could let go the pedal, it's the connection I'd miss if switched to normal slushbox. To be completely fair, the slushbox on the 328i loaner, I had for couple of weeks came, close to what I'd consider acceptable replacement. It was really first premium segment car I had opportunity to drive for more extended time and I almost liked the transmission. I opted for the manual simply because it was possibly last chance I still had an option(same with the six-in-line engine, BTW). I'm resigned to strong possibility of getting a slushbox for my next car - hopefully long time from now. It's not going to be ""terrible"", or anything like that - just a little sad, that's all. End of an era. But since there was a stay of the execution, I used it. "

"stickguy","May 2012"," quite possible they wil consolidate. In theory, a lot of overlap with the 3 models (heck, 4 if the Rl is still around!). so logically you cold replace the Ilx, TSX and TL with 2 models. Given that the I is just out, I assume the TSX would be the causualty? "
"billyperksii","May 2012"," That's all speculations- I dont see them discontiuing the TL, the TSX, probably-with the addition of the ILX, the TSX is a redundant car now. "

"dino001","May 2012"," There is no way TL will go. TSX is definitely the one, if something goes. I think the US market is just too small and too tough to support car like that. It probably costs them too much vs. what they can charge in volumes those things are selling. I actually like it, but I know when I like something, it won't sell. ILX being based on economy car spreads the costs much better. The problem I cannot see how in the world they could make anything close to TSX experience with ILX. The thing is based on Civic platform :sick: whereas TSX was based on Euro/JDM Accord, which were positioned similarly to US ELLPS (and sold at appropriate prices). So you know the pedigree of TSX is much more noble than coming ILX. This is just another example of Acura and Honda losing their way. They are undoubtedly going through some kind of crisis. "

"markcincinnati","May 2012"," I don't see Acura stopping the slide out of the premium class if the emphasis (based on dealer inventory) continues on obviously tarted up Hondas (no matter how nice) with FWD and 5 or 6 speed autos.My opinion is that Acura needs to offer the entire lineup with SH-AWD and nothing less than a 6spd auto, moving toward 8spd autos (and if possible keeping stick shifts if for no other reason than marketing.)The direction Acura seems to be moving is to build nice cars -- that neither offend (once the beak styling is banished to at least the '12 TL level if not moreso) nor excite (visually at least.) The current and apparent upcoming future direction is to slowly continue to slide out of the Premium class. One $100,000+ NSX doesn't change anything.Driving my 2012 TL SH-AWD Advance is very much like driving the previous generation Audi A6 (known as the C6), perhaps a 2009 or 2010 model.That may be damning with faint praise or it may be simply mild, not wild praise that Acura in 2012 can build a decent 2009 Audi A6 clone (that isn't as good looking.)In two years I move to a new car -- at this point Acura will get a look-see, but I'm thinking so will Infiniti and Audi and Cadillac. The Acura will have to step up its game.Today, Acura reminds me, in the pecking order of the world, as the Japanese VW. :confuse: "

"dino001","May 2012"," I agree. In my opinion Acura's issues are reflection of its parent Honda problems. I'm not sure if it is simple funding, excessive aversion to risk, or what it is, but their recent offerings are really so unispiring that it seems like they're sliding into second tier (Honda) or even oblivion (Acura). "
"flightnurse","May 2012"," Interesting that you bring up the Integra, it was based somewhat on the Civic, but the ILX is a civic in a pretty dress. So we shall see how it sells, if Honda can't sell the new Civic, then Acura will have a harder time selling the ILX.. The buyer they are shooting for is a very savoy buyer, doubt they will spend 31K for a ILX when they can buy a 2 yr old BMW for the same price... Honda has some problem, the Insight is not selling, the current Accord hasn't sold in the #'s that honda was looking for, the current Civic was cheapened and it shows. Lets hope that Honda gets it right soon, or they might be in a world of hurt.Acrua should have made the ILX into something that the Integra was, a sporty entry level upsacle car... Not a luxury car, but an upscale car. "
"flightnurse","May 2012"," Hey Fed, I have stated before that Acrua needs to drop the turbo 4 in the TSX, make it a low pressure turbo, 225hp with 240lbs of torque. this would give the TSX the need off the line power it has been lacking. Drop the V6, and if Acrua thinks a AWD version is needed, just increase the boost of the turbo to counter act the added weight. Have a Dual Clutch Auto with, have the 0-60 times in the high 5's... Keep the price right about 35K, Acrua would sell every since one of them... "

Not too sure what you are looking at, however, this is a nice savings. "
"sweendogy","May 2012"," I agree turbo 4 seems the way to go but it looks like Acura Killed the turbo in the rdx and now has a standard 6. It has Nothing to do with the transmission, duel clutch might be nice but as you and another have mentioned its not the reason they are going the way of the Dodo bird. Sports update rangers lose, yanks up 3-0.The Acura brand as stated before is the Asian Buick of this segment. No coupe, no convert, one standout with the mdx. NSx will be cool to see at the dealerships- but going to take more then a commercial with Jerry and Leno to get people to buy. "
"flightnurse","May 2012"," Acrua (Honda) could not do anything wrong, which was nice, the original NSX was years ahead of the competition, it is not uncommon to find a early NSX with 150K miles on it that is squeak free and runs like it is new. The early MDX the same thing, built very well, styling was typical Japanese you either loved it or hate it. Acrua (Honda) of today has made some big mistakes, and it shows. Their sales have dropped, cars that were the benchmark are not today. Placing a V6 in the TSX was the biggest mistake for them. The price places the V6 TSX in BMW territory.

"fedlawman","May 2012"," Parts and service are expensive, but service visits are infrequent with proper care. They are built like tanks and very reliable if taken care of. Quality is just amazing - they are simply one of the best built, most durable cars on the road. I can't speak for modern Porsches, but in my opinion, air-cooled 911's were purpose built to go fast and be driven hard. 911's that sit and sit are the ones that break down. Drive it often and hard and it just asks for more. Mostly hand built, pre-996 911's were designed to last a lifetime if properly maintained.The key is preventative maintenance.

"nyccarguy","May 2012"," Fedlawman - my Mom has a 2011 Cayenne & I am absolutely blown away by how well it is screwed together. Every little detail is perfectly thought out, from the exhaust note @ start up to the metal seat adjustment controls. I haven't driven it, but the ride is perfectly taut & crisp. To keep the post on topic, I do wish Porsche would come out with a car in this ELLPS segment. "
"fedlawman","May 2012"," Taut and crisp is a great way to describe it. It's like how you buy a new car and it feels so solid and tight with perfectly damped steering, suspension, shifter, etc. Then a year or two later, you're driving along and you think how it's still great, but it doesn't have that new feeling anymore. Well, my 17 year-old Porsche feels like that new car - I can only imagine what it felt like back in 1995.I suspect that Audi has the ELLPS segment pretty much locked up for Porsche. Porsche would have to make a car that sells for under $50,000 (OK, the Boxster starts at $49,999 - or whatever), and that just won't happen. "
"graphicguy","May 2012"," While I haven't been kind in voicing my opinions about Mercedes, it looks like they are actually throwing a legit contender into this field. While I thought they were taken the C class in the wrong direction by having a performer even more tepid than the C300 in the C250, they also have announced a C 350 coupe (even available with 4Matic). I'll be interested in reading some reviews about it. "

"
"flightnurse","May 2012"," Hey Fed, have you decoded your option list? http://www.kindel.com/porsche/options/options.asp "
"plekto","May 2012"," The reason they break down if they are not revved hard is due to a design flaw in the engines. Well, it's not a design flaw, so much as that they were designed with European oils in mind that have proper levels of additives. As well as being run at higher speeds and rpms. When the EPA forced oil companies to drop their levels of Zinc DialkylDithiophosphate (usually just referred to as ""Zinc"") to 1200ppm, they started to show increased wear. With the move to 800ppm, it's only a matter of time before the engine eats itself if you run it like a typical yuppie. Why? The engines are designed with tight internal clearances that require high pressures to force oil into and out of the parts, especially the lower output bearings. You just have to learn to be happy running it at 4-5KRPM all the time. Yes, that means running around town in 2nd gear and making some noise. :Phttp://www.lnengineering.com/ims.htmlThe problem with the engines in detail (ignore the hyperbole and marketing and focus on the pictures and technical parts). Low RPMs=early death. Since the design requires higher rpms/pressure to lubricate, but oil simply starts to fail at those higher pressures that result (6000+rpm), your only fail-safe is high zinc levels. If the oil doesn't have it, well... Your engine blows its bearings at 40-50K miles.Note - this affects motorcycles, rotary engines, and smaller engines like the S2000 that rev past 6K rpm routinely. Normal SAE approved oils won't cut it. Thankfully Valvoline and a few others make higher level conventional oils. Most are marketed as ""high mileage"" oils. This is a nice trick, btw - always use the high mileage oil even in a new engine - as well as good conventional oil instead of synthetic if the engine does any sort of higher RPMs. "
"fedlawman","May 2012"," Very good post plekto! There has been a lot of talk about reduced ZDDP levels over the years on the internet, but not so much around here. Quite an oversight IMO given the sticker price of a typical ELLPS.It wasn't just the EPA. Auto manufacturers and consumers who demand longer service intervals and longer emission system warranties are also to blame.As you mentioned, choosing ""high mileage oil"" is a good decision, but doesn't guarantee higher levels of ZDDP. Lots of owners have switched to motorcycle oil, racing oil, and even diesel engine oil as more and more ""recommended"" oils have changed in formulation. Anyone buying an ELLPS who intends to keep it past the warranty period is well advised to research their oil and not assume that Mobil 1 or the other ""top of the line"" synthetics offer adequate protection.My last oil change was Shell Helix Ultra. Brad Penn ""Green"" is another recommended oil. Mobil 1 has a few too (15W-50 and Racing/V-Twin, for example):http://www.mobiloil.com/USA-English/MotorOil/Files/Mobil_1_Product_Guide.pdf "
"ivan_99","May 2012"," heh, I like your style Porsche talk...there is a higher speed yield that I go through everyday. Usually if I'm lucky there isn't traffic and I can take it at a higher speed.Today I got spanked by a Porsche Cayman. My IS 350 is sporty...but not a sports car. I was behind and he just cruised through the curve flat and fast. By comparison (at that speed) I felt like I was going to tip over He (assuming it was a he...self preservation of ego) was gone before I could regain my composure.Sad thing...last year a prev-gen M3 sedan showed me it's tail lights through the same yield :surprise: "
"plekto","May 2012"," The issue is two-fold on the oil.One is that some engines require higher internal pressures and rpms to adequately lubricate the engine as well as properly seat the rings during break-in. That is, not all engines are like your old Buick with its 3.8. Some just don't respond well to being lugged all the time.The second is that oils fail at certain pressures and temperatures. You can see where this is going. If the levels of ZDDP are too low, the oil cooks itself and there's nothing to fall back on. (high revs will cook the oil anyways, that's normal) For a higher revving engine that sees 4K+rpm on a regular basis, you need at least a thousand PPM. For something that is in the 5-6K+ range, like a rotary or small engine, even 1200ppm won't really cut it. Most racing oils are at 1500-1600. They will kill your cat in 5 years. So be it - a cat is much cheaper than an engine rebuild. "
"fedlawman","June 2012"," My 2004 TSX visited its 7000 RPM redline on a frequent basis when I owned it. I didn't know anything about oil back then and simply used regular Mobil 1.I'm guessing most ELLPS owners here don't plan on keeping their cars more than 4 or 5 years, so it's the CPO and used buyers that should be wary. "
"nyccarguy","June 2012"," I drove the current generation Lexus IS at a Lexus driving event. Their big selling point was that their IS had a 306 hp V6 engine which was more than any other car in the class. They showed their IS350 shredding the pants off of a ""lowly"" 255 hp 330i. Little did they know BMW's N54 powered 335i was soon to be released. Anyway, they only offered a 6 speed stick with the sluggish IS250. They only offered AWD with the IS250, which made the car even more sluggish. I've literally only seen 4 IS350s since 2006. Every IS ""round these here parts"" is an IS250 AWD.There's a dude named louisweis (& our own ivan_99) here on edmunds that has an IS350 with all kinds of F Sport goodies. He tracks the car & really loves it!I think it is eating away @ Lexus that they couldn't build a better competitor. I'm sure they got their hands on an F30 328i so they could TRY and tune their next IS to drive like it.Ivan_99 - would you buy another IS350? "
"ivan_99","June 2012"," Ivan_99 - would you buy another IS350?I wouldn't buy the one currently being offered because it is virtually the same as mine; a 2006. Mine was a CPO (which is now expired). It's in surprisingly good condition but its about time to replace it. Not certain what the new one will be like; I haven't been impressed with any of the new Lexus styling whatsoever.Down here in central TX I see many...many IS's; I obviously didn't get it for its exclusivity I had a brief stint with a Q45 before this so it was much more sporty in comparison.There were just a few things about the IS that kept bothering me. Normal shifting was very lethargic (think Corolla stuck in sand) and sport-mode was very un-Lexus like harsh and abrupt. Handling, such as a large sweeping yield I mentioned above, made it lean and plow to the outside. Short quick transitions feel fine and responsive.If I had to give my IS a grade it would be an 'ok'...a 75%I may not go for another ELLPS.I'm torn in what I want. Part of me wants to go 'all out sport' and get a used 911, but currently I do not get many opportunities to explore any driving excitement. I use my car to commute...and that is it. I sit in traffic for the most part inching along. I 'live' for the odd (clear) yield or on ramp, but in the evening and weekend my car just sits. A new Ford Focus would probably be just as rewarding.I use our other vehicle (mini-van) more often because we have young kids in sports. So when I take my boys to football I need the room for all their gear and room to sit. Sometimes they'll leave their cleats on...in the back of the IS it doesn't work well.Plus...I've had knee problems lately so getting in and out of the IS (even sitting) is not very enjoyable. I need something with a more upright position. I probably need to spend time sitting in each vehicle as there are so many variation in body style, seat style, etc.I'm leaning towards an SUV...or simple commuter vehicle. "

"nyccarguy","June 2012"," Grow fonder. Last week my Dad tells me the AC in his Tahoe (2011 w/ 5700 miles). No problem, since he just bought the truck in March. He doesn't like the dealer near his house, so we make an appointment at the dealer near my house where he bought the car. I drop the car off on Tuesday & pickup a loaner. The easiest thing for us to do is just switch cars.So for those of you keeping score; on the hottest day of the year so far (mid 90's & brutally humid), I go to work in my 328xi. I leave work in a Black/Black Tahoe with no AC & am given a 2010 or so Malibu (with working AC). My Dad gets to take my BMW home. He definitely got the better end of this bargain. Long story short, the dealer fixes the AC (leaking line seals) & I drive the Tahoe to work the next day. I get my BMW back after being without it for 2 days. It is just a pleasure to drive, even if I'm creeping along in bumper to bumper traffic.Ivan_99 - I don't know what your budget is, but since you are confident with CPO cars have you considered a used Cayenne? Besides my Mom's 2011, I have a customer with an '05 V6 Cayenne. The 1st problem he had with the car (front differential needed replacing) just happened @ 150K miles. The car hardly looks its age or mileage. They do eat tires & brakes though.Whatever you end up with, keep us informed. "
"flightnurse","June 2012"," Ivan my main problem with the IS is it's tight seating space, even up front. I can see if you are having physical limitation getting in and out would be a problem, if you are not comfortable driving the car it is not worth driving it. The Focus looks to be a fun car, even when it's not moving and with the Ford bring over the Focus ST this would be an interesting car to have.BTW, you wouldn't be in Austin would you? "
"flightnurse","June 2012"," NYC the Cayenne needs a new front Differential!!!! That wont be cheap.... is it worth fixing since the value of the cayenne is about 7K (or so) I know we aren't suppose to talk about Porsche's, however, I have been curious about the Cayenne and how they are holding up, I guess 150K is a good amount of driving with no problems until now. "
"ivan_99","June 2012"," have you considered a used CayenneI have, the minor redesign from 08-10 seems to be going for a reasonable price.e.g. Certified 08 for 33k, 08 with 18k mi for $35k...09 & 10 certified up to 45kish. It's hard to nail down a good price for a used Porsche...so many options.Problem with ""used"" is I like the new models  which is one of the reasons I went with the IS. I knew they'd have a long model cycle and I wouldn't be stuck with a payment for the 'old' one. "
"sweendogy","June 2012"," Don't worry flight, I think it's been established its fine to talk about it. On the Porsche truck - i drove a 2009 gts- wicked fast tight in the turns but not a real Porsche - its a truck. I also thought the interior setup for an 80k car seemed low rent. My buddy has had 3 since they can out - first turbo- the the gts I speak of - now has another turbo- he loves them "
"ivan_99","June 2012"," The IS is a little tight (6'3"" 250 ish...). I have to lean the seat back a bit and sometimes my head hits the driver hand-grab.I usually find the German cars are more generous with head room; I drove a new ""man"" beetle with plenty headroom...same with the older Golf/Rabbit.The ST did get my attention. It reminds me of the Audi (VW) 2.0T in its various forms; good torque slight burble/grumble when you open it up.Yup, Austin, one of the options I wish I had was the cooled seats (I recall the CTS having great ones). Nothing worse than having your forehead frozen (not enough head room for the air to circulate) and your back sweaty in the TX heat (Friday parking lot temp...109).I generally prefer smaller cars. My first car as a teenager was an old (13 year old) 924 (tough to maintain a Porsche on a dishwasher salary  ). It may be the years setting in...but I recently drove a new Explorer and though...wow...nice room  "
"stickguy","June 2012"," you sound like a perfect candidate for a compact/sporty CUV. The new RDX (acura) is very nice. Maybe an Infiniti EX? still compact and sporty, but sits higher and has some cargo flexibility. Not a huge cargo area, but enough for the kids gear. And it drives nice. "
"nyccarguy","June 2012"," The front differential was a big ticket replacement. Cost him $3K. 1st gen Cayennes are very heavy vehicles, so they do eat through tires & brakes. There's also a rubber seal (or bushing maybe) attached to the drive shaft that goes bad & when it does, warrants the drive shaft replacement ($1200).The customer's Cayenne is an '05 that he bought CPO in '06 with 9K miles. He's currently over the 150K mile mark. "
"flightnurse","June 2012"," Ivan like you I'm 6', 260ish and I don't fit in the IS at all. The original 924 the hybrid of Porsche and Audi parts...I was working in Austin last summer at one of St. Davids hospitals I really had a great time there, Austin was one city that my partner and I thought about moving to, but the drought really changed that for us. I do miss my weekly Franklin BBQ fix... When I stopped going to Austin I was really jonesing for it.. Very addictive BBQ. "
"flightnurse","June 2012"," Hey Stick my partner has a Nissan Rogue the biggest negative issue he has with it is review visibility, even if you turn your head when making lane changes there are some big blind spots. Again the EX is a very tight fit upfront and once the seat is push all the way back, there is no room behind the driver. Acura I think made a big mistake with the new RDX, taking the turbo away and using a V6 wasn't the way to fix it's issues. "
"m6user","June 2012"," Acura I think made a big mistake with the new RDX, taking the turbo away and using a V6 wasn't the way to fix it's issues. Acura is selling the living H out of the new RDX. I've been looking seriously at it to replace an Infiniti SUV and am impressed. The old RDX was built for guys that wanted a racy SUV. Not a lot of those out there despite what you read in this forum. The old RDX rides like a truck, has serious turbo lag, sucks gas like a pig and had a low rent interior and questionable styling. The new V6 runs smooth and gets class leading MPG, the interior is on par with the rest of the Acura line now. The only complaint I see is the styling is similar from the side to the CR-V but the front and rear are totally different and looks good IMO. People lament about the loss of SH-AWD but few people that wanted a more compact 5 psg. luxury CUV cared that much about it....they just wanted AWD for winter traction.Bottom line - a FEW enthusiusts, that [non-permissible content removed] more than actually bought them, will miss the old turbo and SH-AWD but a HUGE number of buyers love the new model. So Acura is loving it. "
"stickguy","June 2012"," you nailed it on the head. It went from being a serious niche player, to a dominant one in the class. I have very little experience with the old model, but from everything I read my wife would not like it.sure, it got softer but it still handles well, and the engine is much better suited to it now. And for 99% of the buyers, the changes ""fixed"" the problems they saw (but some others like Flight considered its strengths).and it seems to have the sweet spot almost to itself. A step above the mainstream stuff (CRV, etc.) with a lot more power and luxo ""stuff"", but still way cheaper than a comparably equipped BMW/Audi.I have seen it called a mini-MDX for a lot less money, and that is probably a fair description. "
"m6user","June 2012"," I think it's main comp. is Lexus RX350 and when configured similarly the Lexus is about $5+k more and gets worse MPG. The Lexus has more storage room in back but not enough IMO to make a big difference. I've driven the RDX and love the compact turning circle, smooth engine and it has tons of legroom in the rear seat which suprized me. It handles the curves pretty well too. I like it but right now they are just selling them too fast to get a decent deal in the color/options one wants. I can wait a while. While at the dealer I also checked out the TL. Loved that too but after driving a SUV for so long it felt like I was dropping in and climbing out of a bathtub every time I got out and in. Seems to sit pretty low even with the seat adjusted up but that could very well just be my perception. "
"sweendogy","June 2012"," ""went from a niche player, to a dominate one."" while I've never driven the new rdx - I would like to see sales numbers to support this claim. It seems Acura just dropped the 6 into an existing car so it didn't have to produce a gas chewer turbo 4- sure they cleaned up the interior but has this cAr really changed- love the non-Ellps banter on this Elpps chat- "
"m6user","June 2012"," while I've never driven the new rdx Short answer...yes. If you haven't spent some time in it and the old one, it would be hard to comment. I said it's selling like crazy right now but it's premature to say it's ""dominant"". But all indications are they have a winner finally in this small CUV. Hey, I guess the ELLP(CUV) is as pertinent as the 2 dr. sports car that's been talked about.  "
"sweendogy","June 2012"," But you havent driven it or seen the sales numbers- do I'm sticking with my comment unless its a proven sales giant as the Lexus- I drove the old rdx and the golf based vw Tiguan- and the vw was a better small ute - in every way "

For you to say you've talking to salesmen about a car they sell is like me talking to a priest - they are trying to sell you something.I hope the car does well- but it's got a long way to go before becoming a serious player- The Ellps category has expanded overnight "
"m6user","June 2012"," In many forums here on Edmunds people copy and paste and then bold to indicate a quote. This is one of the few I don't see it much. If this is about the only forum you frequent I can see how you mistook my quote from you. I know the salesman very well and believe what he says. He also told me the ILX was not doing well at all and may not even be around after a couple of years. He's pretty upfront and little BS, retired state trooper whom I've known for some time.It will be interesting to see what Acura keeps the TSX or ILX or both. I think if they put the 2.4L in the base ILX it would probably sell pretty well. As it is, it is underpowered for luxury or near-luxury model. "
"stickguy","June 2012"," I was at the acura dealer Saturday looking at the RDX, and on the way out (walking next to sales guy) I glanced at the sticker on the ILX on the floor (not actually bad looking, but yes, it screamed economy car to me!_ and it was ~32k. Not sure which model, but it had an AT so not the hot rod version.I commented ""expensive Civic"" and he looked pained, and mumbles something about there were lots of changes to the platform, but he didn't really sound too enthusiastic about it! "
"m6user","June 2012"," Yeah, the base platform is the same but everything else is different. Suspension, drivetrain, body, interior....pretty much everything. People that say it's just a upgraded Civic really haven't looked at the car or specs carefully. The 2.0 puts out like 150hp which is just not competitive. The car, IMO, is actually pretty nice looking and has a nice interior befitting of an Acura, not the crap that is the Civic interior with all apologies to Civic owners. It's just weak. If they upgrade to the base to a 2.4L later on it may be attractive. People expect some grunt with their luxury. It still could be competitive MPG wise with 200hp I think. "

"fedlawman","June 2012"," I agree Graphicguy.It's the ""what have you done for me lately"" syndrome combined with the fact that the Europeans have made big strides while Acura has been resting on their laurels.The current Acura lineup is good, but Acura should not be satisfied with just good.Acura needs a good entry-level car (like the aforementioned ILX with 2.4L), a sporty RWD/AWD mid-level car (like a ""TLX"" with 3.5L) and a large top of the line RWD/AWD sedan like the RLX.

So far haven't seen in NY (Lawn Guyland), but so see the new CR-V (in borh cities.) One would assume if they are selling the hell out of them, I would be seeing them on the roads in Phoenix and in NY, so far this isn't the case. "
"flightnurse","June 2012"," Ivan, the problem the ILX will have is it is based off the Civic, Place an upgraded interior in it which is fine, but if you park a Civic and ILX next to each other you will see the similarities. If one is going to spend (cough) 32K for a ILX, it better not look like a 18K Honda Civic. Acura built the ILX to get the Gen X'er into their brand, but for 32K one can buy a CPO 328i and have a much better brand identity and better warranty. The ILX's price needs to be less then 30K for a top of the line if they want to be competitive with other sport/luxury brands. "
"flightnurse","June 2012"," Acura needs to stop marketing a line of ""luxury cars"" based on a FWD Honda platform. Period.It works for Lexus, why not Acura? RX/Highlander, ES/Camry, GX/4 Runner. LX/Land Cruiser. Now the GS isn't based on anything that Toyota sells here in the states, however, if you look at the new Toyota Avalon that will go on sale in a couple of months, there are lots of lines that are very similar. Granted the GS is RWD and the Avalon is FWD.Is it the dealership experience that sets apart Lexus and Acura? Or is it the way Lexus cars drive overall and people are willing to pay more for a Lexus then a Toyota version? "
"m6user","June 2012"," I have been actively looking at the RDX and driving it at several dealers. I've had to wait because the only one they had left was out being test driven. I have a guy I trust that sells Acura he tells me they are selling like crazy. I've stopped in several Chicago area Acura dealers and have yet to see all the colors because they have been selling them very quickly. My guy also says the ILX is not doing well so far but I guess he wouldn't know anything about that either. I think he bases his comments on first hand experience and customer interest versus how many he has seen on the road. You ask for sales data? Well, they have been on the lots for about a month give or take a few days. Just what sort of internet type data do you expect me to provide you with at this point in time. I just don't think any real data has been gathered yet. So until then, you'll just have to not believe me and wait!. Cr-Vs by the way have been out for over 8 months so I would expect you to see them. There is also the case where you might have seen them and didn't realize it. They now look like a slightly smaller version of the MDX and from a distance it is very hard to tell the difference. You really have to look at the lower grill in front and the exhaust pipes in back to tell the difference. Just walking around the new car lots it's a little difficult picking them out until you really zero in on the tailpipes or front facia.I remember when the new Focus first came out. I knew from everything I read that they were selling like crazy but it was a long time before I started noticing them on the road. "
"flightnurse","June 2012"," M6 no one is doubting what the sale's persons are saying, however, when you make a claim as you did, some data would be nice to look into. Regarding the lack of RDX's on the lot could mean two things, 1, yes, they are selling very well, or 2, Acura isn't shipping many of them at this time. So there is an illusion of them selling well. A quick check of a Acura dealer in Phoenix, has 13 RDX's, one happens to be a 2012. A quick check of a Acura dealer on Long Island (7 miles from me) has 35 2013 RDX's. Maybe the Chicago area likes the new RDX, but in Long Island so far they do not... "

"m6user","June 2012"," Thanks. Is that 2013 RDX or a combo of 2012 and 2013?

"fedlawman","June 2012"," The RX is their biggest seller, but it's not the topic of this discussion.2012 IS and GS sales are very strong.But FWIW, I wasn't talking about sales. Going by sales figures, you might believe that the Dodge Caliber is a world beater... :lemon: "
"flightnurse","June 2012"," The IS and GS are based off JDM Toyota's, the only non Toyota is the LS then. So if Lexus can make a go of it, Acura should also.I believe it has to be more with dealer experience then anything. Acura set the bar as far as the luxury car brands from Japan, however, Lexus has taken it to the next level. Infiniti almost closed up shop here because they did not explain what kind of car company it was, having ads with babbling brook, and streams wasn't tell Americans what kind of cars they built. Lexus wanted to be the #1 luxury brand in America they succeed until the Germans got their composure back and took it over again. "
"Kirstie_H","June 2012"," That's really not a good question for this particular discussion, since we focus on a variety of vehicles rather than the BMW 7-Series.

"m6user","June 2012"," This is something posted on cars.com today regarding the Acura RDX. I know it's still a little off topic but wanted to provide the info requested. ""The compact crossover just went on sale amid a major marketing campaign. May 2012 sales were nearly triple what they were in May 2011 at 3,301 units. That's more than the BMW X3 (2,460), Audi Q5 (2,332), Mercedes-Benz GLK-Class (2,133), Volvo XC60 (1,751) and Land Rover Range Rover Evoque (706). Only Cadillac's SRX did better with 3,900 units sold in May.""I've read that both the new X3 and the Q5 are pretty popular. So the RDX beating them handily now versus, I assume being beat by them last year, would indicate that Acura is selling a bunch even if you haven't seen any. "
"graphicguy","June 2012"," fed....we're on the same page. Acura has let the RL become an afterthought. I know whenever I went into my local dealership for service, if they had one RL to sell, I was surprised. They just didn't market them. On the other hand, what was there to market? The TL had everything the RL had, at a much lower price. While a bit of a stretch, it was almost like GM putting some baubles on a Cavalier and calling it a Cadillac.That said, it seems like Acura has gone out of its way to be ""different"" for difference's sake. I liked that with my TL. But, Civic vs ILS isn't going to win them any converts. Plus, the TL is now their flagship, for all intents and purposes.I believe they try to split the difference between the German lux marques and the American lux brands. Acuras are sportier than Lexus, but not as soorty as a BMW or Audi. Lexus has carved their own niche (which they're desperately trying to expand from with the ""F"" versions of their mundane cars.That said, you'd be hard pressed to find a more reliable, relatively inexpensive to operate, tech filled vehicle than an Acura.M6.....quite frankly, I've yet to hear any car sales person say that business was bad....at least not to a potential customer. I usually hear them say that every car they are trying to sell is ""in short supply"". It's that whole ""buy it now while it's hot"" syndrome.  "
"flightnurse","June 2012"," M6, it appears that Acura has a excellent lease rates, and 0.9% Financing right now, so this could also be why it is selling very well. It does look like a smaller version of the MDX, which BTW, is Acura top seller. I'm sure once the hype is done and the intro lease special is over with sales will settle down.The ILX doesn't look like has taken off, even though the lease price is about the same as the top end Civic. "
"stickguy","June 2012"," Those deals are for the outgoing 2012 model. The new 2013 doesn't have the subsidized leases, etc.as to the ILX, FWIW, by son (just turning 21, and just finished his Junior year at college) texted me last night that ""he just saw a commercial for the ilx and it looked pretty snazzy"".so just maybe there is hope to pull in a younger generation, and his dream is to get a BMW before I do!Of course, once he sees the price of a nicely equipped model, the fever will probably cool quickly. "
"m6user","June 2012"," ""it appears that Acura has a excellent lease rates, and 0.9% Financing right now, so this could also be why it is selling very well."" Gee, do you have any data data on this? So we go from dealers have tons of inventory and I haven't seen one so they are not selling well in Long Island and Phoenix to it is ""selling very well"". I don't think the heavy incentives are for the 2013, and if so, I'll let you do the research to see if Acura offered any incentives last year. Hey, if you don't like the Acura brand that's fine but at least be objective. "
"flightnurse","June 2012"," Stick you are right about the 0.9% is for the 2012, but the leases of $399 and $499 are for the 2013. Not bad for $2400 down, unlike BMW where they want $3500 to 4K down for those prices. "
"flightnurse","June 2012"," Gee, do you have any data data on this?http://www.acura.com/tools/shopping/CurrentOffers.aspx?model=RDX&modelYear=2013 "
"stickguy","June 2012"," I don't lease, but are those prices really that good with so much money down? and in my zip, the tech package lease is $449 with $3,800 at signing (inc. 1st payment I think). Both are FWD too, so add more $$ for the AWD option.but, the BMW is a lot more expensive, so even with another 1-1.5K up front, if the prices are about the same (monthly) then sounds like the BMW is a better deal. "
"m6user","June 2012"," I don't lease either so I really don't know if the lease prices are good or bad but can compare numbers. When you consider the BMW X3 similarly equipped is substantially more MSRP than the RDX, the deals are not that far apart so I would hardly say Acura is offering huge incentives to move product. "
"Kirstie_H","June 2012"," Well, it's not HUGE incentive, and I didn't see it described as such. It's just an excellent lease rate. BMW is known for offering excellent lease deals, too. I don't see great leasing deals as a big, ""oh no, we must do this to move product."" I see it as a business focus. Lease payments are generally lower than purchase payments, so it's a way to attract a segment of the market that might otherwise balk at product ownership - plus, if the consumer is new to consideration of the brand, it's a way to get them to ""sample"" the product for a few years without the downside of long-term ownership. "
"m6user","June 2012"," M6.....quite frankly, I've yet to hear any car sales person say that business was bad....at least not to a potential customer. I usually hear them say that every car they are trying to sell is ""in short supply"". Than you don't anyone personally in the business. I have a nephew that is an auto tech and a friend that I've known for years that sells Acuras. Both of which pretty much tell me how it is. Having purchased over 40(not leased) I think I can seperatge the truth from the flack and don't believe just ANY auto salesman. It's not like I walked into a dealership and was told something by some salesman I don't know and repeated it in these forums. Please give me more credit than that. "
"andys120","June 2012"," Acuras are sportier than Lexus, but not as soorty (sic) as a BMW or Audi.I don't know what standards you're using to establish ""sportiness"" but to me and many others any car with pretensions to sportiness should be RWD and since some Lexi are Rear-drive but Acuras aren't they are usually behind the curve in this respect.Acura's ads tout the technical enhancements of the car not their driving characteristics. For guys like me the tech toys are a secondary consideration at best. "
"flightnurse","June 2012"," I do not lease either, there is no advantage for me to lease, but I'm sure one could with a 700+ score get the same deal with less money out of pocket.The X3 has a better residual value then the RDX, last I saw the residual of a X3 was 53%, this was for a 3 year lease. "
"m6user","June 2012"," ""The X3 has a better residual value then the RDX""This is from a post by a host here at Edmunds that provides lease info.""Acura's April buy rate lease money factor and residual value for a 36-month lease of a 2013 RDX Base with 10,000 miles per year are .00190 and 67%, respectively for consumers who qualify for its top aka ""Super Preferred"" credit tier.""Cars.com has 51% for 2012 RDX and 47% for 2012 X3 for a 3 year lease.

AUDI""Only brands above the luxury average were ranked.I know the last one is of brands and not a specific model but it makes me wonder how an X3 could be higher than a RDX if the brand was not even in the top five. I couldn't find anything that indicated the X3 has a higher residual value then a RDX. Maybe you could shed some light on why you think that. "
"stickguy","June 2012"," 675 looks right. I looked at the terms and MSRP was ~$35,210 and the residual was $2,100 or so. Comes out to 67%.might help on the lease, but terrible if you wanted to buy it at the end! "

I've recommended the TL SH AWD to a lot of people. It's a great car, made even greater by the $$$$$ it sells for. I have to reiterate I guess. I'm aware that Lexus makes some distinctly un-sporty vehicles (RX/LS/ES) but since they make some good Rear Drive machinery and Acura has only got the new NSX most would say that in general Lexus is the sportier of the two. To put it another way a RWD IS is sportier to me than an AWD TSX and I think most would agree. with me "
"fedlawman","June 2012"," I don't think you can argue one is ""sportier"" than the other. Both lines have much to offer, but lag behind the Europeans in dynamics and sophistication IMO.Yes, Acura is FWD and AWD - which is a negative in the sport/luxury segment, but they have sweet shifting manuals and refined suspension tuning/dynamics.Lexus, OTOH has more RWD cars, but they tend to be front heavy (for a RWD) and a manual shifter is only available on the IS250.Ultimately, I think both Acura and Lexus fall well below BMW and Audi in terms of innovation, design, performance, and cache. None of which matters to the majority of consumers. We are enthusiasts, but most people shopping ELLPSs care about getting a 30GB hard drive and air conditioned seats for the lowest price. "
"m6user","June 2012"," ""m6...it sounds like you're looking for affirmation to buy or lease the RDX.""Not at all. Why would anybody come here to look for affirmation on buying a SUV? It's just that the conversation hit on a vehicle/brand that I'm interested in. Only Acura we ever owned was a used Integra I bought my son for graduation many years ago so I'm not a brand loyalist by any means.I don't lease but I am, in fact, looking hard at several different vehicles, both SUV and sedan, from different makers. Still can't decide if I want to get into an ELLPS or stay with a SUV. I do more than(anal could apply here) enough research on my own and have a pretty good handle on what's out there to be looking for affirmation from anybody. Just looking for good solid information....not biased opinions. "
"flightnurse","June 2012"," The dealership, when my partner and i were at the BMW dealer a couple of weeks back and test drove a 335d we were talking to him about the X3 and I asked about leases, he said the residual was 53%, higher then any other SUV in its class. "
"m6user","June 2012"," I understand. However, I just find it very one-sided to question my info that I got from a personal friend in the business and from personal experience of physically visiting dealerships and ask me for ""data"" to prove it. Then turn around and give me a number from a salesman and make it sound like a fact. What a crock. I guess it's all right for you to believe a BMW salesman but Acura salesman are just shysters. Ok, I get where you're coming from. "
"nyccarguy","June 2012"," I think the sales people (if you have a relationship with them outside of being a buyer) are a great way to gauge how well a car is selling (as M6User has pointed out).I also use my eye on what's on the road (as flightnurse does). To keep this on topic, I think I've seen maybe 4 F30 3ers on the road since it was introduced in February (because NOBODY buys RWD BMWs in the North East anymore).Another way is to check out the ads in your local paper. If an Acura dealer runs an ad that advertises lease deals (leader ad) for a Base TSX, a Base TL, a Base MDX, and then has a picture of the new RDX with a caption that says: 5 in stock w/ Tech pkg available for immediate delivery or order yours today, then you know you are probably going to be lucky with a $500 off sticker discount.Manufacturers can skew data results in their favor to make it look like they have a ""hot"" product. A unit's sales numbers might be way up from last year, but you don't know how many were produced. Acura knew its 1st gen RDX was due for replacement and not selling according to expectations, so they could have scaled production way down. "
"nyccarguy","June 2012"," BRAVO! Very well said my friend! "
"m6user","June 2012"," ""I also use my eye on what's on the road (as flightnurse does).""I think all of us that have a great deal of interest in automobiles do this. I have been known to ""stalk"" cars on expressways to get a good look at them from different angles. However, I've noticed over the years that unless I'm specifically looking for something, it could pass me by and and I wouldn't even notice it. That's why I won't offer an opinion on how well something is selling just because I haven't seen a bunch on the road, especially when it may not be a brand, style or model that I am particularly interested in. To your other point, you are talking about a % sales increase over prior year and what you say is true. However, the fact that a vehicle recently sold more than just about any other competitor vehicle in it's class doesn't have anything to do with ""last year"". But I also agree with flightnurse in that the RDX is a brand new redesign which has been significantly changed and has a lot of advertising tied to it. Sales will die down and then one can see how well it does going forward. But I stand by my earlier statement that ""dealers are selling the H out of them"" but for how long is the question. "
"nyccarguy","June 2012"," funny you say that about stalking cars. I'm always giving cool cars the thumbs up out of my sunroof when I'm driving the Prelude. Sometimes to other BMW drivers when I'm in my 328. You are right that if they are outselling every key competitor in its class that it has nothing to do with last year's sales numbers. I must have gotten a post or 2 confused. I agree that sales will die down with regards to the new RDX. "
"ctl","June 2012"," Considering the RDX competitors in the same category, most (X3/Q3/Q5/JX...) have pretty close sales numbers (plus a RX that sells 3 times more and being 3-4 years older), most being 5K+ more expensive... I will say either this statement is highly exaggerated, or the sales expectation was pretty low to begin with... We might say for the new generation, sales has improved and is much better than before.""dealers are selling the H out of them"" "
"m6user","June 2012"," Don't quite follow what you're getting at. The RDX, according to sales figures, have sold about 3 times more in May this year versus what the 2012 sold last year. Sales numbers are sales numbers and aren't exaggerated unless you have some inside information that the sales numbers are wrong. Remember last year you were dealing with a fairly unpopular(by the general public) RDX and sales could also have been curtailed by the sunami for a short time as the 2012 model, I believe, were all built in Japan. When you go from almost dead last in a category to almost 1st whatever term you care to use for the increase is correct. Let's not play sematics. "
"sweendogy","June 2012"," I think the term well said is over done on this board (look at last time) but- nope this was well said- look at the sale numbers - its all available for you on the www - same with resid value people- for those who ""have been in dealerships"" and talked to sales people as you test drive the new turbo d- it's all in sales numbers. Not What some Dealer is sayig about a brand he is selling- Amazing we have gotten to this- this was pointed out when people were talking about how great the new TL was- well it was almost 30% less great then the outgoing model- its all about sales.

"markcincinnati","June 2012"," Boy did you hit the nail on the head. Acura used to offer only SH-AWD (on the AWD cars) -- and as far as I know Acura's torque vectoring rear diff was on the market before my German fave, Audi, and their sport differential (which provides the same kind of advantage in handling as does SH-AWD, albeit in a RWD biased AWD auto.) Acura used to lead, or at least it appeared that they used to attempt to lead.What have they done, what have they done? Well, look on the lots of one of their dealers -- it is really difficult to find an SH-AWD vehicle (other than the MDX). They seem to not get that FWD doesn't cut it in the Premium class. They could've simply looked at Audi (in the US). I would assume most US customers don't even know that many of Audi's cars are sold as FWD models (elsewhere). In the US, however, virtually all Audis are AWD and they have made their name as pioneers of AWD. Now 40% of BMW sedans sold (in the US) are X-drive models; and even the mighty 7 series can be had with four driven wheels. Much the same can be said about Mercedes -- RWD heritage, AWD sales aplenty here in the US.Acura is cross shopped with Toyota? Of course, because the base products Acura offers are contented more like Toyota or Honda rather than Audi or BMW and with the Germans widespread use of 7 and 8 speed transmissions and Honda, er Acura continuing to bring out NEW cars (e.g., the ILX) with a 5 speed shifter is a dead giveaway.The ILX should have been SH-AWD (only!) and come with -- at bare minimum -- the very fine 6-speed as is found in the TL.The line should adopt the ""X"" suffix and it should mean ""we're all, AWD"" models. The new RDX comes out and it goes with the cheaper FWD biased AWD and eschews SH-AWD (and the thing can be had as an FWD -- who's dumb idea was that?)The new ILX comes out, FWD only, wimpy engine and when auto equipped has the long since forgotten (by the Germans and other Premium Japanese brands) 5-speed (what were they thinking?)My 2012 TL Advance w/SH-AWD should be the only way this car should be sold (in SH-AWD form, that is), and there should be a bunch more options to choose from and an ""S"" version to keep things interesting.I think, too, the new RLX will be stillborn -- who will pay for an RLX when they can have an Audi A6 3.0T Prestige for about the same price?Acura is the new Genesis, they just don't know it yet. I never would have imagined that Genesis cars and Equus autos could be sold at a Hyundai dealership, but here in Cincinnati the inventory of Genesis and Equus cars seems quite deep and I see them on the road virtually every day -- even the Equus.So, Acura should fold up its separate dealership network and move back in with mom and dad -- sell Acuras as higher priced Hondas, just like Hyundai sells Genesis cars as a separate line, but from the same dealership.And the reason that Lexus can ""get away"" with using some Toyotas as donor cars, is that the finished product -- from Lexus -- shares little with Toyota in its looks and interior.My TL has waaaaaaay too much Honda in it, is my point.Audis USED to have a whole bunch of VW in them -- over time Audi became a little less VW as every model year passed. Now, there certainly is ""something"" that reminds me of Audi in a new CC -- but there is virtually nothing in an Audi that reminds me of VW. Acuras are very nice, very smooth, apparently very high resale value cars and very much like ""Hondas who know somebody.""The Premium class will miss Acura when it finally fades away.I say all of the above not as a disatisfied Acura owner -- quite the contrary, the 2012 TL is very nice -- I'd give it an A-. It may be, however, that Acura has given up. It no longer wants to be the Japanese Audi. It never did want to be the Japanese BMW. I don't know what it wants to be anymore -- but it had better figure it out soon.For the record, I've never liked Lexus -- until this year, with their new more sporting, less sofa-like, cars (esp the GS). I am liking, more and more all the time, Infiniti, helped by the fact that my wife now has 30K miles on her 2011 FX35, and for a CUV, this thing is as impressive at 30,000 as it was at 1 (mile); and the M's are worth comparing to A6 and 5 series if you ask me.The only company that seems to be sailing the seas rudderless is Acura.More's the pity. :surprise: "
"kdshapiro","June 2012"," Love the g. The size is perfect. And yes, it is fast and rides like it is on rails. I'm unimpressed with the a4 and TL.Plus there are rumors of a 530 hp ipl. The next few years will be interesting. "
"sweendogy","June 2012"," Nice - and I remain impressed with my old g35x with 31k miles drives nice for a 5 year old with bald tires- i dont let my wife drive it, my maintence costs over the 5 years were about the same as a civic+ the 10 plus I paid less then a 335xi - performance + power at a cheaper price I think this car has been a home run.I like the Audi a4/s4 look- would love an s4, stick, quatro - they are a little front heavy and not cheap but it's a nice rig. The TL in current form and long name Should go away. Someone mentioned folding Acura into honda - makes since but I don't see it happening - and they just spent 1.5m on a Super Bowl commercial. "
"flightnurse","June 2012"," The G37 makes more HP then a BMW 335, but the BMW is quicker 0-60 and in the quarter miles. It appears that BMW laps Willow Springs ""Street"" track as well as ""race"" track quicker then a G37. So I guess this does make it a better deal... "
"flightnurse","June 2012"," I'm not too sure about the CTS being one size up on the 3 series, that CTS is very tight in the back seat as well as drivers seat....I rented one for a week and was no impressed with it at all.. "
"kdshapiro","June 2012"," I agree, and if you followed my posts over time you know my first love is BMW. However the g37 is a sweet package. According to goodcarbadcar.net, it's the second best japanese luxury seller after the rx.Also rented a CTS and agree with your comments. "
"sweendogy","June 2012"," BMW is the best for sure, but throwing dollars in the debate it's a lot closer. "
"dino001","June 2012"," I just checked Acura's website. So ILX w/6-speed manual (FWD) is 30 grand. This is demented - souped up Civic at price of fully loaded Accord (including Nav). Makes no sense whatsoever to me. TSX is basically superior car in every dimension, but I suspect it costs them too much. Too low sales to support bringing all-different chassis vs. having something run on volume seller. The only one that could make some sense is hybrid - at 34 grand it is positioned to compete with Lexus CT (which goes higher when you load it up). Definietely not ELLPS, but may find its niche. Who is running their marketing? I want a name.  "
"wireless","June 2012"," Marketing? How about their design department? Can't figure out who would actually purchase that ugly thing. "
"ivan_99","June 2012"," No joke...back in the day...my ""best man"" and I were having a conversation about cars. He's not a car guy at-all. Last time we talked he was ""sharing"" a car in the city he was living (pay per use type thing).Anyway...he mentioned how great the Pontiac Aztek was. How it was one of the vehicles he could own; it had and did everything.They'll probably still sell a few ILXs :shades: "
"flightnurse","June 2012"," ILX is suppose to bring the kids who grew with the luxury cars their parents owned. This is according to Car and Driver, however, if these kids are use to BMW, Audi and MB, why would they get a Japaneses car and not stick with a brand they are use to. As I stated before, why would anyone pay 33K for a ILX when they can get a CPO BMW 328i for the same price.. I think this is going to be a very hard sell for Acura... "
"flightnurse","June 2012"," So is the new ILX considered an ELLP ? Has the TXS now moved up from the entry level model? Can a car brand have two ELLP cars? "
"sweendogy","June 2012"," ""can a car brand have 2 .""According to edmunds - yes look to the right - they potentially can have 3 with this new rig. "
"graphicguy","June 2012"," Sorry Billy...been traveling for work....sorry it took awhile to respond. Never looked too close to,the back seat of the S4. Big trunk. The whole x4 series is bigger than what I was used to. I was astounded at its smoothness....smoothness of engine, trans (S-Tronic...which is a real gem of a trans) and the total operation of everything. In addition to excellent handling, the ride is really good. Add to that, it's a fast, fast car.I want someone in my family to buy one. Trying to talk my GF into buying one, as a matter of fact! "
"billyperksii","June 2012"," Actually, I went to the Audi dealer last Friday just to look at the A6 Premium Plus with either the 18 or 19 inch Sport Package and Cold Weather Package. What a surprise- non in stock-not even a single color combination. Anyway, the sales guy or should I say runner brought around a Premium Plus Non Sport for the test drive. I have to say that this car is fast for the weight its pulling. I was totally impressed with the handling because the test route was real twisty and sales guy kept insisting to push the car to its limit. Bottom line I like the car especially in the Dynamic(aka Sport) settings, very very enjoyable and the grunt was there at the bottom and at the top of tach. Here is what I dont like-the PRICE.There is absolutely no value in buying this car over TL-SHAWD. For what you get without starting to adding in the options is just outright absurd. In my opinion, this is a nice 45K car- Premiun Plus Trim, I would put the Prestige at 53K. Dont get me wrong now- I like the car but I think its overpriced.PS- Nice Dealership experience, the S4 I sat in, not pratical for me, way too tight in rear. "
"graphicguy","June 2012"," billy....that supercharged V6 in the Audi is really, really sweet. A6 is beautiful. I kind of compare those German marks like the A6, E350, BMW 535i to the TL SH AWD. That's what makes the Acura so appealing. It gives you 85% of those for about 20% less cost.I'm still smitten with the S4....and that's coming from a 335i owner.I think if you just add the driver selectable driving modes, with the torque vectoring to the options list, you come in just under $50K MSRP. Maybe buy it for $48K? That's for a Quattro, with 333HP, one of the sweetest sounding engines I've ever heard, running acceleration times near muscle car territory. "
"kdshapiro","June 2012"," Those other luxo sedans, are in a whole other league than these Ellpses. The 535 for example has a level of refinement not available int the g or TL. With tech not available in either. "
"dino001","June 2012"," Sometimes people cross-shop categories as the prices overlap (optioned 335 is well into 528). Also, some pople may be able to afford a 60K+ luxo sedan, but they don't mind saving 10-20 grand, if the price is right and get lower level. Graphic was basically making a point he'd rather keep the money and get TL, as those additional refinements are not worth the money to him. However, I agree that for purpose of this discussion, it is not really as relevant if 535 or A7 are good, bad or OK for the money. Their buying audience, while having some overlap, is not really the same. "
"graphicguy","June 2012"," dino....that's exactly my point. KD.....you get to a point of diminishing returns. Aside from the styling of the TL (which I happen to like), I think it would have been a category killer, if it had a prettier face.I'd be the first to admit that Acura (and Honda overall) has had a bit of an identity crisis the past few years. But, I think you could have said that about all the Japanese marks...even Toyota with their aspirations to be the biggest car company in the world didn't turn out so well for them. The tsunami only added fuel to the fire.Hondas and Acuras are really good cars. However, most are used to them being great cars. Frankly, if I were one to keep a car for 200K miles (which I'm definitely not), my first stop for shopping for one would be my local Honda or Acura store.It really is impressive what less than $40K (real world price) buys if you take a test drive of an Acura TL SH AWD. "
"billyperksii","June 2012"," Graph- My Acura dealer is houding me to take a test drive on the advance trim, not really intrested but if I find some time I probably will.My car only has 16K miles, he mentioned a buyout but I know some of the cost would be transferred to me. I am happy with the 09 TL TECH AWD,the car looks, drives and smell new.The S4 no longer sports the V8, its a v6 Turbo. "
"nyccarguy","June 2012"," The S4 is actually supercharged even though the badge says: ""3.0 T""I happen to like the TL SH-AWD styling & price for that matter. Electric power steering is a deal breaker for me though.Still loving my 328xi;) "
"dino001","June 2012"," TL may as well be their best offering in terms of the value. However, it looks that their immediate future offerings (ILX) are just taking turn for the worse. Seeing specs and pricing of ILX, it reminds me Saab 9-2X, which as we all know was dressed-up Subaru Impreza. The base version was identicanl to base Impreza and it had something like 5 grand premium, absolutely ridiculous. The Aero (dressed WRX) has a slightly smaller differential. They did offer some extras, like leather seat, better wheels, and (I think) sunroof, but at additional price. It was such a disaster that they ended up discounting the thing at levels BELOW Subaru street pricing. I know, ILX is much more separated from Civic, but the price premium over Civic is absolutely shocking. It is basically improved top of the line Civic at price of fully loaded Accord :sick: . What adds insult to injury, is that Civic itself is also acknowledged as underwhelming and underdelivering. I add my own experience with a rental Accord (base version) - a car I would put at bottom of my shopping list if I were in midsize market (obese floating barge with subpar interior). I see a seriously struggling company that is trying to live of its former glory (GM everybody?).If Acura keeps going that path, they will be thrown into oblivion, even if the cars themselves are actually good. They seem to be misreading the market (or in general), threir brand cache. It may be just me, but there is something in it, if the Civic will go for facelift just one year after introduction. It is not all lost - Subaru had terrible start with new WRX (this was a textbook example of losing your way), but they listened and fixed it right away. Hope Honda will, too. But Acura seems all but finished in sedan world, even with their good TL. "
"kdshapiro","June 2012"," If I could afford an M5, I would be driving one. At twice the price of my G is it twice the car? I guess it depends on what you value about the M5 vs the G (or TL or whatever).On another topic, the TL doesn't get any respect:- sales are lagging- doesn't seem to win many comparos- CRs favorite ellps is the G- etcDon't know why that is. "
"flightnurse","June 2012"," Graphic when it comes to buying the Mid Level Euro cars over the likes of the M37 or TL, it comes down to Emotion (how the car makes you feel) and how well the car responds. The TL (super duper AWD) is a nice car, it is comfortable and one can do a 800 mile day in it and not feel tired. But for me there is no emotion in the car, no soul. This is where the Germans excel there is a certain feel they have that no other car manufacture can reproduce. That is why people like myself, keep going back to a German car over anything else. Its like the saying the Harley guys have, ""If I have to explain it, then you wouldn't get it."" This is so true, and true about anything.. I love Ducati Motorcycles, I currently have 3 of them. I want another, but no room in the garage. I can buy a Honda CBR1000RR that is faster in a straight line then my Ducati 916, but the engine note, the way it builds power the handling and the looks all invoke a certain emotion that no other motorcycles has ever had.. I have ridden and raced MANY motorcycles but none have moved me like Ducati's do. BTW, if you want an experience of a outstanding engine note, drive a S5 or S6 with a V10 !!! "
"m6user","June 2012"," Electric Power Steering. One can tolerate in a CUV/SUV but for a sports sedan it has to be done really well. Acura's isn't done really well, just ok. When Mazda can do electric steering that is excellent there is no excuse for Acura not doing as well or better. "
"nyccarguy","June 2012"," m6user - I had the opposite in my garage. The TSX (""sporty sedan"") had electric power steering which I detested. My wife's Pilot (SUV) has hydraulic power steering which I most definitely prefer.The EPS is one of the main reasons I dumped my TSX after only 2 1/2 years. "
"graphicguy","June 2012"," kd....Gs are fine cars. Like KYFDX, I've tried to like them more, but just can't. And, I don't particularly know why.I read an article the other day (can't remember the source, though) stipulating that Honda is becoming arrogant.....that they believe they know better than their customers. That's a slipper slope, if true. My experiences with both Hondas and Acuras has been sterling. All models offer good value, and performance/tech/reliability/build quality....again, especially for what they cost.ILS....I haven't seen one yet. I doubt seriously I'll drive one in the foreseeable future.On the other hand, while I doubt I can talk her into it, the GF has agreed to go test drive an S4 tonight. She's been driving my 2nd car (Ford Fiesta) and seems perfectly happy in doing so. That said, she's got an Avalanche and a Subaru gathering dust in my driveway. Hmmmmm....I wonder if an Audi dealer would be interested in those?Never drove the V8 S4. From what I understand, the SC V6 is faster with better MPG, though. I do love the way it sounds, too. "
"billyperksii","June 2012"," ""Gs are fine cars. Like KYFDX, I've tried to like them more, but just can't. And, I don't particularly know why."" -Ditto. "
"kdshapiro","June 2012"," To me the G with the wood accents reminds me of a BMW drivers interior. The aluminum belongs in the convertible, not in the sedan.The TL is too busy on the inside, too big on the inside, too ugly on the outside and has a bigger turning radius than the competition.Having said that I consider the G and TL equals. Each one has something unique for the driver. "
"graphicguy","June 2012"," kd.....one of the advantages of the TL was the room on the inside. It had some really good seats, and I loved the way the steering wheel felt, too. That's what I liked about it. Trunk space was a little disappointing given the car's size, though. I think we're going to have to get used to buttons upon buttons on all cars. The ones in the TL took no time at all to master. Plus, most everything in the car could be accomplished either from the steering wheel or via voice command.Again, I like the G. Just not enough to spend my own money on one.Well....GF and I did a nice long test drive in the S4 last night. She liked it. I loved it. I didn't get the sense she liked it enough to pull the trigger on it, though. If she would get rid of both her vehicles ('04 Subaru and '05 Avalanche), she'd actually save a bit of money on insurance, and have no repairs (which are becoming more and more common on both vehicles recently). After I made the financial case, she's thinking about it.The one we drove, wicked looking black on black, had Nav, B&O stereo (very nice), 7-speed s-tronic (love that trans), and driver select driving customization with a torque vectoring rear.As good as my BMW handles and goes, the S4 does both better.MSRP was mid $50s. To add to the sticker shock, it was the first 2013 they had in stock, so no discounts. We can't have that.We'll see where this goes. "

And, she's been complaining about spending what seems like $200-$300/mo in repairs on both cars (which is why she's currently driving my Fiesta).So, trying to ""nudge"" her a little bit towards the S4.

"nyccarguy","June 2012"," Mazel-tov! It's GORGEOUS! We MUST hear how it drives! "
"graphicguy","June 2012"," Not sure what happend there with the pictures, but it looks like they were cut off. Probably a story more suited to the Sales Front Lines Forum, but that one's drifted a bit.So, how'd this come about?Well, GF had been driving my Fiesta. She has a couple of vehicles of her own....an Avalanche and a Subaru....both in good shape. When I had test driven the S4, I admit I loved the way it drove. It's as fast as my 335i (maybe a tenth or two quicker with the S4, 0-60, if that's important to know). But, as good as the ride/handling balance is on my 335i, it's better with the S4. Plus, I'd never sat in sport seats as good, or as comfortable as the ones in the S4. S-Tronic dual clutch transmission is a gem.Trunk is bigger, more room, etc in the S4 (vs my 335i coupe). So, GF had been talking about how she was planning to sell the Subaru as she wasn't using it much (because she was using my 2nd car, the Fiesta, most of the time). In addition, my son, who's been driving a car I game him, an '06 Honda Accord, with about 100K miles, was talking about buying something else.So, as we started plotting what, if anything we were going to do, I found a reason to test drive S4s at local dealers. We have two. One, about 30 minutes from me, the other about 45 mins-1 hour away. The closest one had one S4. Nice car....they acted like it was made of solid platinum. The other one further away, had one '12 and one '13. They were willing to deal, but really low balled the trade.Speaking of the trade, I decided to take my son's Accord back (actually, the title was still in my name), in trade for the Fiesta (less than a year old with about 5K miles on it). And, he gave me $5K, on a loan I made to him a year or so ago.With Father's Day upon us, we decided to spend the weekend, all together (GF, son, son's GF) in Chicago (about a 4.5-5 hour drive). Based on that, and the desire for the GF, and son's GF to go clothes shopping, and the men going car shopping. We drove the Accord, with the understanding as described above. Called a couple of dealerships around the Chicago area to see if they had any S4s. Not a lot of these cars out there. One dealership had 4 of them, but all the rest had 1-2. Again, these are scarce cars.Did a little homework before heading out to the big city. The Accord was worth between low $9s to high $9s on a trade. I came down right in the middle since the miles were a shade high.....$9,500 was the trade number. I had also done some contract work for VW of USA a few years back. My contact had told me at the time to let him know if I was ever in the market for a VW product, and he'd get my a supplier number for the discount they offer (6% off MSRP). I had that in my pocket.To be continued..... "
"kdshapiro","June 2012"," Lol, as nyccarguy said...Mazel tov. Lots of luck. "
"rayainsw","June 2012"," Very nice.Is that interior black with Alcantara inserts?- RayReady for The Rest of The Story... "
"graphicguy","June 2012"," Thanks all. Appreciate the good wishes.How does it drive? I'll compare it to the 335i. Well, that really isn't fair, given you can change the driving characteristics with ""Driver Select"" on the S4. But, I left it in ""Dynamic"" mode on the drive back from Chicago, which is the most agressive tuning.Steering is lighter than the BMW at low speeds, but tightens up nicely and linearly as the speeds increase. A smidgeon less feel of the road at low speeds (like when parking), spot on feel at speed. Given the rear wheel drive bias, and the torque vectoring, there wasn't a speed I was afraid to attack a corner. I'm sure there were limits, but only because of the tires (which have high limits to begin with).The sales person (who was a huge enthusiast) suggested I test the ""launch mode""....essentially, turning off trac control, rev the engine while foot is firmly on the brake, then release the brake. All 4 wheels hook up and WOW, I was literally launched, like a sling shot. Again, didn't have a stop watch. But, I would imagine if you're into stop light wars, unless you're staring at a 'vette, or a high buck exotic along side of you, you won't lose many of those.Flinging into a corner, the S-tronic shifts down with a blip to rev match and then powers out the other end as you exit. Impressive.As mentioned, it's more comfortable than my 335i, and has more room. Interior is gorgeous. Materials and build are all very high quality (even compared to my 335i, which isn't a slouch in that dept, at all).On a side note about tires, while we didn't buy the car we test drove, there was a difference between it, and the one we bought.......the tires. The test car had all season sports tires (Y rated). The one we eventually bought, had summer only tires. The GF, after driving both cars, decided she wanted the all seasons.The dealer agreed on the swap at no charge. Apparently, the all-seasons were a special order on a car in which the sale fell through. So, they were using it as a demo. But, it only had about 100 miles on it. I'm sure if you would track the car, you could tell the difference between the summer tires and the all-seasons. But, I couldn't.I mentioned previously, I got between 28-29 MPG on my 335i on all highway driving. There wasn't much in the way of break-in recommendations for the S4 in the manual (don't redline it or slam on the brakes in the first 500 miles). We cruised home to SW OH on a tankful, getting 26 MPG in the S4, on a green motor, driving anywhere from 70-80 MPH the entire way. That included some in-town, stop and go in the city, too. I'm thinking the S4 should match the 335i once the engine loosens up a bit.To be continued...... "

"driver100","June 2012"," VW product, and he'd get my a supplier number for the discount they offer (6% off MSRP). I had that in my pocket. To be continued..... Great story GG. I can't wait to hear the rest. By the way, that is a beautiful car. I hope you print your story on sales frontlines too.Briefly, we were going to trade in my wife's 2008 335Xi BMW for a 2013 328 or 335ix. We went on Saturday to test them. I checked the value of our trade in before I left and I got a range of $20,100 for dented one, and $24800 for top condition. Appraiser gave a value of $20000, said that is what they pay for them at the ""BMW auctions"".btw, the car is in mint condition, new tires, alignment, and 38k miles!We left, I told the salesman his price was good, he would take 5.5% off the new one. The difference was $42k for the 335 and $36k for a 328.My wife really wants a garage door opener on the mirror, and to get that on a 335 you need to take the navi-camera option which costs $4500. On a 328 you need 2 options, $1500+$4500. She doesn't need those.Before we left I said I would pay $40k difference, for the 335. He said it won't work.We left, I told the salesman, who is excellent, his price on the new one is good, but I am not too pleased with the allowance on the trade in, and I hinted the BMW auction sounds like an excuse to give you a low price.We checked out an Audi dealer on the way home, mainly because I was curious to see how much they would give me for our trade in. The salesman had a standard 2011 A4 coupe to try (or was it an A5?), and we loved it. Then we tried a 4 door 2013 Premium Plus automatic sedan, just to make sure the car felt right.Too be continued............. "
"driver100","June 2012"," There were lots of things we liked about the A4, more than the 335. For one, the clutch in the BMW doesn't engage until it is at the top 25% of the way. The Audi was smooth anywhere. Both front seats go amazingly high, for good vision. On top of that the dash and the hood are very low, giving excellent vision. The navi/radio/camera screen in the bmw just stands up on the dash, but the Audis is built in. We felt the Audi was basically more comfortable, not as jazzy, more European in it's style.So, we asked the salesman about pricing. Without wincing he said he would give us $24000 for the 335 trade in. He said, it is in mint condition, he will have no trouble selling it, he will get a minimum of $25000 for it, make a quick profit, and he will get us into Audis. The price difference was $27000 at that point This was sounding too good to be true because the BMWs were $36k and $42k. We asked if he discounted and he said he would take 3% off. I said take 4% off and it's a done deal. He agreed and we got the car for $25k difference! Truthfully, we both would have taken the Audi if the 328 and the Audi were on a lot and we wanted to choose one. I feel like I saved $11000 and actually came out with a car we both like more.It's also nice because the navi/camera/radio are all included, and THE CAR COMES WITH A GARAGE DOOR OPENER ON THE MIRROR as standard equipment.My wife says she is more excited with the Audi because the salesman said, Audi's main customer base is Europe and China. BMW is concentrating on North America so their cars are becoming more American. I think there is some truth in that, BMW is getting jazzier. You have to pay $1500 to get a Sportline and that is what every one wants. The Audi is all equipped ready to go.When we got home there was a message on the answering machine. The BMW salesman called to say he worked out a better price on the trade with the appraiser. I said, sorry, it's too late. I feel bad, he worked with us for a few months, and it was just a fluke that we decided to drop into the Audi dealer. "
"graphicguy","June 2012"," driver.....We're fortunate to be able to get cars that are so capable as either the BMW or the Audi. These are cars that are really at the very pinnacle of the lux/sports car round up. From this point, cars get bigger, heavier, thirstier, etc. Driving a 5 series, or even an E350, you can feel the performance penalties from their smaller siblings. Now, if that's what you like and want, perfect. I think most on this board would rather have a faster, more nimble car than what those represent, however.Saw an A7 on the showroom. Slick looking car. Even the A6 is a pretty car...inside and out. Maybe an S6 is something I'd be interested in at some point. Not right now though.OK.....where were we.Before the GF, my son and I headed out to Chicago, my son and I shopped his (my) Accord at a couple of dealers, including one of the local Audi dealers. We've all heard the dealers, and their rationale for low balling a trade (wrong color, wrong equipment, soft market for the car, need to wholesale it, etc). Bottom line, the Accord couldn't be more smack dab in the heart of the plate when it comes to used car desirability. They're reliable, good on gas (4 cyl, like mine), handle well, built well, will last 200K+ miles if reasonable care is taken. So, none of those ""reasons"" for low-balling really resonated with me. And, this particular one had never seen a paint booth or a body shop. Yes, there are some chips and a couple of dings here and there, but you would have to look hard to find them. It had good rubber, clean interior, everything worked the way it should, documented oil changes every 5K miles. All routine maintenance up to date.Locally, I was offered $7.5-$8K....or, about $2,000-$2,500 from what I had researched as the car's trade value was. My opinion, this would retail for $13K-$15K all day long. Let's say some lot was in a hurry to sell it....$12K would get it gone in a few days, not weeks. $9,500 was the right number on a trade.GF and I spent a good amount of time talking about the Audi. S4s aren't cheap. She thought about leasing. But, anyone who knows me on these boards, knows I don't like leasing. So, I talked her out of it. Without some hefty money up front, it wasn't going to be doable for her. We figured the payment she would be comfortable with. We figured what it would take. That's how we launched the plan we made.It took some car finagling on my part. And, my name is on the note, since I'm the one who put the downpayment up. She still has to sell an 8 year old Subaru and give me the proceeds. And, if anything were to happen between she and I (we've been together for many years, so no need to go there....just covering all bases), the car reverts to me since I put most of the upfront money on it. But, she's making payments.As mentioned, the closest Audi dealer wanted MSRP on the only S4 they had in stock. They would not honor the Supplier Discount certificate. That dealer also offered the lowest trade value. Not doing business there (KYFDX....this is the dealership in Montgomery). The other dealership, further away, honored the supplier discount, but still came in $2,000 shy of my number on the trade.GF contacted my son, knowing I love Chicago in the Summer, and planned to take me there for my birthday (which was last week). That's how the plan sprang to life to research Chicago dealers for the S4.She found a dealer who had the most stock and told them what we were looking to do....with the trade and the supplier certificate. As a back-up, there were two other dealers who had at least 1 S4 in stock. In short, she contacted all of them. Told them what we were trying to do, with the qualifier that we were driving 5 hours, were going to have to spend the night, and had to pay for gas/meals and lodging. If we couldn't make a deal, they would have to pay $250 for our gas and lodging. Smart girl....that's one of the (many) reasons I love her. Only one dealership agreed to the terms in writing (which she insisted on) via an email....the one with 4 S4s in stock. They wanted the VIN for the Accord, and an agreement from us that if the Honda were substantially different than what we described, the deal was off.She told me of her agreement. We decided that if anything about the deal changed, we'd be prepared to walk away, and drive home in the Accord. My son didn't have much choice. He had to agree to whatever we agreed to if things didn't work out.You already know how this turned out since I've posted pics of the car. But, there's a little more to the story.To be continued...... "

He said he wants to sell the Maserati (about 5 months old) because of a huge blind spot on the quarte panels. He asked me how much damage I estimated it would cost to fix.

"graphicguy","June 2012"," Thanks guys....Stickguy....you're right. It's a not a direct line to get to where we ended up.So, we left on Friday after work....GF, son and me, on our way to Chicago. Grabbed dinner once we arrived (Weber Grill.....highly recommended). Early Saturday, GF heads for the Miracle Mile. My son and I head to the Audi dealership.We get there as soon as they open, 9:00 a.m. Two S4s are sitting in front, one black, and one white, all cleaned up. The GF didn't care which one, but liked the black one, and the white one, based on pics the sales person sent her.Salesperson knew from our OH tags who we were, and immediately approached, offered coffee and doughnuts. ""Yes"" to the coffee. ""No"" to the doughnuts (son helped himself though). I immediately liked the black over the white one. Salesman gets the key, gives it to us for a test drive, as well as us giving the Accord keys to him for inspection.We take a 30 minute test drive. Pull back to the dealership. Salesman asks us to meet the General Manager. We shake hands. He's a nice guy. Explains that he hates giving trade quotes without seeing the trade. He points out a couple of small parking dings and paint chips on the Honda.Knowing where this is going, I ask....""so, you think the $9,500 offer you made is one you can't support?"". A little hesitation, but in essence, that's what he was saying.He wanted to counter. I really didn't care and got up. Asked him if he was going to keep his agreement to at least cover our gas and lodging. He seemed surprised at the suddeness that this deal came to such an abrupt halt.He said....""I don't want this to be adversarial. Didn't you come to buy a car?""""I did........drove 5 hours to buy one, as a matter of fact. Not willing to waste any more time"".The GM asked the sales person to get us some sodas. ""Can I see your Supplier Certificate?"" ""Sure, but I'm stuck on the $9,500 for the trade"".He gave a cursory glance at the Supplier Certificate.""We want you as a customer, no matter how far away you live. We're not going to dicker with you over a few hundred dollars. We appreciate you coming all this way to do business with us. Congratulations on your new car.""30 minutes later, finished with F&I, I was in the delivery area with the sales person going over the features.

My wife loves European cars much more than any others...I prefer them, but I could get used to a Cadillac or a Mustang.The Audi salesman said something that my wife was very impressed with. He said BMW and Mercedes have their biggest markets in the U.S. so their cars are being made to appeal to that market the most. Audi's biggest market is Europe and then China. He said Audi for him, is holding onto it's European roots. I really think what he said is true. When we tested the new 335 it is getting more American in ride quality and in the jazzy interior layout. The Audi has more of a basic Euro driving feel, and the interior is tastefully less jazzed up.In our case, we like the Audi better, and it was $11000 less than a 328, and $15000 less than a 335 (if you consider $4000 more for the trade in)which we would have to have bought because her current car is a 335 and it would be difficult to go for the smaller engine after having a 335.

Wish I could remember who did the review. It was a professional review, however.It's clear where all the money is going for transmission development...auto-manuals, dual clutch, more gears (Audi's manual is a 6 speed, S-Tronic is a 7 speed).

"nyccarguy","June 2012"," Sweendogy - I give you a lot of credit for attending various driving schools. I also agree with you that if more people (not the guys here on the board), drove vehicles with manual transmissions that they'd pay more attention to their everyday driving habits. I used to heavily criticize many things on these boards many moons ago (I think I signed on in '99) from AWD to Automatic Transmissions. Automatics WERE terrible. My 1st car was a 1992 Chevrolet Beretta GT w/ a 3 speed automatic (garbage), my 2nd car was a 1998 Ford Explorer Sport with a 5 speed automatic that shifted slow & violently. I LOVE my 2001 Honda Prelude Type SH equipped with a slick shifting, 5 speed manual transmission. I DID NOT appreciate the bill I got to replace the clutch, friction plate, & throw out bearing at only 52,000 miles. My 328xi is an automatic w/ AWD. It's our 2nd BMW with AT & AWD (1st was my wife's 2007 X3). Manuals have been an $800 or so option for a number of years on the Corvette. Yes they are somewhat of a compromise, but that margin is getting slimmer & slimmer every year.I'd like to teach my children (5.5, 3, & 7 months) to drive stick and have their 1st car equipped with a manual transmission.Speaking of ""driver skills,"" I put the brakes to the test on my BMW this morning. About 3/4 mile away from my house, I'm on a straight section of a curvy road. I see a TSX that took the corners so badly he was heading straight towards me. I jumped on the brake pedal (there was nowhere to go) and those BMW clamped down & stopped IMMEDIATELY! This would have not been an offset front end collision, this would have been a straight head on collision. If I had left 1 second earlier, not come to a full & complete stop @ the stop sign by my house... WOW! I think at the very least Id have been car shopping again or at the worst put BMW's crash worthiness to the test. Makes you think... WHAT ON GOD'S GREEN EARTH WAS THIS GUY DOING IN MY FREAKIN LANE? "
"kdshapiro","June 2012"," One of the things about crash avoidance, is the ability for the car to react as fast as you do. When you make the chassis faster than the speedometer, that can happen. "
"graphicguy","June 2012"," nyc....Glad to hear you're OK. BMW's brakes are excellent, as you found out.When my son turned 15, I taught him to drive on a manual transmission, not an automatic. I still had my track Mustang at the time and was irregularly taking it to the local track. And, I took him to Mid-Ohio for autox (myself and a friend set up and drove a Toyota FX16 there).Did any of it make him a better driver? I don't know. Those first couple of years, he actually had more tickets and accidents than I did at the same time in my driving career.And, when he got the chance, he went for an automatic vs a manual transmission car.The benefit of manual trans, if there is one, has faded over the years. First, the manual trans was used because they offered better fuel economy. That's simply not true today (with rare exceptions).As many of us can testify here (including yourself), today's automatics are miles away from where they used to be.On the track, or the highway, there's no way I can shift as quickly as the S-Tronic can. I hit the paddle shifters and the shift is firm and immediate.The auto/manual trans in your BMW, it will be in the right gear, at the right time, and do it quicker than you can.That offers more control over the car, not less.The higher up the performance and price ladder you go, the fewer and fewer manual transmissions you'll see. As was pointed out before, even Ferraris and Lambos are now sporting ""manumatics"". Most would agree that those are at the top of the heap when it comes to personal performance cars.Maybe somebody can make another thread to talk about manual transmissions, as in here, this has become derailed. kd....couldn't agree with you more.

"gogiboy","June 2012"," GG--This little dust-up reminds me of a debate that descended into a verbal assault over on Edmunds ""Inside Line"". As often happens someone gets critical--even nonsensical over some perceived problem with a technology or car, in this case the new Scion/Subie joint venture.Anyway, this anti-Scion poster argued vehemently (one could almost imagine the spittle on his computer screen) that no car could be called a sports car with only 200 HP as if that as the only measure of a sports car could be distilled into one number divorced from all other driving characteristics. No amount of argument from others would sway him from his position. I liked it when another poster pointed out that by that narrow definition no Austin Healey, MG, Triumph, Fiat, etc--all mid-60s icons of sportiness-- could be classified as a sports car.Alas, neither would my 92 MR2 with only 140 HP, but it always feels like a sports car to me (and GG I whisper this: it has a manual)Gogiboy "

"stickguy","June 2012"," interesting question about HP.

I know it had a V8, but no clue how much HP it had than (or ever!).So of cars that I actually plated and drove, probably just those 2. Had a 1998 Maxima SE, but that only had 190 I think.

"graphicguy","June 2012"," Hey Gogi....haven't seen you around in awhile. Where have you been? Don't be a stranger.I should know better than to be drawn into those types of pretentious/contentious posts. My son really likes the Subie version of that BRZ. I told him he probably has another 4-5 years on his newly acquired Fiesta (which he really likes, with its version of a dual clutch trans automatic) before he should look at one. Who knows what will be available by then.

"gogiboy","June 2012"," GG--I'm still hanging around--not too much posting. I guess I'm spending too much time in the studio and with my dogs.I see where the Subie/Scion Twins were #1 and #2 for shortest time on dealer lots for May (4 days and 5 days respectively), which makes sense given their recent release.I mentioned on Sales Stories that I looked at a Scion frs on the lot of my local dealership. It's a good looking car from the outside, but the interior looks rather cheap to me. I think it's in keeping with the ""driver's car"" philosophy being espoused by Toyota (and it's probably keeping the cost down). The one on the local lot lasted close to three weeks before it sold. I haven't seen it around town yet although it might have been purchased by someone from OKC or Tulsa since they are only 60 miles away and the pricing is fixed with Scion so buyer's will pay the same anywhere. Actually, I say that and I know my local dealership doesn't play any mark-up games so maybe it's a better deal if some of the dealers are charging a surcharge for these high-demand cars.By the way congrats on the Audi. My brother did a similar move last winter, but reversed the brands. They own an Audi Allroad and he just added a new BMW X-3 to their stable. His wife drives the Allroad and he drives the X-3. Interestingly, he went from a BMW 3 series to a Honda Element to the X-3, which strikes me as a bit auto schizophrenic.Gogiboy "

"sweendogy","July 2012"," Don't understand why you can't have multiple sedans in a family setting? Why not have the partner get the coupe or convert? I will say the ""downgrade?"" to the NSx could not be a better more exotic pick. Make sure you get the manual because I think the auto was slower and had less hp(maybe its just my bias towards stick, but I think this may be true). Love the NSx - the end of it coincidently ended Acura as a cheap lux sport brand it was previously known- now its just Hondas Buick line. Better pick one quick before Jerry stienfield and jay Leno come swoop one up. "
"flightnurse","July 2012"," Being a armchair quarterback is easy to do, however, when you don't have all the facts one ends of washing egg off ones face. If it was easy as you say it would be done. We have a 3 car garage, one bay is taken up by my oldest hobby (love), motorcycles, I have some classic's, old school and new school bikes (6 total). So this leaves two bay open, before selling the 328, that was sitting outside, while the 330 was in the garage, the other bay belongs to what Rick drives. I travel for work, I'm on the road more then I am home, so to have multi sedans was not a good use of space. The 328 had 4500 miles on it (two trips to San Diego in it) and was bought back in Oct-2011, when I was home and the weather was good (which was most of the time) I would ride one of the bikes. So with the sale of both BMW's this will give me enough cash to buy the NSX that I want, the extra money would go to Rick and whatever he wants. We are all happy and the driveway is not cluttered with cars. "

"graphicguy","July 2012"," Took my 335i in for its first oil change on Monday. They gave me a loaner car to use, but couldn't understand why since it shouldn't take very long to just change the oil and check a few things.But, it was a '12 335i sedan, the new F30 update. I had already driven the 328i 4 cyl version. While there have been a lot of accolades about it, I still preferred the former 6 cyl 328i. Plus, there were other things I really didn't care for on the '12s.....the ""start/stop feature"", which really felt half backed in the 3, and certainly not befitting such a car.I don't know the ""theme"" of the interior on the loaner, but the interior was black with red accents. Very nice. The interior is a nice upgrade from mine.Mine feels a tad quicker, but mine has the performance pack. I really couldn't feel much difference between the 8-speed auto in the '12 vs my 6 speed.All-in-all, not an upgrade worth spending money on compared to mine. But, as BMW is want to do, somewhere down the line they'll make some incremental changes that may catch my fancy. They aren't there right now, though.Still, nice update. I wasn't able to get back to the dealer until later in the day. My sales person happened to be in service when I got there to pick up my freshly oiled, washed and dried car. We chatted a bit.""What do you think of the new one""?""Nice....but not enough of a difference maker to me.""""They're hard to come by....335i, plus we haven't even seen an xDrive version yet. I'm steering people to order a '13 since the '12s were slow to roll out.""""Interesting...I'd think BMW would love to put a bunch of them in the dealers just to get a big jump on the new model roll out.""So, I guess if you're in the market for a new one, '13s are the way to go, and you'll have to order one.

I get manuals for one reason only - it is throttle-engine-wheels-road connection that no hydrokinetic (torque converter) transmission can replicate.

Now a side note, the service cost of the CVT is 300% more then the traditional automatic transmission, just to get the fluid changed in the CVT on the Rogue was $250, this includes the filter.

"graphicguy","July 2012"," kyfdx.....I'm really quite surprised that BMW found the ""start-stop"" feature to be ready for prime time. As you say, if it can be turned off, that alleviates some of the negativeness I was left with. But, if it's default mode, and you have to turn it off every time, I'd still consider that a deal breaker.Not sure how it's programmed (or even if it can be programmed), but at redlights, the engine shuts down after 5 seconds or so. In addition, so does the A/C compressor, or so it felt like, because there was definitely a drop in the cooling effect at red lights.Then, either after a couple of minutes of being shut down, or the lift off from the brake pedal, the motor starts back up again, with a harsh shudder that's felt in the cabin. It's pretty abrupt, too.If GM would have had such a poor performing feature in their cars, they would have been crucified in the trade rags. It's really surprising to me that BMW brought such a half baked and poor performing feature like start/stop to market in their bread and butter car.They'll have to do something.....a computer reflash, maybe a way to permanently switch the feature off.

I'm sure there is a company that will be able to reflash the computer to disable this feature soon.When BMW brings over their oil burner 3 series this will help with their CAFE # so BMW can do without the start-stop BS...NSX update, no news.... "
"m6user","July 2012"," The start-stop is not just for fuel economy. It's also an anti-polution control. Some countries in Europe have laws against idling too long. It wouldn't be BS if they could get it right......meaning invisible. "
"flightnurse","July 2012"," Now this might be true in Europe, however, that is not the case here in the US, the start-stop feature is all about the increasing the CAFE #.... I have to wonder how much does it increase them by?  "

"m6user","July 2012"," I thought I read somewhere where (in some cars with start-stop, don't know if BMWs or not) if the temp rises inside the car by X degrees the motor will start or the A/C will run off the battery for a short period to maintain comfort. "
"graphicguy","July 2012"," What's your take on the electric power steering?NYC...the steering was.....hmmmm....best I can say is ""different"". I really only spent maybe 45 minutes in the car (drove from the dealer to office, office to home, home to dealer). Did I like it as well as the steering in my 335i? Nope!But, the '12 328i is weighted differently, too. It doesn't feel linear in response, like the E90 or the S4 does. Those are more predictable where the E90 feels...not quite sure.....""artificial"" I guess would be the best way I could describe it.If the new 3's A/C runs off the battery if it gets too hot when stopped, I could see a problem where you're stuck by a long train, or in a big traffic jam where that would deplete your battery. So, now your steaming hot, and the car won't restart because the battery was depleted by the A/C.Usually, car companies think things through more thoroughly than BMW has thought this ""start-stop"" feature through. I still believe they are going to have to do some sort of update that allows you to turn the feature off permanently. Otherwise, their service depts are going to be flooded with complaints. "

"dino001","July 2012"," That's right. I think Graphic is simply projecting what his fears of what if it programmed incorrectly, rather than actual performance. I'm sure it is programmed to use stop/start only if rest of the systems is sound, not unconditionally at every stop. All it needs is a battery charge sensor programmed to into the feature. "
"graphicguy","July 2012"," dino....m6...I would hope that BMW has some sort of programming done on the new 3 that allows the car to start if the battery gets below a certain depletion level.However, given the harshness of the start/stop feature, it feels like it's half baked to begin with. So, I'm not really sure.In either case, now you're stuck with a car that's stuck in traffic or at a railroad crossing that shudders throughout the car every few minutes when it re-starts.

Apparently, Nissan has seen the success of the BRZ and decided that's the direction they were going.The problem, where does that leave the G? They already tried to move it down in the food chain with a smaller motor, and failed at it. They can't move it up, as the M resides there (which has also been pretty dismal). Maybe Infiniti becomes strictly an SUV marketer? They've had success there. "

"graphicguy","July 2012"," cdn.....couldn't agree more. That ""start/stop"" feature is probably minuscule in fuel/emissions savings. Start up is when the most emissions are emitted.

They didn't care about the run flat tires, or no more oil dipsticks (in fairness, they aren't the only ones).

They have WiFi which makes a 5 hour flight go by very quickly and I can get home work done too. Multi tasking is a must when one works full time (on the road) and going to school full time.Now back to cars, I had a 2012 Camry SE in Charlotte NC ( had to drive to High Point NC) the drive is roughly 2 hours (all depending on traffic.) so I had good butt time in this car. It had the enTune, very nice system, being that it was a rental there was limited access to what one can do, but over all was impressed with it. I'm anticipating the new Nissan Altima to hit the car rental lots soon, very promising to take over the top spot from the Camry.

Of course that was fixed in the second generation. One has to wonder why didn't BMW figure that out, they do hot weather testing here in Arizona as well as Death Valley, Ca and Africa.

"fedlawman","July 2012"," Renting a Mondeo diesel with 6MT. Nice car - the new design looks really nice in person (like an Aston Martin married a Kia Optima), but man it is slow. "
"flightnurse","July 2012"," Hey Fed, which diesel engine does it have?On my flight yesterday from Raleigh-Durham to Detroit the guy sitting next to me was a Ford Engineer who is working on the New Fusion, he is waiting for the green light to bring over a diesel power fusion. He would like to see the 2.2l 200hp diesel come over, however, he thinks ford will choose the the 2l 160hp engine. Either way it will be good to see Ford give VW a run in the family sedan with a diesel. He was telling me all about the car, I haven't spoken to a car engineer that was so excited about a new product before. But the Mondeo is a 5 door if I'm not mistaken, right? So what are your thoughts on the overall car? "
"fedlawman","July 2012"," I don't know which diesel it is. The engine cover says Ford Duratorq, FWIW - no other info to be found in the car. Yes, it's a 5 door.There is some torque to be had between about 1800 and 3500 RPM, but nowhere else. Redline is 4500. If I had to put numbers on the car, my seat of the pants guess would be 0-60 in maybe 11 or 12 secs.Steering is light with little feedback, but the car tracks beautifully. Ride is Euro firm and compliant - much better than the current Fusion. Body roll and rebound are very tightly controlled. Clutch is light and shifter is effortless with short throws with a smidge of cable notchiness, but not in a bad way.The cabin is laid out very well with high quality materials and the cabin is very quiet on the highway - and I do mean quiet. The ride is serene with very little wind or road noise, and a very rigid chassis with zero flex. Squeaks and rattles are non-existent.I haven't pushed the car so I can't comment on sporting capabilities, but as a touring car, it is outstanding. "
"alltorque","July 2012"," I don't know which diesel it is.Knowing how rental companies operate here in Europe it's probably the 1.8 TDCi engine rated at either 100bhp or 125bhp. Could be the 2.0 at 115bhp but unlikely to be anything more exotic. 0-60 for that bunch is, indeed, in the 11 to 12 seconds bracket.The other engines on offer in our Mondeo are 2.0 TDCi's with either 140 or 175bhp; the latter showing circa 8.4secs for 0-60. However, 0-60 dashes are not what diesels are about, really. Economy, stressless driving, good mid-range punch, (40-70 is usually pretty fair). The Mondeo is rated highly here in Europe and seen as a good, and cheaper, BMW 3 series competitor without the sporting pretentitions, (which in the case of the cooking-end of the 3 series really are pretentions). Glad you're enjoying it.  "
"fedlawman","July 2012"," You're right, I am noticing that 0-60 really isn't important here because of the way the roads are designed here - and all the small towns one passes through. The registration paper I found says 1560 cc - don't know if it's accurate though. Yes, midrange pull isn't bad, and it got above 160 kph with little fuss. My only real complaint is the throttle response, which is very lethargic. It's as though the flywheel weighs 40 lbs. I'm sure it's programmed into the fly-by-wire, but it makes downshifting more difficult and heel-and-toe immpossible. It's the same effect I notice on many new cars I've driven. Other than that, a very nice car. "
"sweendogy","July 2012"," The new caddy that zigs. Hosts it's time to update the list of cars again.""http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2013-cadillac-ats-first-drive-review "
"billyperksii","July 2012"," I dont see any breakthrough here- same old Caddy with two poor choice of motors. Why even bother with the 3.6- the CTS has it. "
"sweendogy","July 2012"," Same old caddy? Did you read the article? It may be the same engine - but correct me if I'm wrong most cars here have engines recycled within a line- even the beloved Tl and BMW. "
"flightnurse","July 2012"," Bill, Caddy thinks the ATS is a 3series fighter, the interior room is smaller then the current 3 Series, the standard engine in the ATS only makes 202hp, BMW 240hp.This is what Caddy says about the ATS "" 2.0L Turbo direct-injected four-cylinder 272HP engine providing a 0-60 time of 5.7 seconds and 32 MPG highway.2 A 6-speed automatic transmission is standard""OK the standard 2L turbo in the BMW only makes 240hp, but is faster 0-60 and getting better highway mileage, and comes with a 8 speed auto... Once again the caddy falls short, the 3.6l 0-60 is about the same as the turbo 4 in the BMW.... So the turbo 6 in the BMW is even faster and gets about the same mileage as the turbo 4 Caddy.. Not too sure I would be boasting these numbers since caddy says that ATS can hold itself up against the 3 series...I laugh that Caddy thinks the ATS is the same size as the 3 series but it is not, the interior volume is less, and also caddy thinks the CTS competes with the 5 series... Hardly. BTW, you can now build a ATS... Now I wonder how the ATS hold up against the G25 since that is what it should be crossed shopped to. "
"billyperksii","July 2012"," No you are not wrong- put G on the list too.My point is, just another boring entry level car to add to the ever increasing list. "
"stickguy","July 2012"," if you are in the 5s 0-60, that is fast by any measure. so haggling over .1-.2 seconds seems petty, and even statistically insignificant. and what is the MPG difference, 1 mpg?size wise, it has almost the identical footprint I thought? and some cars feel more or less roomy than the CG rating, depending on how they are laid out.at least they offer the V6, most likely for the customers that just won't do a 4 cyl.anyway, as this thread proves, there is a lot of personal opinion involved with this class of car, but from seeing one in person (at the auto show) and reading about them, it sounds like it very much is a strong competitor (probably with a little more American flavor), and that some people will like it and some won't.but I don't think you can use those few #s on paper to say it is a loser entry. "
"m6user","July 2012"," Exactly. Gee, the Cad has more 30 more HP, a little more torque and weighs less than the 3(very little) so those are huge pluses on it's side, right? I don't think so. These very small differences don't mean beans....whichever side has the plus or minus. Love it when a brand new car comes out that nobody has driven or even sat in most cases and ""decide"" that a few small stats automatically make it a loser. Pretty close minded don't you think?  "
"billyperksii","July 2012"," I did not say the car is a loser- I just said BORING, nothing new under the sun, just another participant in this segment.The manufacturers need to take this segment to another level because the non-premium brands are offering the same features for far less than what the so call premium brands are offering.Case in point- my dealer wants me to trade up to the advance trim TL, his convincing points are, cooled seats, blind spot indicator, crisper NAV graphics and 6 speed auto-I told him the KIA Optima offers that for thousand less.With all that said, my pride hinders me from purchasing a KIA.I will just have to wait until 2014 to see what the next generation TL has to offer. "
"m6user","July 2012"," If you can't tell the differnece in quality by just sitting in a TL versus sitting in a Kia, then maybe you should be driving a Kia cause you would be satisfied with the cheap leather and the trinkets. The steering and suspension may suck on the Kia but gotta love that heated steering wheel. I miss that soooo much on my car.......NOT.I'm not really a fan of Cadillac or GM for that matter, but what is so boring about the new ATS? It looks like a baby CTS and I've never heard the CTS described as boring. A lot of other things, but not boring. "
"sweendogy","July 2012"," Good points- problem with alot of the anti caddy (or anything non BMW or Audi) posters its all about the Germans - they continue to boast about the great BMW any always bash with out any real substance behind it. The 1 or 2 mpg difference, or the size - come on guys it comes down to pricing -value should be considered - that's why consumer reports continues to rank the g (it's now in its 6th year as the number one car in the class). I have not priced this new caddy out but if it's priced right it should be considered. I love the boring comments - look at the cars on the right - the tsx is an accord, hello "
"billyperksii","July 2012"," Not literally boring- just same old same old. "
"m6user","July 2012"," The way I look at these cars is that they all have their attributes which attract certain types of buyers(driving enthusiusts if you must). The Germans have great styling that stands the test of time and great suspensions. I would have added steering but not so much anymore. Japanese have great engines, cheaper TCO and nice bells and whistles. The Americans have good cars in this field and getting much better IMO and are kind of a combo of the Germans/Japanese. Regardless of what Hyundai/Kia is doing lately they don't really particpate that well in this field given their crappy suspensions, steering, and handling in general and cheaper(but flashy) ingredients. To some handling the curvies is more imporant than straight line power and to others the opposite and then some like a little of both. None are wrong and none are absolutely right! I know I forgot Volvo but are they Swedish or Chinese?...I'm not sure now. I probably missed something else too. Anyway, they all have things that are more important to the individual so to put one down because it doesn't fit into one's personal ""vision"" of a great ELLPS is silly. "
"graphicguy","July 2012"," Yeah....Cadillac has been hyping this car for awhile. The biggest issue with them, they've been touting their ""BMW"" killers for awhile now. Until very recently, they were anything but.Maybe this car changes that perception, maybe not.I've driven the CTS Coupe. It's a nice effort. Would I trade my BMW for it? Nope! I don't know what it is, Cadillac has the sort of ""feel"" that doesn't impress me (actually, all GMs have that ""feel""). If the CTS didn't WOW me away from the BMW, I doubt the ATS will, either.That doesn't make it a bad car. I think it may sell well. But, those sales will go to people who wouldn't look at a BMW/Audi/Mercedes to begin with. The ATS will most likely capture the Buick owner (or maybe the Chevy person). Maybe that's exactly what GM wants. Their gateway car (Chevy) customers staying in the family, moving up (Buick) and finally to their top cars....Cadillacs. "
"flightnurse","July 2012"," M6, Caddy has building the hype for this car for a while, saying that the ATS will be able to overtake the 3 series and its build in the US. The only engine that was ever talked about was the turbo 4 and how much more power it makes over the BMW as well as price. Now come to find out there are 3 engines, and the starting price is less then the BMW, however, if you want the Turbo 4 the starting price is slight less then the base 3, the performance is less then the BMW, and the Caddy has a 6 speed auto and the BMW has an 8 speed auto, you can only get a manuel in the turbo 4 in the caddy all others is an auto (if memory serves me, this is a deal breaker for many of you.)Stick, the 335 is more then .5 sec quicker then the V6 ATS, and the ATS has more power. Also caddy hasn't released the 1/4 times yet either, I'm suspecting that the BMW's will be faster there too.I was hoping for more from the ATS, since with all it's hype that GM has been generating, but the performance numbers so far haven't been all that good for the kind of HP the car is making... "
"flightnurse","July 2012"," Graphic all the hype has been taking owners away from BMW, that wont happy. I have rented a couple of CTS sedans and the interior space feels cramped to me, more so then a 3 series, so not too sure how the ATS is going to fare there. If the bigger brother is feels smaller, then the smaller ATS will be smaller.. "
"flightnurse","July 2012"," M6, I am far from an Anti Caddy person, in fact In the last month I have been trying to sway my partner to go look at the Buick LaCrosse, so far that hasn't been easy to do, and he is from Detroit. For the past 4 months I have waited for the ATS to be released and with more information, however, the hype I think was greater then what GM could product the first time out. Look how long it took caddy to get the CTS where it is today? I like the CTS, but not too sure how GM can say that the CTS is in the same league as an A6, 5 series or E class.... On paper it does, but the translation from paper to product didn't happen very well. I think the same thing is going to happen with the ATS. Regarding Kia and Hyundai the current crop of high end luxury cars is just the start, I bet they will get their cars dialed in faster then GM will. "
"m6user","July 2012"," I seem to recall a number of posters on this thread infering that 0-60 times weren't that important when a certain someone was relating how the G37 is so much faster 0-60 than the 3. Oh well, I guess when it fits one's argument it does matter. I could care less about the ATS and also don't care if a car is stick or auto, but I still say it's sad that so called auto enthusiusts are so close minded when a new car comes out and trash it before it's even been thoroughly tested or doesn't fit a particular mold. It's sad really. "
"sweendogy","July 2012"," M6 the name is sweendogy- Not certain someone. The elephant in the room- the guy who makes this channel work by posting relevant topics, thus causing discussion. (see above) Sure people don't agree with me, but I don't make up ""points"" - before I post I do homework. And I agree the german bias argument is old, sad, and it's rude. They make great cars but so do others - plus German cars come at a sizable premium. Remember this is Ellps- and if 50k is the new EL - I might be going Kia soon.The Tsx is still on the board- and according to c&d this caddy is a real player. "
"graphicguy","July 2012"," The Caddy that really interests me is the CTS-V. But, now you're talking about hitting that $70K range, where a lot of nice iron resides.So, it's not like they don't have any models that catches my eye.FN...rented a CTS coupe during an out of town business meeting. Was it nice? Yeah! Was it something I'd plop my own money down for? Not hardly.Like you, I always considered the CTS to be the competition for the 3 or A4 or C Class. Cadillac touted it as competition for the 5, A6 or E class. That doesn't make it true, though. So, now Cadillac is saying the ATS is the competitor for the 3, A4, C? We'll see.Once they show up at Hertz, I'll give one a spin.It scares me more than a little to see the complicated electronics in the ATS and realize this was a the brain child of GM. It could just as easily be a catastrophe for them as it would be a success. "

"flightnurse","July 2012"," M6, I truly hope the ATS is a success, I have never said other wise, in fact my partner and I have been waiting to build one, a FWD Turbo 4 Performance with manual and the options I like can be had for 42K. I wish I could compare that build ATS with a 2013 328i with the options I would want on it, I' thinking they will come out about the same price or close to it. But when it comes down to the hype, the ATS has fallen short, 270hp should be better then what GM has posted for the 0-60. Same can be said about the V6. I forgot who posted it, but I do not think the ATS will pull people out of their 3 series, but it will allow people who have a chevy or maybe a Buick into the Caddy showroom and upgrade to the ATS. Time will tell and again I hope the ATS is a success. "
"m6user","July 2012"," The following is from a blog post from Inside Line. Just for conversation.""The most reliable rumor-mongers have the ATS-V getting the same direct-injection, 5.5-liter, fifth-generation small-block V8 that's going into the C7 Corvette. If that naturally aspirated engine comes in around 460 hp, it would put the ATS-V a comfortable 100 ponies behind the supercharged 6.2-liter small-block V8 in the CTS-V.

"plekto","July 2012"," The thing that everyone seems to be missing with the ATS is that it's basically what the CTS should have been in the first place. It has a much shorter wheelbase and is several hundred pounds lighter. If you check videos online, you'll see a version of it screaming around the Nurburgring at silly fast speeds which is almost certainly a ATS-V prototype. Dropping that much weight makes a huge difference. "
"sweendogy","July 2012"," I don't think the cts- missed its mark- certainly when you add in the cts-v in all trims- fastest production sedan and a muscle wagon with a stick shift (that's when you turn the gears by hand). This is a car that helped keep the brand. "

"sweendogy","July 2012"," The comment that it saved the brand?No real world driving at all, would love to own a 6speed wagon Cts but out of my range at 70k.

Pretty amazing stuff from America. "
"flightnurse","July 2012"," Reading what others have commented and real world driving experience are completely different, there are times when I read Car and Driver and the comments I read about a car I have personally driven, differ then what the writers are saying. The CTS wagon is a good example, on paper it should be a winner, however the rear seat room is horrible, less space then a E90 3 series, the drivers seat while comfortable, not much legroom for me. Others have stated the same thing, the powertrain is only a portion of the car, it is how everything works together. The perfect example of this is the Vette, wonderful powertrain, very easy to drift the car and the wonderful baritone exhaust note but the interior is dated and cheap for the price point that GM charges. The ATS and XTS are the new Caddy and I hope that they succeed where caddy has failed in the past. CTS has been marginally successful and we all know the STS was a failure from the gate. "
"sweendogy","July 2012"," I agree real world driving is something you have to consider- but I would take car and driver, consumer reports and top gear over your comments from some rental car you picked up in Ohio, and drove for 2 days. It's your opinion and it's worth something to you, not everyone. While I agree the vett interior stinks, but like you stated the power train is terrific (easy to drift I guess you could add, and did :confuse: ), but it's still the best seller in the segment, why ? 430 hp for 50k. I have also stated in the past that I think the pre2011 3 series has a rather boring interior, and it's laughable they Charge you for paint and leather (this is a lux car right), Bluetooth and I have also stated for 35-40-50k you can get more powerful sedan for what BMW charges.Marginal success for the cts- past 2 years they have outsold the TL, 2008 was mot car of year And was 10 best for 2008 and 09, And 2010 and in 2010 MT said it maybe the best American car ever made.

In fact it was second best selling car in it's class behind BWM 3 series. The Vette is a car everybody wish's they could own, it is an American Icon, however, some of us have owned a vette and had a very poor experience with it. I believe the vette sells well, but it doesn't have the highest return customer based as other sports car do, and why is that? I believe Porsche has the highest repeat customer base, why is that? Better built cars? Better driving satisfaction? Can't be the price as the Porsche's prices keep going up.. Something keeps customers coming back to the brand. Again the question is, will the new ATS and XTS change peoples perception about GM and Caddy to keep people coming back to the brand. "
"rayainsw","July 2012"," FWIW - As someone who did drive a [ 2007 ] Corvette for over 30,000 miles, I will say this:I long wanted a top tier sports car.

"graphicguy","July 2012"," ray....interesting to note your experiences...especially with the 'vette. That's a car that I always said (well, since I was 16), I want to own one. I had friends buy them. I rode in them. I even had the opportunity to drive a Lingenfelter Corvette. Once I did, the allure diminished as I asked myself....""how much will I really drive this?""With a (then) wife, and a kid, the Corvette ""jones"" went away. Once the wife was gone, and the kid grew up, my tastes changed (to luxury sports sedans). I don't fall in love with my cars like others do. I know some Corvette aficionados who are die hard. I know many more who got their fix, and like you, let it go.I feel fortunate that I'm able to own some awfully fine cars...BMWs, Audis, Acuras, go fast Mustangs, etc. Had one Cadillac. Will never own another (a story for another time).FN...once the hype machine finishes on the ATS, we'll see how it shakes out. You're right, the CTS just started to be competitive with its last iteration. Even there, the competition has passed it by.The ATS may be a competitor to the 328i, or A4. But, how long will that last?The trade rags do a little track testing. Run around with a car for a few days, maybe a week. The most they drive a car is their ""long term"" fleet. Even there, that's only for a year, on average. And, not one person drives it for a long period of time.So, renting a car is a good way for someone to get a feel for it. I know I've been able to rent a Benz, a Caddy, a Volvo (surprisingly good), and some others. I actually was able to get a lengthy test drive (longer than a day) on a BMW, Audi S4 and a Cadillac CTS coupe (which gave me the opportunity to cross it off my list). You come to some very realistic conclusions that the trade rags don't pay much attention to driving and using them as you would on a daily basis. "
"rayainsw","July 2012"," '..the allure diminished as I asked myself....""how much will I really drive this?""

"fedlawman","July 2012"," I value magazine reviews of cars, but I take the opinions with a grain of salt. A road test done in isolation is good for a general overview of a car, but unless it is a comparison test with other cars, it is of limited value.A comparison test is better because memory of the cars is fresh and the venue, conditions, etc. are the same, making for a more accurate review. But still, all people are influenced by expectation bias and so there is no such thing as an unbiased and impartial road test.In the end, in choosing a car, you have to take in all the info and facts that are out there, test drive the car (hopefully long enough to discover the nits like the glare on the instruments when the sun is at certain angles, or that pressure point in the seat back that you won't notice until an hour of driving) and make a decision. With cars of this caliber, it will often be a decision of value, comfort, and aesthetics more than sheer performance.As for the ATS, until I see and drive it in person and see some instrumented performance testing alongside it's peers (same day, same track), I will reserve judgement on it. "
"flightnurse","July 2012"," M6, I think you need to reread what was written, ""with all the hype the ATS has had, the ATS better come out swinging, and swing hard."" The objective data that has been pointed out, with a car that makes more HP then BMW, one would assume the ATS would be faster. Subjective, the ATS is not faster. Again, I hope the ATS is a winner, competition only makes things better. With 30+ more HP and less weight then a 328i why isn't the ATS faster? Is BMW underrating the 2l turbo motor or is GM overrating the ATS engine? When a car is driving on a track this does not relate to real world driving experience, since the surface of the track is ultra smooth. Having a rental of the same car give a real work driving experience, remember, the rental car is usually the mid-line model, not the over the top end version that car mags get. Like Graphic, having rented some cars have saved me some mistakes, the CTS would have been one of them. The new Chrysler 300 is another perfect example, I was not that impressed with the first Gen, the second gen I like a lot, easier to see traffic lights and the fit and finish is much better, I wouldn't have known this if I had not rented the car. The V6 with the 8 spd transmission is a great combo, this is one car I agree with the auto mag's. "
"flightnurse","July 2012"," Ray I agree with you on your take of the Vette.. Lots of fun.. But not something I wont to keep long term. "
"dino001","July 2012"," Acceleration is due to torque, not horsepower. 328i torque is 255 lb-ft at 1250-4800 rpm, i.e. it gets maximum torque really fast and stays there for duration. ATS 2.0 has 260 lb-ft at 1700-5500 rpm. So those figures are about even, ATS higher horsepower is basically achieved by longer curve, i.e. you get benefit at screaming engine speeds. ATS higher torque starts a little higher rpm, which could make a difference in those 0-60 tests and possibly rolling start. Quarter mile and passing (40-60, 50-70 or similar) numbers are more important in real driving conditions - does anybody know those?Another factor would be energy efficiency of parts (internal friction) and load from electrical power devices. The more stuff the vehicle has, the more drain it will experience. Aerodynamics is another thing, important at higher speeds, over 40 mph. All those factors would contribute to test numbers. "
"flightnurse","July 2012"," Hey Dino, the Regal GS makes 295lbs of torque with 270hp, the 0-60 times is 6.3 seconds. Is this because it is FWD? "
"m6user","July 2012"," ""With the former(referring to ATS RWD version), the factory-estimated 0-to-60-mph time is 5.4 seconds, exactly the same as that of the 335i.""above from Automobilemag.com which was testing the 3.6l, automatic.Slower? Inside Line did a full test on the 2.0L 328, manual, and the 0-60 was 5.9 sec. The ATS is supposed to do it in 5.7 according to GM. Since I haven't seen any third party documented testing for the ATS 2.0, manual, it will be yet to be determined. So I don't know where you're getting all your info. However, I think it's too early to automatically call it slower. Do you have some real data that says that the ATS 2.0L(the volume seller) is actually slower than the 328? I haven't seen it. In fact Motor Trend has the ATS beating the 335 on the skidpad in case you care about that sort of thing rather than rear seat room.I think most of the mags drive the cars both on the track and in daily driving. The fact that most of the tests done so far on the ATS have been preproduction models at a raceway isn't the cars fault. Full tests will arrive shortly which is why I find it curious that you bashed it so quickly. Bias maybe? A lot car mag/blog outfits actually use the cars for a week or so to commute to work, haul stuff, etc besides doing some performance testing. Those are the ones that interest me more so than just a half day at the track type review. Comparisons like Fedlawman mentioned are also beneficial when cars are tested and driven back to back. Can't get that type of experience flying in and renting a car for a couple of days. "
"sweendogy","July 2012"," M6 you hit it on the head, comments without fact are just opinions, which mean nothing- & you are right on the bias issue - its a joke.

"graphicguy","July 2012"," So renting a car while on a business trip for a couple of days is a better test than the above?Yes!How much track testing is done on a business rental?None! I have track time, too. As just one example, I don't dump clutches from 4K rpm to get 0-60 times as that's not real world. I don't track my daily drivers. A couple days rental is better because it's ""real world"" compared to several weeks of driving by several different professional reviewers during a year long test?See above. I don't need a journalist to tell me if a car is good or not. Again, I have a goodly amount of track experience, too.Like FN, I rent and drive a lot of cars during my business travels. That gives me a really good baseline of how any particular brand, model, car fits what I want in a car....not what a journalist tells me I must have.I consider the trade rags to be entertaining.

I'm just saying that I just can't remember ever renting, on a business trip, the exact car I was looking at. As far as really getting to know a car while on a business trip it didn't seem like a good evaluation for me as I was usually trying to find my way around on strange roads and in a hurry. In fact, I remember renting a couple of Nissans one time and hated them. I later bought a 1996 Maxima. Based on my rental car experiences I never should have even considered a Nissan. But based on a lot of very postive reviews of the Maxima it peaked my interest and I rented one from a dealer for three days and drove it extensively with the soul purpose of evaluation. Ended up buying a loaded Maxima and loved it. It was a great car that really was in another league compared to the models that I had got for rental cars. It rode and handled great with plenty of pep and enough luxury for me at the time. Just proved to me that renting something in the brand didn't necessarily give me a good picture of all the models and how different they can be. Even now a Maxima is nearly Infiniti like while the Altima and others are, well, like Nissans. "
"dino001","July 2012"," FWD may be part of it - the mechanical losses are I think less (shorter shafts), but pulling is always less efficient than pushing and it must be more significant, otherwise race cars would be FWD.

I look at the specs and the performance panels (with the understanding of what they did to extract those numbers). That's about as far as it goes.But, at the end of the day, they're still journalists whose opinion is no more valid than anyone else's.My favorite was Patrick Bedard of C&D.

This is the first car I have ever owned that seems to be deft at hiding the miles it shows on the odometer (20,000+ in 11 months). The Germans I have had showed their age unless they were ""over maintained.""In fact there has only been one -- troubling -- issue with the car. The front brakes at 8,000 miles were warped (and ""turned"" as part of the warranty.) Again at 20,000 miles the tell-tale shuddering of warped rotors returned and they were again resurfaced. Today, two days after the resurfacing, the brakes feel ""the way they should"" in my opinion.While the car was in for an oil change, tire rotation and brake resurfacing, my loaner car was a 2012 TL Tech. Not AWD, not Advance -- simply a nice 3.5L FWD TL with the tech package.Previous loaners have always been new MDX's -- I can't remember when I actually had driven a TL that was not AWD and not Advance, in fact.To cut to the message: I get out of my TL and into the FWD TL and motor off to run errands and drive all over the city of Columbus, OH for a few hours -- my first thought within one mile, ""this car is a sofa."" Had they given me a Lexus instead?OK, here's my impression -- the TL FWD falls over its tires, i.e., understeers easily, has torque steer aplenty and is unimpressive for a car that probably lists (as my loaner was) close to $40K. There is no way it belongs in any discussion -- while keeping a straight face -- called Entry Level Luxury Performance Sedans. It feels like an Accord or a Camry (or perhaps Avalon) for pity's sake. The steering is way overboosted and there doesn't appear to be any device affixed to the thing that provides any resistance to the massive body roll and exacerbated understeer this thing is capable of demonstrating.No wonder all the good stuff written about the TL (for 2012) is about the SH-AWD Advance version -- without that level of trim, the thing is practically a joke with respect to ""performance"" entry level or other-wise.I had no idea the difference would be so pronounced.While I was there, I looked at the new RDX -- now without SH-AWD (good looking, upscale Honda CRV, NO SH-AWD, what were they thinking?) and the ILX -- better looking than a Civic but with a puny engine and 5 speed automatic, again it makes me wonder ""what were they thinking?""The TL, as mine is configured when driven back to back with an Audi S4, made me think, the TL was (for the money) an S4-lite (or S4 like) for $11,000+ less money. Going from the German cars I have been used to in my garage since 1978 to the TL was, with this model, not terribly difficult. It does appear that Acura needs to really step up its game to be in the ELLPS crowd. As of my day in the life this weekend, I would say Acura is on probation to remain a member of this group.2014 can't come soon enough! :shades: "
"m6user","July 2012"," ""While I was there, I looked at the new RDX -- now without SH-AWD (good looking, upscale Honda CRV, NO SH-AWD, what were they thinking?)""I think they were thinking that the RDX with SH-AWD turbo 4 was selling like electric blankets in July and they had to either change it drastically or get rid of it. The new RDX is selling like crazy. So it appears that there were lots of people that SAID they loved the turbo and SH-AWD but those same people were not BUYING them. It's easy to say a company should do this or that when you have no skin in the game. However, if you're trying to make a profit you have to design and sell vehicles people will actually buy and not just post about on so-called enthusiusts forums. "
"billyperksii","July 2012"," Mark 20K in 11 months, that's a whole lot of driving.I have 18K and I am going on 3yrs (8/17 exactly).I guess I will have enough equity in my car when the 2014 hits the showrooms. "
"graphicguy","July 2012"," Mark...appreciate your thoughts. I loved my TL SH AWD. As you say, it's an ""S4 lite"".Be anxious to see what the TL will become, if they release an ""S"" version, will there be a future TL model, at all? "
"markcincinnati","July 2012"," Supposedly -- the next TL will be called, in keeping with the new nomenclature, TLX. Of course this is confusing or could be to anyone who knows the way the car biz names things -- X's typically mean cars that are ALL WHEELS DRIVEN (328ix, M37X, X6, FX56 and so forth.)Also, for those shopping this apparent class of car, the transmission choices should never include fewer than 6 speeds and often what is needed to be compared with the best is 7 or 8 speeds (and, if possible a 6 speed stick.)If one of your key features and differentiators has been SH-AWD, Torque Vectoring, or whatever that special secret sauce is, dumbing down the line also is a way to telegraph you're place on the Premium Class pecking order is falling not rising.I suspect Acura does OK financially due to the popularity of the MDX. The dealer I use in Columbus had dozens and dozens of MDX's and not much of anything/everything else. I swear I saw no RL's of any MY, no ZDX's (but I really think that the ZDX is dead and no one has been informed, yet), a few ILX's and a few RDX's. I have no issue with Acura making a decision to slide gracefully out of, off of the Premium Class list -- and maybe that is what is being done. Somehow it seems, however, that they're oblivious to what is going on around them.I used to think of Acura as the Japanese Audi -- no more. In fact I can't seem to find any descriptive term that fits the line. Their cars, and I now have the proof, are all over the map. I used to think of Acuras as ""members of the club"" -- now I'm pretty certain they're no longer members and that maybe they don't know it or don't care. :surprise: "
"m6user","July 2012"," It seems to me that Acura has decided to compete more directly with Lexus as evidenced by the new RDX which is clearly aimed at the RX. The RX is certainly a premium or luxury vehicle but also not a great driver or handler. As to is whether it is premium or not? What is the definition of premium? Is it track performance or luxury appointments or does it have to be both? Does it include dealer experience or is just how a car accelerates and handles. Now, the title of this particular discussion happens to be Entry Level Luxury Performance Sedans. There are going to the vehicles that are clearly no brainers and there are going to vehicles that are at the very bottom of the list and up for some discussion as to whether they belong or not. The base TL is very similar to ES but the TL SH-AWD is closer to the GS. The TSX V6 is close to the IS350.Have to agree that Acura seems to have drifted away from the performance aspect that many liked about it in years past. I think they still have a good premium/luxury product that is comparable in quality to all the rest but may be towards the bottom of the ranking and not towards the top. Somebody always has to represent the bottom of a catergory and it appears Acura is that somebody.As long as they keep selling a ton of MDX and now the new RDX and a good number of TL and TSX they are probably happy. Even though a bunch of enthusiusts would like every car they build be track worthy. They might not be as lost as some would think but have found a way to compete better against Lexus and Infiniti which I think, in their eyes, are their biggest competitors. I think sometimes we forget that Honda is a much smaller company than Toyota, Nissan, VAG, Mercedes, BMW, GM etc and cannot and will not try to compete on all levels as they do. Little more niche IMO. "
"sweendogy","July 2012"," I'm amazed that this is now a topic- Acura died with the deaths of the NSx and the integra - would also throw the no coupe, no convertible, no sports car, terrible flagship, no v8, dropping the turbo 4, the second tsx, the beak of the line, the Zdx, the delay in a 6speed auto, fwd... I need to take a breath - I'm missing a fewthings - this was a thougth 4 years ago Now it's obvious- just like its obvious that the tsx (gen 2) should never have been included in Ellps- I agree standard TL should go as well.Curse of the beak. "
"plekto","July 2012"," The Acura TSX is actually a re-badged Accord. In Japan, it sells as the ""Accord"". So it's not viable for this category at all - not even close. No matter what lipstick and dress they put on the thing, it's still not a luxury car.How does this tie into the TL?The TL is sold as an extra-large Accord over there. Essentially exactly what Toyota did with the Camry and Avalon. Same basic idea, just larger. Honda is pimping it out as a luxury car, but it's really a large family sedan. Essentially a Japanese Buick Lucerne.It's simply not part of this category, at least not in Japan it wouldn't be. Perhaps because we have such a miserable selection of good cars in the U.S. compared to most of the rest of the world we might consider it to be a performance sedan, but it's really not.I'd buy a CTS over a TL in a millisecond. "
"m6user","July 2012"," Is a CTS-V quite a bit different car than the base CTS? Is the Shelby Mustang quite a different car than a base V6 Mustang? I don't believe just because a car is sold somwhere else that outfitting the car completely different doesn't change the character of the car. The same can be said of the Honda CR-X and the Acura RDX. They share some(very little) attributes but one only has to feel and drive them to understand they are not the same vehicle whatsoever. The people that say the new RDX is just a CR-X with some lipstick are clearly ill informed and probably have not been in both but just repeating others. I'm sure there are many more examples of plainjane autos that with the right equipment become completely different experiences. I really don't know much about the Euro Accord except that the TSX is based on it. I guess I'm not that hung up on the fact that a premium car here is not considered a premium car elsewhere and I don't worry about what is offered in other countries that we don't get here either. If it bothered me that much I guess I'd have to move there or quit bitchin about it. "
"plekto","July 2012"," But... quite literally, the TSX *is* the Accord in Japan. No change. They just swap the console over to the left side, change the lights and so on to U.S. DOT approved ones, change the nav system (if equipped) to a U.S. one, slap an Accura badge on it, and it's done. The TSX *is* a great car, mind you, but as the real Accord, you'd expect it to be. What we get as the ""Accord"" over here is actually an in-between car, much like how the Corolla is in between the Camry and the Yaris. In Japan, to compete with Toyota, they actually sell four main levels. Toyota would be Yaris/Corolla/Camry/Avalon. Honda is City/Civic/Inspire(U.S. Accord)/Accord(U.S. TSX) all ""Honda"" on the badge.All not premium cars in Japan or Europe, either. It's such a scummy tactic to offer us fewer dumbed-down cars and then charge us a significant up-charge for an Acura badge. It's big, soft, and front wheel drive. The 4 cylinder engine is noisy and rough, the steering is vague, and while it's lovely to look at, and has a great interior, it's simply not even close to cars like the C class, the CTS, and the G37. Let alone a 3 series. "
"graphicguy","July 2012"," Mark....interesting take. There's a certain contingency that remember the Legend as the car that built Acura. That's overall true.However, that recipe (powerful motor, technologically top of class, premium ride/handling, premium build/materials, for less money than the Germans) doesn't seem to be on Acura is following any more.I don't know if they can't build that anymore, or they choose not to. But, regardless of the classification, they still build good cars. Frankly, I've seen all the Japanese marks falter a bit since the tsunami and resultant nuke meltdown occurred. Who knows? It could take another decade for the likes of Honda/Acura, Nissan/Infiniti, Toyota/Lexus to recover.I would say that maybe Acura hasn't kept pace with the other Lux/performance cars we've talked about here. But, I contend they're still good cars (i.e. your TL SH AWD).I know they would have kept me in the fold if the current TL would have kept pace with the Germans. So far, not even the newly released Lexi, Acura, and Infinitis have been able to do that.You want to see, feel, hear where the money goes in the premium you pay for BMWs and Audis, listen to the drivetrain, test the suspension, notice the ride/handling balance, look at the premium materials they use, and the solidity of their build. That's where you can tell the biggest differences.Obviously, you already know this since you've owned the German brands. "
"fedlawman","July 2012"," What about all the BMW 3 series 1.8 and 2.0L sedans in Europe? Cloth seats, steel wheels, etc. - they aren't considered ""premium cars"" over there. "
"markcincinnati","July 2012"," I test drove a CTS/4 Premium Luxury with the 19"" wheel option and the FE2 suspension. This was the day I test drove an Audi S4 and the TL SH-AWD Advance.The Cadillac was the least desirable of the three -- IF one had any lust for even a hint of performance. The 3.6 engine seemed enthusastic in its sounds and refinement but was unable to press you back in the seat at full throttle. The feeling in the CTS was ""same day service."" The CTS lacked the driver and passenger above-door handles that even the least expensive VW's offer -- and it's not like passengers would have no use for them. This symbolically told me where Cadillac's head was, and that is Cadillac's head is up its nose!Now, for the money (not MSRP, lease money per month, that is) the pecking order (from low payment to high) was Acura TL SH-AWD Advance, Cadillac CTS/4 Premium Luxury and the S4 (Prestige). At these respective levels of trim each of the three offered about the same content (although the Cadillac didn't have blind spot monitoring which seems like a glaring oversight.)If Acura is trying to compete with Infiniti, I know of none of their cars that offers the performance level, interior poshness or HP for the buck offered by Infiniti. I do like my Acura (which is $547/mo for 36 months) -- I am not crazy about the styling (exterior) and there is very little ""premium"" anything in the interior except the heated and ventilated seats -- the 2012 Acura does a decent impression of my 2005 Audi A6 (which had the +sized wheels and tires, but no sport suspension, but w/sport seats) -- and the SH-AWD allows the TL to perform ""similarly"" to an Audi S4 (S4-Lite, i.e.)Rumors are rumors and who knows what is real -- so I am planning on keeping my mind open about a 2014 TLX, Cadillac ATS/4, Audi A? and both the G and M Infiniti's.I am looking for my next car to have what appears to be the reliability and durability of my '12 Acura and my wife's '11 Infiniti (and the performance of at least an Audi A4 in terms of handling.) The Audi may have to be removed from my list, in fact, due to my suspicions that virtually any German car on the market (and I have had 29 of them) shows and feels its age more quickly than the Japanese (and maybe even than the Cadillac, I have no experience with that.)I priced out an ATS/4 with the turbo four and premium pack -- it turned out to be just south of $50K -- with a 6 speed auto. Word is there will be an 8-speed auto ""soon."" Might be worth a look-see.If the greatest gripe I have is that the lesser TL's have no place on either the ELLPS or LPS boards, but that the top o' the line SH-AWD version is decent -- well, I think we all are in pretty good shape with any of these vehicles if configured to match one's proclivities. Still, 2014 can't come soon enough! :surprise: "
"flightnurse","July 2012"," It seems to me that Acura has decided to compete more directly with Lexus as evidenced by the new RDX which is clearly aimed at the RX. The RX is certainly a premium or luxury vehicle but also not a great driver or handler. I disagree, the MDX is the direct competitor of the RX, in both price and size. Lexus does not have a RDX/X3/EX competitor as of yet and I don't believe Lexus has to have another SUV in it's lineup. "
"markcincinnati","July 2012"," The comparison that makes the most sense, size-wise and price-wise is to compare the MDX to the RX. I don't believe there is a car in the Lexus lineup that in similar in size/class, etc to the RDX.I have NOT driven the RDX. I have read reports and sat in one. The RDX is a nice step up from the old RDX -- in terms of ""styling."" In every other way that I can think of, the new RDX is clearly a nice, a fancier a ""better"" CR-V in about every way that I can think of.At the current moment, I would look closely at a new BMW X1 (w the turbo i4) over the RDX. I'd probably look at a Q5 over the RDX, too.Now then, offer up the SH-AWD on the RDX and it becomes the pick of the litter since it would be a bargain, or at least one would think it ought to be.For the record, as if there is a record, I do not track my cars -- I look at SH-AWD as both a performance improvement on regular roads and a safety feature considering the understeering habits of virtually all FWD and non-SH-AWD, AWD versions.Drive it like YOU live! "
"flightnurse","July 2012"," Graphic while the Legend was a good car, I believe what set Acura apart from everybody else was it's dealership and how they treated the customer. Loaner cars, greeting the customer with a smile, going to the customers place of work and exchanging cars. Going beyond the typical dealership experience that was being offered in 1986, even by the Germans. "
"robr2","July 2012"," The TL is sold as an extra-large Accord over there.Actually you're wrong on this count.The North America Accord is sold over in Japan as the Inspire. The TL isn't offered there at all as it was replaced by our Accord.Yes the TSX is the JDM/Euro Accord. It is a bit of a pedestrian car in those markets and with good reason - that's what sells. Bringing it here as the TSX was a way to get people in the door of Acura dealers as the TL was getting bigger and more expensive.Is it an ELLP? That's up to the buyer to decide. By offering it with a V6 in North America (it's not offered that way in the other markets) was a way to bring it up to ELLP standards although the 4 offers sufficient engine and chassis performance. "
"graphicguy","July 2012"," Mark...I enjoy reading your impressions. Although, my GF's S4 is the first Audi I've experienced, it is a step above (actually, a couple of steps above) my former TL SH AWD....regardless of the parameters I use to measure both of them. The S4 performs better, has better materials, etc.I've had 3 BMWs. And, all of them have been as stout as anything I've ever owned. So, we'll have to disagree about how they age.I've mentioned before, I've tried to like Infinitis. I've test driven (several times) the new M37 and the G37. While the have the ""window dressing"" down pretty well. The refinement and suspension work is where they fall down....at least compared to what I drive.I thought the M37 was very nice on the inside, however. I've never been able to warm to the exterior styling of either the G or the M. M was cheaper than the GF's S4. We still didn't like it.FN.....I think everyone in the Acura community is awaiting the worthy successor to the Legend, for all the reasons you state. It hasn't happened yet. "
"flightnurse","July 2012"," Is a CTS-V quite a bit different car than the base CTS? Is the Shelby Mustang quite a different car than a base V6 Mustang? I don't believe just because a car is sold somwhere else that outfitting the car completely different doesn't change the character of the car.I would say yes, just as there is quite a difference between a 528i and a M5, basic body shell, but after that completely different car. "
"flightnurse","July 2012"," Is it an ELLP? That's up to the buyer to decide.Not on this board some people have decided for the whole group that the TSX does not belong here. However, I agree, the buyer is the one who decides their money. "
"flightnurse","July 2012"," I've had 3 BMWs. And, all of them have been as stout as anything I've ever owned. So, we'll have to disagree about how they age. Graphic I agree here too, my 05 has no rattles, and the body alignment is perfect not bad for a car that has been tracked. Mark has made comment the age thing a couple of times, I wish he would give examples. "
"m6user","July 2012"," Actually we're both right. The RX competes against both. If you look at size the RX is smack dab in between the RDX and MDX but is actually closer in size to the RDX. It's a five passenger like the RDX, rides and handles similar to the RDX and has almost the same powertrain as the RDX. The MDX is bigger, holds 7 pax, has the sportier engine and also SH-AWD. The main thing the RX and MDX have in common is the price. I think with the redesign of the RAV-4(after a long in the tooth run) you may see a Lexus CUV based on that and a stretched RX go to 7 pax seating to compete more directly with the MDX and JX. I think if anything goes in the Lexus lineup it may be one or more of the more traditional based SUVs. There is already rumors of a Lexus version of the Prius V. "
"m6user","July 2012"," That was my point exactly. Just because a car is based on something equestrian doesn't mean with the right drivetrain/suspension/luxury fittings the car isn't a different beast. "
"markcincinnati","July 2012"," I agree completely with your comments re:Audi S4. I likened the TL SH-AWD Advance 6 speed auto to an S4, but it is S4-lite or S4-like -- I use those words, phrases in an attempt to offer up my impressions as a long-time Audi owner (who has also had 3 BMW's). I don't think most folks would ever cross shop these two cars.I was looking for another A4 Prestige with sport package, etc, but I was also looking to keep the payments UNDER $600 per month. Couldn't do it with the content I wanted in the car. The A4 Prestige content and the TL SH-AWD Advance have similar content. The TL and A4 have similar wheel bases and both are ""nice"" cars -- with the nod going to the A4 on all counts.If I were forced to keep the TL for 5 more years, I think I could live with that, since the TL refuses to betray its mileage. By this time on my A4 (20K miles) there were ""feelable"" signs of wear (not tear, just wear) -- which also goes for the 3 BMW's we had. The BMW dealer said to us that BMW's are higher performance machines and they are built to outperform their competition at the cost of needing to be fiddled with, adjusted and tweaked more than the other cars that have lower tolerances and so forth.This proved true with Audis too -- even as they got better and better in terms of reliability. My experience is just another data point: German Cars, Japanese Cars and I assume [hope] American Cars are all reliable (getting stranded in the wrong part of town just doesn't happen in a modern car like we're talking about.) What little disagreement we have or may have is that the German Cars seem to require ""lots of little adjustments"" to keep them feeling young -- the Japanese Cars, on the other hand, ""feel"" (at 30,000 miles in the case of my wife's Infiniti and at 20,000 miles in the case of my Acura) unfazed by the passage of so many miles.I'd take an S4 over virtually any of the cars in this class -- if money wasn't an object. Of course an S6 would be, for me, even better. I had an A8 upgraded at the dealer to an S8 suspension that I had them order from Germany -- now that was very nice. Today, however, I'd still prefer the S6 over the S8 even if I were spending ""other people's money."" The S4 and especially the S6 seem to be great ""middle sized"" vehicles -- and both are fun to drive. I may have shared this before, but my 1995 S6 remains my favorite car of all times -- not the BEST car I ever had, just the one that recalls the fondest of fond memories. "
"sweendogy","July 2012"," Rob2, just because Acura dropped a v6 into the tsx doesn't make it Ellps- first of all they sell less then 10% of all v6 tsxs. Second doesn't the accord offer a v6? "

"graphicguy","August 2012"," Mark.....you and I pretty much are violently agreeing. Audi, Acura, Mercedes (every once in awhile) and now BMW...all offer 4 cyl motors in their ELLPS. I test drove an A5. Frankly, that's a mighty nice car. Matter of fact, even though it's down on HP vs BMW's new N20 motor, I'd still prefer it over a new 328i.I'm still trying to wrap my mind around being able to hit the $50K mark with the 328i and a 4 cyl (optioned up). Personally, there are still plenty of new '11 328i cars on the market (BMW cranked production on the '11s knowing the '12s would be initially only a trickle coming out of the factory). I'd jump on one of those with the 6 cyl....save me some money and get something I consider to be superior to the newer model.I know it's next to impossible to get a '12 335i (although you can find old body style coupes on lots, still). And, I don't think they only started producing the '13 335i. GF's S4 is a Premium Plus. Seems loaded up to me. What does the Prestige net you?I don't think an A4 can be optioned up to $50K like the 328i, can it?As you're aware, all loaded up, I think the TL SH AWD Tech is low-mid $40s. I thought you could get a loaded A4 quatro for about the same price?Either way, you have a very nice car which would be a pleasure to drive for the next 10 years, if you so choose. "
"markcincinnati","August 2012"," An Audi A4 2.0T Prestige can be cranked up MSRP-wise to more than $50K.An Acura TL SH-AWD Advance (not Tech) plus a la carte options like splash guards and back-up sensors is north of $47K MSRP. The Prestige vs the Advance offers similar content if not similar engine transmission set ups.The way the '12 Acura TL is configured however -- it feels more like the Audi A6 version C6 (the last model before the current body style of the A6.)The BMW 328/AWD ('13) is easy to zoom past $50K, too.The SH-AWD (aka torque vectoring) masks the porkiness of the TL, and the 19"" wheels and ""sport tuned"" suspension yield a TL that is more like an A4-SLine or S4 ""lite"" -- the A4 currently only offers the ""sport differential"" on the highest buck flavors which makes the TL the bargain of the bunch (and still an ugly duckling.)I priced out a new X1 and even got that to go north of $50K (and that was with the 4cyclinder).There's a phrase I have grown up with: ""you can pay too little, but you really won't pay too much -- if you get what you want, rather than settling.""Oddly, with the TL at $547 per month, I feel a bit like Goldilocks, ""It's just right."" I can say this with a straight face since the '09 A4 2.0T Prestige w/sport and ADS was about $120 more per month than the TL.Don't confuse my rationalization as anything but ""driving it the way I lived -- at the time I entered into the transaction."" I was looking for something that I could live with, feel safe and comfortable with and that had decent performance -- AND was a prudent choice during a crappy economy.Still, however, I think 2014 can't come soon enough (for Acrua at least.) The company seems adrift -- even after the Avenger's movie was supposed to show us that Tony Stark used to drive Audis and now he drives Acura's.Pull the other one. :blush: "

"graphicguy","August 2012"," Mark....I'm not a lessee/payment buyer. So, the monthly payments have no relevance on my end. But, from what I understand, BMW subsidizes their leases pretty heavily. So, that's one way of allaying their cost. I also didn't know you could get an A4 into the $50K range. New lesson learned. Personally, if I were going to option out an A4 into that price range, I'd go ahead and move right on into an S4. Speaking of 4 cyl lux/performance cars, I just read a C&D article stating that Audi is upgrading their current 2.0 engine. Expect it to come in at around that 240 HP mark (not sure about ft/lb ratings) in the A4. "

It appears that both BMW and MB are slowly ditching their V12 engine in favor of a twin turbo V8. Ford took a big risk in their F150 by offering their EcoBoost 3.5L twin turbo engine, however, it has been a sales success for them. With CAFE # climbing quickly manufactures are being forced to offer engines they wouldn't have 5 yrs ago. MB offers more cars with Diesels then VW and they sell every one of them. BMW will be bring over a new 3 series oil burner for 2013 and I believe Audi will be doing the same.

"markcincinnati","August 2012"," Warped rotors make a sound and usually a feel. The term that describes the feel is shudder or shuddering. The sound that is made will remind you of the sound you hear when your ABS brakes are activated. The ABS could be said to pulse rapidly -- typically the warp sensation although similar to the pulsing sensation of ABS is somewhat more violent.The higher the speed the more the shuddering is noticeable and the louder it is too. As the warp becomes more and more severe, the onset of the shuddering is at lower and lower speeds. Mine was seemingly cured by the rotors being resurfaced or turned as it is called.Some rotors cannot be turned without serious longentivity issues. Acura claims their rotors are thick enough to withstand up to three turns. The price of the rotors at an Acura dealer (front pair) installed is about $350 for new Acura replacements.Acura's brakes are fine for most normal driving, but they seem a bit delicate and are not fans of heat (not that any rotors are, it's just that Acura's seem particularly prone to disliking heat.) I can't imagine having this car in the mountains or living with mountains with brakes as intolerant of heat as these.I have no idea why (other than $) a more durable or heat tolerant rotor is not used, especially when we're probably talking about a relatively small $ number to set the car up with bullet proof brakes.My wife's BMWs and my most recent Audis had excellent brakes -- I know they're out there.

Well, maybe not so hard, but it is not that easy and a lot of compromise is needed (wrong engine, wrong drive, no leather, basic wheels, the list will go on). Look also at those higher (larger/more luxurious) categories. Yes, there will be something there at $50 grand, but it's probably not what anyone shopping there would want. $60K is probably minimum for things to be ""nice"" and after putting ""everything"" you'll easily cross seventy ... and back off.EVERYTHING IS UP - deal with that!

Or isn't it true that those who ""need"" current technology, efficiency and performance will want to refresh their cars more often?Doesn't the above (if accurate) suggest that we consumers might want to take the approach that many companies take, which is to elect to have permanent payments on IT infrastructure (both real and virtual) in order to always stay current? Car companies rely on a consumer that will refresh his car every 36 months to 39 months -- and the most practical way to justify this is to ""rent"" cars much in the same way technology is rented (or subscribed to?)In my office building is my tech firm and a CPA firm, the CPA managing partner says you must either lease a new car and resign yourself to permanent monthly payments or buy a car and keep it a minimum of 10-years (and the 10 year number is the break-even number.)My consultant friend had a 550 (BMW) and when the lease was up on it, he looked at another Bimmer and -- sit down -- a top o' the line Genesis. At that moment in history, the Genesis lease was $299 per month. His decision Genesis and his thoughts are ""if possible"" to pay $299 per month ""forever"" and always have a new or nearly new car.Sure you can (I did) argue that there is no comparison between a 550 and the Genesis. Well, this guy, far as I can tell, could afford virtually anything without a second thought probably into the low 6-figures. But the depreciation was taking the fun out of owning, so he switched to leasing, then even that wasn't much fun anymore, especially when he swears he has given up ""oh so little"" to have that new Genesis; well, he has given up the high cost. I dunno, maybe its the hangover from the Great Recession, maybe its the phase of the moon -- or climate change. The prices keep going up, that much is certain.What also is happening is that few companies own airplanes either -- they rent them (and there is at least some argument that would justify buying a jet -- since they are practically rebuilt annually.)The glut of cars, the economy and people feeling they don't want to drive yesterday's news seems to be pressing ""us"" to drive younger and younger cars, despite their breath-taking drop in value.I'll tell you how crazy this is, if you don't think cross shopping a 550 with a Genesis is crazy enough, my commercial banker neighbor went from a V12 Mercedes full sized coupe to a Sonata (again, not for any lack of ability on his part to front the money.)Maybe he just didn't want to be considered part of the 1%.Hell it's hot. :confuse: "

Really? Not a very smart CPA IMHO unless he is looking at leasing from only a business perspective. I don't think very many private owners who cannot take advantage of business tax laws would agree with that.I always buy - always have. I've never been offered a lease deal that could be better for me than an outright purchase. Now I used to have a co-worker who would always lease because he never wanted to be out of warranty. But he was a high mileage driver and insisted on zero down, 20K miles per year and an extended warranty to 60K. At one time he leased a Jetta for almost $500 a month. And he was fine with that. Heck, he could've financed the whole thing for maybe $40 a month more and owned it outright. "

I guess what I feel is that $50K for a 3 series isn't a great value. But value is a subjective measure where price is an objective measure.Now I can't see why BMW doesn't produce the 3 series in Spartanburg for North American consumption. If people are willing to fork over $50K for a 3, why not build it here and cut out the Euro penalty? BMW could probably increase gross profit by 20%. "
"fedlawman","August 2012"," 10 years ago when this thread was started, the entry-level segment was defined by the E46 3-series, Acura TL, Audi A4, Lexus IS300, and the G35. All of them started at or just below $30,000.Of course, back then cars still had cassette players and 0-60 in 7 secs was considered quick. This segment has probably seen the biggest gains in performance and technology over the last decade than any other segment.I suppose that a $10,000 average price hike over a ten year period is reasonable when considered logically, but emotionally it just seems like an invisible line was crossed. $40,000+ just seems like a lot of money to me for a group of relatively ubiquitous cars.

"nyccarguy","August 2012"," Wow, you guys have been quite chatty since I last checked in. I'm back in CT after driving 1700 miles through 10 states.I agree with you guys that Acura has completely LOST ITS WAY. The TL SH-AWD is the exception here. The Acura brakes stink. Our government should mandate that BMW supply brakes to every car on the road. Prices on these cars have crept up over the years. As you all know, my 2011 328xi is leased (I know its more expensive to lease, but its going to be a damn fun 30 months). $50K for a 4 cyl 3 series is a big pill to swallow. Like many of you have said, $50K is NOT entry level. In my book anyway. I'm quite certain that if I do want to continue to drive sedans in this category when the lease is up on my 3er in 2 years, I'm going to have to go the CPO route. Otherwise I'll have to look at a car that isn't so performance oriented to suite my commuting needs. "
"plekto","August 2012"," The thing with Honda and Toyota is that that have been trying to follow Cadillac and Mercedes. Now, this isn't a *bad* thing. The C class is a superb car to get around town in in style without breaking the bank. GM makes superb big boats that float down the road and are kind on your old back.There's a reason the Lexus ES is called a ""Japanese Buick"". Acura rightly figured that since it couldn't make a better car than the 3 series, they should just go where the money is - in big comfy cars. Fair enough. The TL is a very nice car inside and is great to just drive around town and get stuck in traffic in But Toyota and Honda are a lot like GM in that there's a hard division between sports and luxury, with only one or two vehicles that bridge that gap. (possibly the Lexus IS and the CTS, Honda has nothing any more since they dropped the RSX) "
"dino001","August 2012"," I kind started it, but now I have to add one small contradiction to what was said: sure cars went up 20-30% over ten years. This is much more than average wage increase (except perhaps the top earners, who seem to enjoy way better growth than rest of us). In those terms, cars should not cost more than 10-15%. Part of the rest could be explained by commodity inflation outpacing the wage inflation, especially in late '00s and even now it is not all gone (I just can't imagine how much box of corn flakes will cost next year). There was a huge dollar debasement in late '00s, somewhat recovering now, but it's a fact (if anybody cares to remember, 1 Euro was about 90 US cents in early 2000s). All of those things contributed to price increases, and German brands would probably have crept even more if not for economic downturn and loss of the marginal customer (one that puts your sales target over the guided targets).However, those cars also offer more, MUCH more for that money. More metal (not always a good thing, but at least in absolute terms - it is more), more features, better safety, better fuel economy WITH more power, etc. Some was mandated (tire pressure monitors, traction control systems, gas mileage improvements), some was market-driven (consumer electronics, size). I know some people would actually prefer 2003 325i over 2012 328i, but in all objective metrics, 2012 model is simply a better machine. Same goes for the named Toyotas, Audis and all the rest. If we factor those improvements, the prices are probably not as outrageously higher. The models tend to drift up in size and content over the years and create room for new line (3-series vs. 1-series), so after about three generations it is fair to start making those comparisons (both in term of price and content) with models from other shelf. I think in 10 years, ELLPS will include all those models dismissed today as ""not L enough"" or ""not P enough"" and current 3-series/C-class will be favorite ""family upscale sedans"". :surprise: "
"robr2","August 2012"," I agree about the reason for the price creep but I also see people adapting to that by lowering their standards when it comes to to their next car. To keep it simple, somebody who used to drive an Accord EX-L will drop down to an EX and then perhaps to an LX in the course of a few years as their income hasn't kept up with the price of automobiles - or anything else as well.I know someone who in the course of 5 cars and 15 years who has gone from a 300M to Lancer with a gradual step down over the years in order to keep the payment in his comfort zone.

"graphicguy","August 2012"," Is there a big gap between a $40K car vs a $50K car? I guess it depends on the car and the measuring stick. Is it Performance? Quality of build and/or materials used?

I would say it trumps a Mercedes C Class 4 matic, though. It has better tech and suspension than a G.The 3 Series is the measuring stick. If you get all the tech, with leather, nav, power, xDrive, etc. you're going to pay $50K. As hard as it is for me to say, the S4 trumps the 335i xDrive, too. So, to get that extra nth degree more of everything, you pay more.Having driven the TL SH AWD, the G and comparing them to the 335i and the S4, you can immediately see where the extra money went.It's up to the individual with the check book to decide if it's worth it.

"nyccarguy","August 2012"," Great point robr2. Like I said above, $50K is a pill I'm not prepared to swallow when my lease is up in 2 years.

It's a great driving car, power everything, cloth (unheated) seats, AC, no navigation... Yes I can afford an off lease $25K to $30K nicely equipped CPO ELLPS, but maybe I could also buy a Honda Fit (new, much cheaper) & pay it off in 3 years. That car & my wife's Pilot would be paid off around the same time & winds up being a HUGE chunk of money to put away every month. "
"fedlawman","August 2012"," Well, in my book, a $38,000 328i with leatherette seats and 17"" wheels is much easier to fathom than a $48,000 328i with Nav, Leather, and all the other frills.$10,000 is a lot to spend on stuff that adds little to the driving/ownership experience and will probably break in 5 or 6 years.

"dino001","August 2012"," The results are unverified, but assuming your research is right, it indeed is quite a spread, which flies into face of commodity inflation thesis. Obviously speaks into strategies of those companies pursue. There can be some one-time factors in play, or some shifting in target markets. As I remember, MB used to be most expensive, Audi least - it may be different now.BMW may also pursue somewhat different strategy in option vs base pricing. I noticed that the start from high forte, ridiculous prices at the beginning of the model life, but over time they tend to add things as no-cost or deeply discounted packages. For example, my 2012 wagon, last year of its line, had leather free already since 2011, there was additional discount on navigation with premium package ($500) and some of those phone integration electronics (bluetooth) were rolled in as no cost, as well. On the other hand, MB pretty much held its C-class options just the same for all that time. A friend of mine notices (he likes them much more than I) that MB-tex (vinyl surface) is actually dominant in stock, whereas almost no BMWs have leatherette on dealer's lots.

Back in '07, the panorama sunroof was standard on my wife's X3, but an option on my Dad's X5.My 2011 has the no cost Value Package that gave me standard heated seats, leather, 17"" wheels, & an iPod/USB ASAP. My slushbox was a no cost option too.Fedlawman - I agree with both your line of thinking as well as dino001's. My wife's former 2007 X3 had 4 options, Steptronic (nc), Montego blue metallic paint, heated front seats, Bluetooth, & rear privacy glass & we loved it.My 2011 328xi has leather, navigation,metallic paint, premium package, Xenon lights...I'd have to price a stripper out, but I still think it will be too rich for my blood. "
"robr2","August 2012"," ...there was additional discount on navigation with premium package ($500) and some of those phone integration electronics (bluetooth) were rolled in as no cost, as well. IMHO, this comes from the falling cost of electronics as a whole. "
"robr2","August 2012"," I'd have to price a stripper out, but I still think it will be too rich for my blood.It's $37,395 for a base 328i with leatherette and absolutely nothing else. 2.0, RWD, choice of manual or auto.I think the sales person at the dealership would scratch his head if you came in looking for that.One could:get the TSX with leather standard and the $1K manual option and save $5Korget the A4 with leather and Quattro and save $4Korget the C250 with auto and save $500or get the G25 with auto and leather and save $3Korget the IS250 with auto and leather and save $1500.Some folks might be happy with the base BMW setup as what I consider a driver's car and others may want a couple of other features and a few extra bucks in their pocket knowing they weren't going to be driving 9/10ths anyway. "
"dino001","August 2012"," Possibly, but the price went back up for 2012 sedan. They charge as much as they can, not as much as it costs. Old model, you get discount here and there, new one you pay up. "
"kyfdx","August 2012"," Our '03 BMW 325i sedan... with every option but NAV, more or less...stickered for $38,500..I think a comparable 2012 model would be under $46K (of course, you get a turbo-4, instead of a 6-cylinder).. "
"flightnurse","August 2012"," If this was true, then the price of the options for the MY 2012 would be the same price, but that wasn't the case.My 328i and all of the 328i for 2010 and 2011 came with the value package at no cost, leather (any color), Ipod connector. This made the Premium package costing $1750. I know for 2012 the Wagon and Coupe's had no charge leather too. With the price of these cars going up, some options should be standard. With the Wagon, sunroof is standard. Not too sure for 2013. "
"andys120","August 2012"," Thanks to a nationwide promotion to support the US Olympics Team, yesterday I got a short drive in one of BMW&#146;s new F30 3-Series cars. The invite didn&#146;t specify which model but I figured all they&#146;d have would be 328i models (X-Drive models aren&#146;t in showrooms yet) but I was given a choice and opted for the 335i (nearest equivalent to the &#146;01 330ci I own.).The car I got was a Melbourne Red 335i Sport Line four-door with the 8-speed autobox and a black leather interior. The car didn&#146;t have a Monroney sticker and I didn&#146;t ask the price but I figure it should sticker around $50K.Except for the color, I thought it was a really good-looking BMW. Although the hood has an odd shape in some photograph it looks fine in the metal. The current BMW reds lack the vibrancy of the old Imola Red and the black made the inside a bit dour IMO. I thought the othe cars on hand in gray or blue were more attractive. The interior was quite roomy for a 3er, pretty close to the size of my E39 Five Series.I thought the interior styling was too cluttered and I was a bit taken aback by the many options you had to sort thru for suspension, transmission and other settings. It would take at least a couple of weeks to learn all the settings and controls on this car.The prescribed test route was a short 8 mile circuit on some of the best maintained tertiary two-lanes in the NH Seacoast which is to say it wasn&#146;t much of a test of ride qualities but from what I could tell the car rode very smoothly, giving no hint of being on all-season run-flat tires of very low profiles. There&#146;s been a lot of concern about the lack of feel from the steering in the new (F10) Fivers. I&#146;m happy to report that the steering on the 335i is just as communicative as you would expect on a Bimmer. The transmission can be manually shifted readily and is well suited to a fast drive on back roads. Brakes and handling were excellent and the stop-start system was almost invisible. You can fell the restart but there&#146;s no unpleasant bump or shudder.Overall I think the F30 is an excellent all-round car that should be a very hard target for Cadillac, Audi or anyone else to surpass. I certainly would shop it but I do have some reservations. I&#146;ve never driven any car rated at 300HP but I assumed if I did it would be scary-fast. Don&#146;t get me wrong, the turbo-Bimmer is a fast car and will cover ground in a huge hurry but my old 5 liter Mustang (200HP) felt faster when you dropped the hammer to take off from a standstill but then the &#145;Stang was very light and had no traction control.I also thought the &#146;013 335i lacks the &#147;whee&#148; factor of my E46 Cabrio, it handles very well but just feels heavier and less tossable and less grippy than the old E46. "
"nyccarguy","August 2012"," robr2 - I just priced out a 2013 F30 328xi sedan and kept the options to a minimum (Standard Paint, Leatherette, no sunroof). Lighting Package, HK Stereo, & Heated Front Seats. MSRP is $41,670. I know it could be ordered if that's what I really want. What BMW brings to the table as far as the base model goes does impress me. There's also a part of me that thinks like dino001 and says: ""You really want a $42,000 BMW with so little options.""I had a TSX, liked it, ditched it after 2 1/2 years for my 2011 328xi. Acura's version of electric power steering wasn't for me.The A4 is a really nice vehicle, but Audi/VW long term durability scares me.The C250 seems like a nice car too. I haven't driven one, but right now MB only sells 4Matic C300's with a lackluster V6 instead of the cool, new Turbo 4.If I were to go with a G, it'd be ""go big or go home"" G37X. Xenon lights aren't available on the G25X either. I haven't read positive things about Nissan's small V6 as far as performance goes.I drove an IS250 AWD when it 1st came out in 2006. It had absolutely ZERO pickup. The 4cyl in my former TSX felt better by the seat of my pants. "
"robr2","August 2012"," Well my comparison was of ""entry level"" performance sedans. The $41K you priced out shows how the BMW is priced further into the stratosphere.Now everything you listed as cons on all the vehicles are totally subjective things.IMHO, the $36K for the 325i without the things you mentioned in my eyes just isn't a value. I mean $36K for leatherette, no fancy electronics, not heated seat, no premium pack just doesn't work for ME.If anything, I'd probably go for the A4 with leather and Quattro and put some of the saved $4K into better tires and suspension. I'm not afraid of Audi reliability as I've had a great experience with my VW.Besides you would probably lease - long term reliability shouldn't be a concern. "
"nyccarguy","August 2012"," I leased my 2011 328xi & while I LOVE IT, I'm going to buy (finance) my next purchase. "
"habitat1","August 2012"," I've been out of the car market (and off these forums) for a couple of years, but our recent decision to replace my wife's SUV brought me back. When we went to look at the MDX, the Acura dealer, seeing us arrive in my 2004 TL 6-speed, asked me if I wanted to test drive a new 2012 TL AWD 6-speed manual. I know all about BMW vs. Acura relative to driving dynamics and feel. (As evidence, we are paying $16k more for an X5D than the MDX would have cost). HOWEVER, if budget was an issue and I was lamenting ELLPS creeping towards and above the $50k price point, the current deals on the Acura TL's would be compelling to me.The dealer (Pohanka in VA) is currently offering $9,000 off on a TL-AWD Tech for a net price of $34,900. Was the TL as satisfying to drive as the RWD 335is Coupe that I drove when we were X5D shopping?? No, but I suspect it would be just as satisfying, if not more so than a 2013 328ix. And the price is compelling - a mere $25k less than 335is sticker As a side note, I referred a buddy to a BMW dealer in Baltimore that had a brand new 2011 535i 6-speed manual on their lot for 12 months. Sport package and lots of other options put the sticker at $59,000+. I told him to hand he dealer a check for $45,000 and dare him to rip it up. He got it for $45,500. "
"habitat1","August 2012"," Interesting to see your 10 year price comparisons showing 14%, 21% and 33% increases for MB, Audi and BMW respectively. I happen to have an old Kelly Blue Book that I pull out occasionally as a reminder of how crazy things were in the ""old days"". Here are some base price stats that show what the decade from 1985 to 1995 looked like by comparison:1985 Mercedes 190E - $23,7301995 Mercedes C220 - $32,000Increase = 34.9%1985 BMW 325e - $21,700.1995 BMW 325i - $34,120.Increase = 57.2%1985 Nissan Maxima SE - $13,6991995 Nissan Maxima SE - $22,989Increase = 67.8%1985 Honda Accord LX - $10,8241995 Honda Accord LX - $18,880Increase = 74.4%1985 Porsche 911 Coupe - $31,9501995 Porsche 911 Coupe - $63,055Increase 97.4%A few takeaways from this analysis:(1) It's pretty amazing how modestly prices have gone up in the 17 years since 1995. If they had continued to climb at the 1985-1995 pace, a BMW 328i would now have a base price of $73,600 and a 911 Coupe would be a mere $200,400. (2) Back in the ""old days"", even a bottom of the line BMW or Mercedes was a relatively rare symbol of status, costing over twice as much as a Honda Accord or 70% more than a ELLPS Maxima. When I bought a 1995 Maxima SE, the 325i was over 50% more. Today, the base price of a 328i is only $5,000 more than the base price of a 325i 17 years ago. And only a similar amount more than a Maxima.Draw your own conclusions as to what this means relative to ELLPS today. Frankly, I think a lot of people today are stretching to get themselves into a BMW, Audi or Mercedes when, back in 1985, or even 1995, they would have not even considered it and had to ""settle"" for a Honda Accord or maybe Nissan Maxima. I'm not so sure that was a bad thing. "
"dino001","August 2012"," I think your little study (thanks for it, BTW - informative). Only makes me wonder if cheaper cars (subcompacts went up even more). I blame our government that knows better what's good for the people (airbags, stability control, ABS, emissions, fuel economy, the list goes on). As always defenders of the people end up hurting them much more - they always throw in arguments that it is only ""a little more"", but over time it those very people who pay for it through their noses. It seems that it is bottom car prices that came closer to luxury cars - as they were galloping up, the luxury cars were dribbling, as those mandatory features were there anyway and smaller price differential created more incentive for people to reach, even if stretched. "
"nyccarguy","August 2012"," Hey habitat1. Good to see you back on the forum here. Saw on another thread that you no longer have your beloved 911 C2 Cab. My automotive condolences to you. I've never driven a TL SH-AWD, but know its got some chops from what I've read. What'd you think of the brakes compared to the BMW? I don't track or race my car, just looking for a little fun on my 6 day/week commute like I did with my 2001 Prelude Type SH for the 1st 9 years of its life. I wasn't ""getting it"" from the 2010 TSX I inherited from my wife (lifeless electric power steering, crummy brakes). I love my 2011 328xi. I just don't know if the new F30 328xi will be worth it so sparsely equipped as I ""built"" last night. Especially when a TL SH-AWD Tech comes loaded for a similar sticker. I've still got 2 years of research to decide about my next purchase. "
"habitat1","August 2012"," You make a good point. Adding incremental costs for safety requirements will increase the cost of lower price cars by a higher percentage than expensive cars. But I still think the biggest difference over the past 2-3 decades in what we now label the ELPPS segment is that BMW and Mercedes are now considered ""affordable"" by a much larger percentage of the population because of their conscious decision to employ a product mix and pricing strategy that competes for this market. Perhaps partly in response or retaliation for Lexus, Infiniti and Acura moving into their previously unchallenged luxury territory.Anecdotal example: Back in about 1969, I had a friend whose aunt drove a new Mercedes. She would pick us up from grade school 2-3 days a week. People used to stop and stare at the car - and be even more shocked when they saw a woman driving it. At one point, she was interviewed by the local newspaper and asked how it felt to be the only verified single female that owned a Mercedes in a city of 100,000. She worked for Navy Intelligence, spent a lot of time in Europe and got the Mercedes through a diplomatic/military purchase program at a huge discount, or so she said. Today, I'd make a bet that if I drove 15 miles to the nearest Wal Mart, I'd find at least a dozen Mercedes and BMW's in the lot. Hell, I think you can buy a Mercedes at Costco. "
"habitat1","August 2012"," Thanks, but no condolences needed. I had a good 5 1/2 years and 30k miles with the 911 and my daughters couldn't fit in the back seat anymore. But if the bank account recovers in time from our upcoming X5 Diesel purchase, I could possibly see a new Cayman in my garage sometime next spring.Regarding the TL vs. BMW, my own 2004 TL 6-speed has Brembo brakes standard. I believe the 2012 TL SH-AWD 6-speed manual does as well. In my car, they are great, and way, way better than the crappy brakes on our MDX or the automatic TL's I was given as service loaners. My 2004 is FWD, so it has all of those performance pitfalls, but is still a reasonably fun car.I would never seriously consider or recommend an automatic or FWD TL over a BMW. The 6-speed manual TL-SHAWD might be worth a test drive for you to make the call yourself. Interestingly, I was NOT very favorably impressed with 2011/2012 535i 6-speed manuals. I wasn't seriously in the market, but when we were shopping for the X5, was being tempted by some great deals. But after a few test drives, I concluded that the new 5 series felt heavy and a bit dull compared to the older models or the (outgoing) 3 series. "
"m6user","August 2012"," The general inflation rate will of course affect any price increases in addition to governmental regualtions. I believe the period you mentioned, 1985 to 1995 has substantially more inflation than the period I tracked, 2002/3 to 2012/13.Mortgage rates were in the 9-10% range back in the late eighties. I remember refinancing in 1992 to 7.5%, down from 9.5%. If you consider the ""hyper"" inflation of the late 70s and early 80s(I can actually remember getting pay raises of over 10% several of those years) car prices may have been catching up somewhat. I believe they lag inflation by a couple of years as manufactures try to hold the line on prices until profit pressures become too great to resist. "
"dino001","August 2012"," This is good story. However, in 1969 Mercedes was only making cars that were market positioned equivalent of today's S-class and top of E-class. Model 190 (predecessor of C-class) was introduces somewhere in late 70s or early 80s, don't know exact dates. The ELLPS simply did not exist back then. There was a small BMW and Europe has always had cars like those, but the concept was pretty much unknown in the US. So the bridge was gapped from both sides (cheap cars becoming not so cheap and expensive brands introducing less expensive models) "
"habitat1","August 2012"," You are exactly right - and that's the essence of my point. An ELLPS segment that has BMW and Mercedes competing against Japanese and even American cars for the same buyer didn't really exist until about 1995 or later. Prior to that, it was easy. We all knew our place in car society. And now Hyundai is on TV with ads comparing their Genesis to a Panamera S?? Holy cow. "

Gorgeous black on black with all the right options and none of the dumb ones. Was willing to discount it to under $50k. My wife drove it and I almost had to pry her out with a crowbar. She was rowing those gears like it was a (slow) 911. But it was just a bit too small and I really didn't want to pay Porsche service costs for a vehicle that will likely be keeping for 8+ years and 120k+ miles. We ordered an X5d. "

After an '05 530i & an '08 328xi, I was almost certain my Mom was going to go for an X5. She drove the X5 & liked it a lot, but then drove a Cayenne & fell in love. You definitely made the smart choice going with the X5 diesel. There's A LOT to be said for BMW's no cost maintenance. Every time I spend a significant amount of time driving my wife's 2011 Pilot, I tell myself that it's comfortable & has adequate power. I drive my Prelude and enjoy the car's simplicity. I say to myself that I don't NEED a BMW (or BMW payment) as my commuter sled. Then I push my 328xi's start button and listen to the I6 purr to life. I love how the engine's power doesn't seem to peak, the perfectly weighted steering, the car's agility & balance, how it seems to cruise effortlessly at high speeds... "

"habitat1","August 2012"," Interesting review by C-Net and seems to confirm my sense that BMW may be losing its way with the new 3-series.My sense is that the new 3, being a little bigger, a little softer and a little more expensive, is creeping more and more into the ""tweener"" role that the 5-series used to play between the enthusiast 3 and executive 7. Especially when I look at dealer's websites and see almost nothing but automatic transmissions. At the present time, the largest Acura dealer in my area has 3 TL 6-speed manuals in stock and the largest BMW dealer has 0 (that's ZERO) 3-series with a stick in stock. What's next, cats sleeping with dogs??Even the C-Net reviewer slipped into a bit of bipolarism when he longed for a manual transmission to better match the great engine, yet commented that a $50k+ car shouldn't have as much road noise and feedback.It appears that the 135i is now BMW's enthusiast car. I was initially shocked when a golfing buddy showed up to our last outing this June driving a new 135i convertible. It was his ""graduation present"" for getting his last kid through college. I asked how he fit into that little ""toy"". He quickly pointed out that it has the same front seat interior room as his old 1987 M6, is considerably faster and better handling, and cost about the same amount.....25 years later. Not that price mattered - he owns/flys his own turboprop - but he bought the 135 for its virtues, which sounded a lot like why people used to buy the 3 series: DRIVING enjoyment. So is the 3-series gradually evolving into less of the driving enthusiast's choice and more of a ""mini-5""? "

"fedlawman","August 2012"," I think everything evolves in cycles. For a while (2004 through 2006), Acura was arguably #2 in this segment under BMW. Audi was overshadowed by BMW, Infiniti was showing promise as a Japanese BMW alternative, and M-B wasn't an enthusiasts choice. Cadillac was showing promise and Lexus was failing as a Japanese BMW alternative.Today, Audi is tops and Infiniti is arguable #2 being the best bang-for-the-buck choice in the segment. BMW and Acura have both lost their way (though the Roundel still has clout the cars don't deserve right now). Mercedes has improved quality and handling dynamics, and Cadillac has gained credibility with the Gen2 CTS (and the ATS is looking like a real player). Lexus remains content to do the same old thing and sell a ton of ES and RX 350's.6 years from now, I'm sure the picture will be completely different again. "

"flightnurse","August 2012"," Bradd the 6 series is not really a sports car, it is really a grand touring, which is not a bad thing really.The new 5 series is OK, as I stated, if I was to get a 5 series it would be a 550i with the M sport package, which really makes it a M5 light. Yes, driving one is a lesson in control, as it is easy to drive it fast without knowing it.The 1 series will become the 2 series starting in 2014 and BMW will be bring out a series of cars sort of like the Audi ""S"" cars, I have read that in 2014 the 235i will have a M performance package, sort of like what BMW did with the 3 series with the ZHP package. This is why it is hard for me to get sell my 330i, it was/is a true drivers car, something that the current 3 series is not. The M235i will get the 315hp turbo six, which would make me want to sell my 330i, it will be a drivers car. This is something that Infiniti hasn't done with the G, its not a drivers car. The M235i will be less then what i paid for my 330i and give me more performance, so it is a win win... "
"flightnurse","August 2012"," Bill you looking at a new 550 or used ? The current 550i is by far the best 5 series one can by, the Single turbo 6 in the 535 doesn't have the feel that the twin turbo 6 had, doesn't feel as sporty. The 550 is a fright train, I would take the 550 over the M5 any day. "
"habitat1","August 2012"," Fedlawman - what's your basis for saying Audi is #1 and Infiniti is #2 in this segment?Audi makes some very nice cars, but for all of the accolades the A6 gets, I don't think of it as an enthusiasts choice. No manual transmission, very heavy, an AWD system that is FWD biased, etc. It performs quite well, in spite of all of that, but I still can't think of it as a true drivers car. And in the performance line of the S4, S5, S6 cars, I would still never put them in the enthusiast's league of the M3 or M5. More like AMG-lite.If you are saying that Audi is #1 because they are the closest to ""all things for all people"", I'd probably agree. But they don't get my own blood boiling to dump my Acura TL and buy one tomorrow. On another matter, I think BMW needs to steal some Porsche engineers and put their vehicles on a big diet. The 550i weighs damn near the same as a Porsche Cayenne SUV. Which, by the way, dropped 400 lbs in its redesign and the new 911 and Boxster have also lost a few pounds in the Porsche spa. Not sure why BMW, ""the ultimate driving machine"" has been so slow to use more aluminum and charge its engineers to do more with less (weight). "

Mid-life crisis...  "
"markcincinnati","August 2012"," The Audi A6 quattro on day one was not FWD biased. It was a 50% 50% set up with a non-reactionary TorSen system. Torque was able to be shifted instantly F or R -ward based on circumstances. The non-reactionary system was unique (probably still is since most of the market doesn't use TorSen) since it was said to ""act in real time."" All other systems ""react"" which means there is a slight delay in the transfer of power to the end where it will do the most good.For years the Audi A6 quattro has been REAR WHEEL biased, but still uses a non-reactionary system. The TT, on the other hand, did not start out with the TorSen system, rather it started out with the Haldex system (not that there is anything wrong with that), but it is FWD biased and it is a reactionary system, meaning there is some lag whilst the thing figures out there is a need for power at the opposite end and then shifts power appropriately.The A6, since that is where we started, also can be equipped with a system that is called the sport differential, but you can call it a Torque Vectoring system and you'd be right. Acura's system is SH-AWD but it is, currently, implemented in its cars with SEVERE FWD bias (95%), and it, too, is reactionary. Those of you who have the 6-speed auto 305HP V6 TL SH-AWD can attest to the lag time in these reactionary systems by simply putting the transmission in drive and flooring the accelerator. For an instant (which seems like a second) the steering wheel twitches in your grip while the reaction time passes and the FWD power is shifted aft.Try an Audi S4 or even an A4 -- both, like the A6, with Rear Biased AWD -- floor them -- there is zero torque steer, since the thing is 60% RWD biased and doesn't have to react, since TorSen differentials ""bind in real time.""The new Audi A6 chassis, while still NOSE HEAVY, are much better with respect to weight distribution than they have ever been and somehow Audi has -- perhaps only for a brief 15 minutes of fame, so to speak -- managed to jump to the top of the heap insofar as performance is concerned. And, despite its high price tag, the new S6 is a price performer when compared to both BMW and Mercedes models that can keep up with it. Yep, Audis have cranked up their prices -- but, if there is such a thing as bang for the buck in the over $60,000 crowd, today that accolade would be earned only by Audi.I still remember my buddy who purchased a new 530 (RWD only) with a Premium Pack option, period. This was, admittedly 2002. My Audi A6 was a quattro with the sport package, premium wheels, nav and everything you could get on an A6, including premium paint -- oh yea, and it came with a 4.2L V8. My Audi was about $2K less. To even approximate the content (but not the engine) would have put the 530's msrp into orbit.Where was I? Oh, yea -- A6 quattros have never been fwd biased, and for several years now they have been rwd biased, but with non-reactionary awd (which, admittedly, makes them a bit heavier than the other ELLPS and LPS offerings from Asia, Europe and the US.) :P "

"fedlawman","August 2012"," I am referring strictly to the ELLPS segment - the Audi A4. The A6, M cars, etc. are not ELLPS's.An A4 Quattro with 6-speed manual starts at $35K. It's a better car than the 328i. It's also the sexiest looking car in this segment (inside and out) with the best combination of performance, elegance, and refinement.IMO of course...  "

"nyccarguy","August 2012"," You must have me mistaken for someone who doesn't have 27 years & 11 months until his mortgage is paid off, doesn't have to redo his kitchen (because the 1985 Formica cabinets are literally falling apart), figure out how he's going to send 3 kids (6, 3 1/2, & 8 months)... Lol!Sorry if my post was misleading. I test drove the car at one of BMWUSA's drive for team USA last year. I drove the 650i convertible on a hot summer day. I know it's a grand tourer & not a true sports car, but c'mon. It's a sport package equipped BMW, not an MB SL550. "
"habitat1","August 2012"," I respect your opinion, but not sure I would agree with it. The A4, as with the TL, requires that you go with AWD to avoid their standard FWD setup. That's OK if you are comparing to a 328ix, but if the ""P"" in ELLPS is important, I still prefer the driving feel and dynamics of a 50/50 balanced RWD sedan. And, if you really want AWD and can get by the exterior looks of the TL, it appears to offer significantly better performance than the A4 Quattro. Personally, I don't find Audi's exterior design on the A4 to be that much better than the TL. The A5 is seriously great looking, the A7 very good, but the A4/A6 still look slab sided and plain/boxy in my opinion. When I think ""sexy"", the A5 qualifies, but the A4 needs a lot of work. Even the C-class sedans beat the A4 for exterior looks, IMO.Disclosure: I haven't driven a new A4 Quattro 6-speed manual. I am basing performance comparison on what is published and my limited experience with an automatic as a loaner. But giving up nearly 100hp to the TL and Acura's AWD system (perhaps) being more advanced from a handling perspective, leads me to believe that the A4 would not do well in a track test between the two. And maybe not against a 328i RWD. But.....sexy is an ""O"", so I do respect your ""IMO"". "
"habitat1","August 2012"," OK, I guess a 911 will have to stand in line behind granite countertops, 529 accounts and a few other priorities. But hang in there, enjoy your kids (they grow up too fast) and let me tempt you again in 2040. "
"fedlawman","August 2012"," I agree the TL has the better powertrain, but a 6MT costs $44K, and for that much money, there are better choices IMO (S4?).And the interior and exterior styling of the Audi is far better (again IMO). Better control layout and material quality in the Audi, and the Audi just goes down the road better (quieter cabin with classic German suspension tuning). It's the only $35k car here that makes you feel like you spent $45k when you're driving it.The AWD TL is the best car Acura sells right now and I agree it's still a contender (I like it better than the G37). But I have to bump Acura down a notch from 6 years ago because as a whole, their lineup isn't very compelling. "
"flightnurse","August 2012"," In regards to the 550i, yes it is heavy, however, the 550i still does 0-60 in 5 sec, pretty darn quick for a heavy sedan, and with M sport Package handles very well too. Much better then MB E550 (which one comes in all wheel drive.) "
"flightnurse","August 2012"," Not in my book, three turbo's, talk about one hot engine compartment. I read that BMW was looking to bring over a V8 twin turbo oiler that made the same amount of power, which was faster and better MPH. Heck, I would be happy if they just dropped the X5 oiler in the 5 series and turned up the boost some. "
"flightnurse","August 2012"," NYC, just because it has a sport package doesn't make it is a sport's car. Just as the MB SL doesn't live up to its name, SL means ""superleicht"" Super Light, however we all know that over the years that wasn't true for that model. "

"habitat1","August 2012"," In my area, the ""real world"" price on a 2012 A4 and TL 6MT would be within a few dollars. An A4 with navigation and premium package is $41k, Invoice $38.2k. Add $2,500+/- to those numbers if you go with a Prestige package. The TL 6MT is can be bought for about $35-36k ($8-9k off MSRP) right now, from Pohanka Acura, with 3 in stock. So, if anything, a comparably equipped A4 Quattro might be a little more expensive than the TL. Prices may vary where you are at. Aesthetic preferences are very subjective, and I respect yours. If the A4 had more of the look of the A5, I'd be more excited. Not sure how they would do that - maybe reshape it into an A7-lite and flair the sides a bit. As for going down the road better, I'll hold off on that until if and when I get behind the wheel. The 2010+/- A4 automatic I had as a service loaner was certainly not as you describe in quietness and luxury feel, but that was a couple of years ago and it may have been beaten up a bit. "

"
"fedlawman","August 2012"," I respect your opinions as much as anyone here and I admit your points about the TL are valid. Street pricing vs. MSRP, while a legitimate point, always complicates the discussion so I tend to avoid bringing it up.And yes, the A4 styling pales in comparison to the A5, which is drop dead gorgeous, but it appears to me as the most fluid and least contrived of the segment. Of course, there's just so much you can do with a 4-door 3-box design without sacrificing interior space/comfort.I admit it's been a while since I've driven the TL, so maybe I need to refresh my memory? I remember it being a very nice car, but like all Honda's, a little less isolated in cabin noise vs. the competition. "
"habitat1","August 2012"," I am a BMW fan, as evidenced by our imminent pick up of an X5d in early September at the Performance Delivery Center in Spartanburg. And the 550i is a very nice car in many respects. But it could - and should - be better yet.The 550i 6MT weighs 4,350+ lbs, goes 0-60 in about 5.0 and gets 15/22 MPG. The CLS550 is 200 lbs lighter, goes 0-60 in 4.4 and is rated 17/25 MPG. The E55 AWD is another 115 lbs less than the CLS.When I was vaguely contemplating an M5 in 2002, it weighed 4,000 lbs and with a high revving 400hp/369 ft.lb engine, was a few tenths quicker than the current 550i in spite of giving up 80 ft lbs of torque. Forget the handling comparison, the old M5 was much more precise, nimble and tossable than the current 550. In the ELLPS, we have seen pretty steady improvements in performance, at not a huge increase in price. I would expect BMW to have maintained it's dominance with the 550i, but in my opinion, has been slow to put it on a diet and keep it positioned as the clear enthusiast's choice over some of the LPS competition. At least they do still offer a 6-speed manual. And maybe the added 40 hp in the performance package for 2013 will help. But I'd like to see it tip the scales at 3,950. That's still a half ton more than my beloved 1995 Maxima and only 400 lbs less than a Cayenne SUV. Come on, BMW, start doing those push ups and get rid of the flab. "
"flightnurse","August 2012"," when you say sharpness, explain. _I_ feel that the people might expect more out of the 6 series then what BMW was intending the 6 series to be. Now I can tell you the 1st Gen 6 series had more sporty feel then the current one. Haven't driven the 4 dr 6 series yet, which I'm thinking wont be all that sporty but still competent when pushed, more so then the MB SL.  "
"flightnurse","August 2012","  I remember it being a very nice car, but like all Honda's, a little less isolated in cabin noise vs. the competition.Hey Fed, for me most  Honda products are like appliances, they do what they are suppose to and don't leave a last impression. On my last trip arrived into Charotte NC late, got to rental car agency and had a problem, not many cars to choose from, had a couple of Chrysler 200s (no thanks), 2 Altima's, a Camry and an Accord. I had my choice of Tahoe or transverse. I took the Accord (its been a while since I have driven one) it was an EX. Nothing stood out for me, the driving position, the steering feel, the brakes, the handling. When one talks about the TL, I hear people talk about the top of the line model, not the entry level or mid level. The last time I drove a TL was back in 2008 and it was a Type S, nice car, very comfortable seats, but again, not else stood out. "
"stickguy","August 2012"," I would go with features. I rarely would get to use any of the extra performance, and after driving relatively small engine cars, even a small motor (say, the Infiniti G25) is going to be fast!so I would give up some motor (your car vs. a 335 say) to get the goodies like moonroof, fancier seats, etx. "
"markcincinnati","August 2012"," While I agree that for the price of a TL SH-AWD Advance you could get a BASE Audi S4, the S4 requires over $11,000 of options to get to parity with respect to ""content."" The TL SH-AWD Advance with the a la carte addition of back-up sensors and splash gaurds is north of $47 or $48K depending on how many a la carte do-dads (which are nice) you check off.The TL SH-AWD, however, is able to (mostly) keep up with the S4 (you've no doubt read the test report comparing the two cars, which shows them to have remarkably similar performance -- even though the Audi, in the end, does out-perform the Acura -- for $11,000+ more outlay.)I call the TL SH-AWD Advance, an S4 ""lite"" or perhaps S4-like. Given a price independant choice, I would still, however, take the S4 without any hesitation. I like the [Acura's] 19"" wheels, blind spot warning, the ventilated seats, the best factory sound system ever and the torque vectoring, etc, etc, etc, all of which jack the cost of an S4 way too close to $60,000.I went to Acura from a nearly $49K 2009 Audi A4 2.0T Prestige quattro sport -- the last in a long, long line of Audi products (which I dearly loved.) I wanted the performance of the Audi and the content of the Acura -- for UNDER $50K. The Acura is outgunned by the S4 (and yet the TL is NOT shamed by the S4), but [the TL Sh-AWD Advance] is priced like an Audi A4 Premium+ with a couple of options on it. And the Acura is ""similar"" in performance to the S4, which I would argue is at the top o' the heap of the desirable car list (that can be afforded by mere mortals.) The TL is ugly, a step up from fugly, but a far cry from the beautiful A4 (IMHO). But once you're behind the wheel of the TL at, ahem, ""highway"" speeds  listening to a great DVD-Audio disk, you quickly forget how the face and butt of the TL look.Today, the TL remains an interesting proposition -- perhaps when Acura ""rationalizes"" the entire lineup, improves the styling and so forth, Acura will regain legitimacy in the Premium class. I await 2014 for some sign from above that they have once again found their way.My hopes are high, but likewise are my doubts that they [Acura] will once again be a legitimate player in the ELLPS and LPS sandbox. The new RDX and ILX indicate they think they can get away with producing ""Honda's who know someone"" rather than real Premium cars. And, you know what? If they sell enough of them, it doesn't matter one whit what any of us thinks. With Acura we're kind of at the same place we were (or are) with respect to manual transmissions -- no matter how we cry and whine (here on these boards), manual transmissions are virtually dead because ""no one"" buys them and it costs a lot to get a car certified for sale here in the US -- so why bother when the customer take up on stick shifts which used to be at 3% continues to fall and fall and fall into the abyss. We have voted with our dollars -- and here we are. :surprise: Drive it like you live. "
"markcincinnati","August 2012"," Oh, almost forgot. I drove a TL in the $35K price range -- it was almost as bad as a Lexus ES (a Barco Lounger on wheels). The TL that truly feels like an ELLPS is the TL SH-AWD Advance (by a moderate margin, I'd venture.)Even the Tech version seems tinny, flimsy and not worthy -- of anything but the comment, ""nice Honda."" :confuse: The top of the line must have some secret sauce, a ""sport tuned"" suspension perhaps(?) -- I had never driven any TL other than a TL SH-AWD Advance until 2 weeks ago. What a disappointment to drive the lesser vehicle. It wallowed (like a pig) and seemed to be soft and squishy, able to overpower its poor tires and wheels even on a cloverleaf exit ramp. Damn near made me say ""who screwed up this car, is this a joke?"" "

"habitat1","August 2012"," I'm not sure what to make of your TL AWD ""Advance"" accolades. All the ""Advance"" is, is a Tech with a few extra gadgets. Period. No chassis, brakes or other mechanical differences whatsoever. The Advance comes standard with 19"" ""all season"" performance tires, whereas the TL 6MT can be ordered with either all season or summer performance tires. None of which are as good as you can do from Tire Rack when you replace them. My 2004 TL 6MT had a number of addiitonal performance features that none of the automatic models offered at the time: Brembo brakes, larger diameter stabilizer bars, ""sport tuned"" suspension, summer W-rated performance tires. But for the current 2012 model, Acura bagged the Brembo brakes completely (bad move) and made the suspensions equal across all AWD models regardless of base, Tech, Advance or 6MT. What the TL SH-AWD 6MT offers is arguably one of the better close ratio short throw six speeds to be found in an ELLPS and a not insignificant 110 - 145 pound weight savings over the Tech and Advance automatics. To me, the driving difference between a 6MT and any of the automatic TL's is significant - with much more responsive acceleration and fun to drive factor. If you found there to be a difference between driving a Tech and an Advance in automatic form, I can't imagine where it's coming from. Possibly those ventilated seats, but not the engine, suspension, brakes or anything else that matters. "
"fedlawman","August 2012"," I agree the TL SH-AWD is a terrific car, and with discounts is also a good buy. My comments about Acura really sum up my overall disappointment with the downward spiral of their entire lineup.In 2004 they had the RSX which, while arguably not deserving of the Acura badge, was a terrific sports car (especially in ""S"" trim). Then there was the first gen TSX 6MT. It's ride, handling styling, driveline, etc. had such a synergy that, for me, made it an even match for the BMW 3-series. And the TL in 2004 was lean and mean, with good looks, powerful driveline, and sharp reflexes.Today, the only Acura worth a second glance is the TL SH-AWD. And even their best has polarizing looks (I'm being polite  ) and an unattractive cockpit with too many buttons (my opinion).For me, even with a bottom-of-the-line A4, you get a handsome, elegant sedan that does no wrong. Now I'll admit that I'm not a bells and whistles kind of guy, so i don't care if my car has back up cameras, Nav, and surround audio. Hell, I even prefer cloth and pleather to genuine cowhide!Oh well, I'm just one enthusiast with admittedly unconventional tastes. And I've admitted before that I became alienated from this segment several years ago when I discovered the joys of E30's.Thank you and Habitat for setting the record straight on the SH-AWD - I did do it a disservice by not mentioning it in my initial comment.

That kind of blows the 1 in 6305 out of the water for 2012. I've been told that manual transmissions on the TL this year are running about 3%, which would make it 33 to 1. Or 190 to 6305.It is a shame in my opinion. The TL manual gets an 8.5 out of 10 on my scale for crisp feel, short throw.

Beautiful black on back one at Auto Palace in Pittsburgh. If it wasn't for the fact that it's just a hair too small inside and I didn't really want to pay Porsche service costs for the next 10 years and 150k miles, we would have gone for it.

I was exactly in that mind-set until I drove the two cars back to back one long afternoon of test driving in June or July, 2011.There is no way the S4 is NOT more satisfying and overall believable as a performance car. Nevertheless, the TL SH-AWD with the 19"" wheels, driven exactly over the same test drive route and the same speeds (up to 90mph) feels somewhat like a diluted S4. The S4 is the better machine, there is no argument from me on that point. Where I found myself able to rationalize and accept the TL (after 29 Audis in a row) was when I contented the two similarly and found the Audi required an MSRP bump in excess of $11,000. I live in Cincinnati, a small city or a big town, replete with at least twice-daily traffic clogs on our three Interstates. The chances, my chances, that is, of being able to ever tap the potential of the S4 continue to erode -- although there remain a few chances to make forward progress at speeds in excess of 65MPH. The S4 does rip through the TL's performance envelope, but the TL SH-AWD with the 19"" wheel and tire upgrade rips through most other car's performance envelopes -- but even then, there is a decreasing window of opportunity to use its performance.I have not been drinking any Kool-aid -- I am not suggesting you should succumb to the price differential if you are willing and able to pay the price for an S4 Prestige with several options that crank its price up over 5 figures more than the TL.What I am suggesting, or asking, is that you do test drive a TL SH-AWD advance or TL SH-AWD tech with the upgraded wheels and tires and with the super slick 6-speed stick.It is difficult to learn to love, let alone like, the TL's nose and butt, and the interior has ""too much Honda"" in it -- but damn, the TL SH-AWD Advance can be loaded up with options and leased for less than $550 per month for 36 months. If you have not driven this car equipped thusly, I believe you will be impressed.I do not believe you will think you are driving an S4, I believe you may think of the TL SH-AWD Advance as a ""second cousin, twice removed,"" however. :shades: "

"habitat1","August 2012"," O.K., I think I figured it out.The ""take rate"" of 5% for the TL means that 5% of all TL's in 2010 were manual transmissions. The 1 in 6305 odds of being sold means that of ALL cars sold in the US in 2010, 1 in 6,305 was a manual TL.Test: The ""take rate"" on the Camry was 3%, but the odds were 1 in 1237. Which if you do the math backwards, implies that there were about 8.5 times as many Camry's sold in the US than TL's. According to the site listed below, total TL sales were 34,039 in 2010 and total Camry sales were 327,804. That's 9.5 times as many, but given Motor Trend rounded the ""take rate"" to the nearest percent, is within the rounding error. sales by modelLooking at it another way, total car sales in the US were 11,371,674 in 2010. Odds of one of those cars being a manual TL, 1 in 6305 = 1,804 total. Odds of one of those being a manual Camry, 1 in 1,237 = 9,193 total. Odds of one of those being a manual Cayenne, 1 in 37,361 = 304 total. P.S. I personally test drove 1.3% of all manual Cayennes made in 2010 (1 GTS and 3 V6's).

Toyota has been doing this for years, having regional cars, now not too sure why one could not buy a SE with a stick nationwide.If you type in 28201 (Charlotte,NC) you can build yourself a Tiguan with 6 spd just as you stated, however, when type 85006, no 6 spd manual.

"nyccarguy","August 2012"," That's what I'm thinking stick. My current 328xi (with it's 230 hp) is no rocket, but definitely fast enough.Like I said before, I may not like the way the new F30 328xi (2.0 T 4cyl, electric power steering) drives nor will I want to part with the better part of $50K to get one. So if I do stick with an ELLPS, I'll probably end up with what I LOVE.If a BMW 335i w/o NAV were to pop up for sale around the time my lease is up, it might be worth a look. I rarely use the NAV & would easily give it up for a Sport Pkg car. Those Sport Seats are PERFECT for my 5'10"" 150# frame:)EDIT: I see the link from BMWUSA's site doesn't work.

"habitat1","August 2012"," I guess I expect all BMWs to drive kinda like my 328xi does.Forget it, at least until BMW goes on a serious weight loss program. I know vehicle weight isn't the only factor, but how can you have a ""nimble feel"" when a car like the 650ic weighs over 4,500 lbs. Here are some weights from ultra fit to morbidly obese. Any surprise that the order represents how nimble the vehicles feelBoxster: 2,888 lbsBoxster S: 2,910 lbs911 C2: 3,042 lbs 911 S Cab: 3,318 lbs Z4: 3,549Panamera: 3,880SL550: 3,935 (2012 model was 4,200)640i: 4,192Cayenne V6: 4,398650iC: 4,531I know the list ranges from sports cars to SUV's, but in almost every case BMW has ballooned up in weight more than most of its competition. Audi was previously the fatso with many of their cars, but BMW is giving them a waddle for their money. And not that shaving 265 lbs off the SL was much more than kicking a deck chair off the Queen Mary, but at least Mercedes is trying to go in the right direction. The fact that the E class is now leaner than the 5 series is, IMO, embarrassing to BMW.  "
"graphicguy","August 2012"," Mark....I certainly understand what you're saying. I do like the current TL SH AWD. I even like the styling (pre-nose surgery). But, I think you and I are probably in the minority.I saw the announcement for the new RL. Looks quite interesting. Also will be interesting what will happen with the TL, given the new update to the Accord. Seeing pics, and seeing reading the ""updates"", I'm not so certain that it will be a revolutionary update vs an evolutionary one. I do think the TL is going to need a revolutionary one. Then again, much of it's competition is pretty long-in-the-tooth, too. The ES/IS certainly hasn't been revolutionary, neither has the G (although it looks like it's due for an update based on the new Altima).Since you know the Cincinnati area like I do, I took the GF's S4 to Amish Country a couple of weeks ago. It's a great drive, over some great roads. As most know, the S4 has a DSG dual clutch trans. Frankly, it simply outperformed any manual trans I've ever driven....and I've driven a lot of them....some good, some bad. This trans trumped all of them, regardless what measurement you use.It downshifts at precisely the moment it needs to (does the same for upshifting, and also double clutches precisely when it needs to. In addition, it snaps of shifts way faster than I ever thought I could. It magically seems to know what gear to be in, too.NYC.....my 335i's trans is close in performance, but not quite what the S4 trans can do.If I can get that kind of performance out of auto/manual transmissions, I won't need a manual. "
"habitat1","August 2012"," If I can get that kind of performance out of auto/manual transmissions, I won't need a manual.I'm going to go out on a limb here and suggest that no one in this forum NEEDS a manual or a DSG. If I have offended any Formula One drivers, my apologies. I've driven the new 911S with PDK transmission. According to the experts (the real ones, not me) it's crisper, faster and better than any other dual clutch auto manual made, including Ferraris latest and greatest. But it just doesn't give me that same sense of involvement and satisfaction. That's really what it's all about for me. And, I suspect, most others that prefer a three pedal manual transmission. Analogy: When I golf, I like to play the course from the tips (7,000+ yard back tees). I know it's likely to add 2-3+ strokes to my score over 18 holes, but I get more enjoyment playing the entire course than cut out 500+ yards so I can pat myself on the back for a slightly better score. There are some cars - the TL especially - in which the manual is clearly better than a traditional slushbox automatic in performance, objectively and subjectively. But there are other cars - the S4 and 911 to name two - in which the transmission choice merely represents a personal ""engagement"" preference. Agree? "

So I looked at the dealer website inventories for the zip codes that were in the region that the Toyota website allowed you to pick a manual Camry, and sure enough, some dealers had them on the lot, although not many.Bottom line is you could get one any where in the country, although in some regions, your dealer would have to order it.

"fedlawman","August 2012"," Well the crash tests are very specific so the manufacturers can (and do) design the cars to pass the tests - regardless of whether it adds to the overall safety of passengers or not. I'm not super familiar with Euro NCAP standards, but I've heard they are different (offset impacts, pedestrian protection, etc.). Perhaps the Euro standards are at odds with some US standards so the Germans have to decide which test they want to design the car for? "

"nyccarguy","August 2012"," These crash tests do change ALL THE TIME. Just because the car I'm looking at didn't do well in the latest ""test"" wouldn't detract me from buying it.

Still, the fact remains the test applies to all equally and that these ratings do not go from absolutely safe to death trap as there are gradations and even the lowest rating would not be classified as inherently unsafe.

"jeffm5","August 2012"," I've had the S60 for 3 weeks and I'm very happy with my choice. I test drove a LaCrosse, VW CC, Tauras, Azera. I've always been impressed with the ES 350, but there are so many of them here in Western PA. I wanted something different.Before I give my impressions of the S60 there a couple things you need to know. I was coming out of a 2005 Avalon Limited, which was a great car. This is a loaded 2013 and is my first ""luxury/near luxury car."" The front seat comfort for both the passenger and driver are outstanding. All of the controls are on the steering wheel or within easy reach. Handling is outstanding, power and acceleration are very good (this is my first turbo). Visibility is very good. The car has a solid feel. No rattles. The ride is a little choppy on rough roads, very good otherwise. I'm getting 30+ on the highway at about 65 mph and around 24 in mixed driving on regular.The phone, radio, NAV, etc. are accessed through the Volvo Sensus system, which works fine once you get past the learning curve. Our cell phones, iTouch work fine. The Sensus/NAV screen is not a touch screen. It's 7 inches. I wish it was a little larger. The tach. and speedometer are not backlit. The interior has that orderly understated look, but, not surprisingly, lacks ""bling"". Sensus is voice activated and works very well.I got all of the safety features, all of which seem to work as advertised. Two of the best are adaptive cruise control and active bending Xenon headlights. I find lane departure annoying, so I've shut it off. I don't let any of these ""safety nannies"" drive the car for me, but if they can give me a heads up, I'll take it.On the downside are a tight back seat and no spare. There is an inflation kit in the trunk. This was almost a deal breaker for me. The dealer threw in a donut spare, which comes in a fabric zip bag and is strapped down in the trunk, a + $200 option. This makes a smallish trunk even smaller.Volvo offers the Safe and Secure plan, which covers maintenance and repairs (even brakes) for 5 yrs. or 50,000 miles. (Tires are not covered under this plan.)The car is very fun to drive and I'm happy with it. Hope this helps. "
"sweendogy","August 2012"," Jeffm - thanks for the review - I found it interesting the cars you cross shopped this against - Taurus and azera - cars that when you think about them seem to be in a different category but when you dive deep they are very similar - why not another Avalon , seems like Toyota improved a bit on the old one and it's a very near cousin to the es.

"robr2","August 2012"," The tests are what they are and they don't change substantially from year to year.Actually this this is a modification to an existing test. Years ago the IIHS decided that the head on test done by the government wasn't real world enough so they came out and tested offset crashes. The performance of most cars was poor so it forced automakers to design to get a good rating on this test.Now the IIHS has moved the target and changed the offset test from moderate overlap to small overlap. The moving target is the way the insurance industry gets the automakers to keep making vehicles safer in order to reduce the payouts they have to make. "

"markcincinnati","August 2012"," Shut down the stability control to save the brakes? How would shutting down this feature save either rotors or pads? OK, now I kind of get how if you push the car so that it ""needs"" to apply the left rear brake or right front brake or some combination in order to stabilize the car, you might save a bit of wear -- at the cost of reduced stability.But, if you are not in any situation that might require such an electronic intervention, why would turning the ESP off be helpful? ABS only comes into play when braking so hard that sliding tires are a possibility, but ABS typically cannot be defeated (it is just always at attention, awaiting to be called upon). I would think ESP causes no brake wear period if it is never engaged.Seems like turning it off increases the danger of understeer, oversteer and out of control situations (on dry, wet or snow/ice surfaces alike -- albeit at lower speeds the slicker the surface becomes). :confuse: "

Your ability to turn it on when you think you'll need it is an interesting approach -- to me it seems like saying ""I'll only fasten my seat belt when I think I will wreck.""The value of ESP is probably its most profound in those situations where you can't see or know for certain there is a coefficient of friction issue. Or even when it is not raining or snowing, it is possible to get yourself into an understeering situation or even oversteer before you know it and at that exact moment in time I would doubt someone could react and push the ESP ""on"" button.

( again in rain and snow, and on roads i dont know I keep it on)- i also buckle up - every time, never know when a guy with an a4 or Tl awd type s sh-awd will t-bone me at a light while he's texting .Enjoy the cvt and espn and the computers- But I dontCan't turn off the abs - but yes, answer your question yes I like to live ""that"" dangerously -like my old man with his 79 nova, I drive without espn. 2007 g35, 31k miles and not a curb mark. Don't be a dink "
"m6user","August 2012"," ""and like I said before stability control is a great feature but again what did we do without it- ""A lot more of us were killed....that's what we did. Stability control is probably the most helpful in an extreme emergency manuever. Just like ABS it helps keep the car under control. If you think you know for sure exactly when the next yahoo is going to run you off the road or pull out in front of you and you need to control your car than you should be a fortune teller. Traction control is pretty useful too. What did I do before traction control? I spun my rear wheels all over the place in the snow even with good snow tires.It's obvious you think you're Mario Andretti and could also care less if losing control of your car causes someone elses injury or death. And you are telling other's not to be a dink? Look in the mirror my friend.BTW, I haven't heard that term used in about thirty years. Maybe it's a regional thing. Kind of thought that went the way of ""fairy hooks"" if anybody remembers that one. "
"ivan_99","August 2012"," Back in 2002 I had a 2003 G35 when they were first released.I too had the traction/stability turned off in dry weather.The car was very well balanced and I would give it a little power to bring the rear end 6-12 inches out. It would always tuck back in and straighten out. You'd really...really have to try hard in order to spin out of control (I never had); it was very predictable and consistent.This wasn't a big NHRA burnout...but a small chirp of the tires with the engine revving and I didn't do it at every corner (that was when I was 16...) or near the daycare; just the odd time to remember my youth.Probably not the utmost ideal level of safety, but neither was the time I took a call on my mobile phone, reached across to the passenger foot-well to pick something up, fiddled with the radio selection, reached behind me to put a pacifier in the baby's mouth...and took it way past the posted limit on the highway (no baby in the car then). BTW, this didn't occur all in one day but the span of a couple years.Sometimes I eat too much red meat...but I wouldn't consider myself reckless :shades: "

"graphicguy","August 2012"," ray....BMW's stop/start tech seems to follow a trend with them. Like their iDrive, it took 2-3 generations for them to get it right. Same is probably true for their start/stop tech. It will take them 2-3 releases (maybe even model years) to get it right.Surprising, given BMW's engineering prowess, and their early adoption of technology in cars. No matter, since the feature can be totally defeated, that fixes what was an unnecessary and ill-implemented attempt to increase MPG. "

"flightnurse","August 2012"," I read someplace that the Auto Stop/Start can be turn off completely by having the BMW dealer updating the the software. Basically the update allows the computer to ""remember"" the last function of this feature. So if you turned it off when you got into the car and turned the car off, then the computer remember this and the system is turned off when the car is restarted. On a side note my neighbor has 2007 BMW 335i, been having some issues with the A/C, he bought it as a CPO, the car is back in the shop, he has a 2012 328i, the dealer forgot to tell him about the auto stop/start, when he left the dealership with the loaner, he came up a light, waited, the car stopped. At first he wasn't too sure the issue, went back to the dealership with the car where they explained this feature. He doesn't like it...

"m6user","August 2012"," It seems that if someone really, really wants a stick shift they wouldn't let a little snow stop them. I've heard so many times that proper snows and traction control let RWD cars compete heads up with an AWD car with all seasons. Now add to that scenario someone that likes to live a little dangerously in the first place and it seems like a pretty lame excuse blaming the car company.I grew up in Michigan on stick shifts with RWD with no ESP, traction control or ABS brakes on bias ply tires. Still alive somehow. "
"flightnurse","August 2012"," Sweeny what is interesting is how you turn peoples words around. The ""people"" you say ""car guys who say the auto is better car"" no one has stated that, what has been said is, that the newer generation auto have become just as good as cars with manual transmission. Now a true auto enthusiast understand this. There will always be people who will have to have a manual car, and there will always be people who will want an auto. Neither is right or wrong, but for some reason you have made it a point to say, that people who choose an auto is a lessor person for that choice. So why doesn't Infiniti build a G37X with a manual? Is is a lessor car then say a Audi A4 or BMW 328iX ? "
"flightnurse","August 2012"," Hey M6, my partner is from Flint and he says the same thing, and car's today with traction control and RWD can get around in snow very well, since most of the Car mag's are based in Ann Arbor Michigan, and not all of the long term cars have AWD, they do not seem to have a problem driving in the snow. They just change the tires to some good snow tires and drive.... "

"m6user","August 2012"," Sorry, I stand corrected. Didn't know you couldn't get the Journey with a stick shift. Wasn't trying to twist...just a mistake. But you didn't include destination chg($895) so the price is really even more which is $42395.However, the Sport model is loaded with equipment that is not found on the G37x so after adding similar equipment like the prem. pkg and nav the MSRP on the G37x is actually $43,745 which is more than the G37 Sport. You may have paid $36,500 but you would have gotten a similar deal on the Sport model. Just saying that if you wanted the stick it would have been very close in price and equipment just minus the AWD. "
"sweendogy","August 2012"," NP that's why I do research- Another thing to add at the time when I bought my g- they cars where structured a bit differently - the stick shifts were very rare and the ones on dealer lots were demos- infact they all got One Sport when the new body came out in 2007. So to say i would of gotten a similar deal is wishful thinking, I needed a car- did the research and was able to hammer out a deal; 31k miles later no probs - I would trade in a second for a 42k g37x stick, or a 2012 335x equiped the same at 42k (not going to happen) I think it's a fantastic value in sedan formThe destination charge same on all g37s "

"habitat1","August 2012"," If you prefer the looks of the 4G TL than good for you - because you are getting a heck of a good car beneath the skin.My ""snatched defeat out of the jaws of victory"" comment was really aimed at Acura shareholders, since sales of the 2009 TL, upon the redesign, dropped by well over 50% from what the 2004 model sold. And that was in a large part to the controversial looks. Here's the chart: TL Sales by year BMW had Bangle to contend with, not sure who at Acura decided all of a sudden that lots of chrome was in fashion, but it cost the company dearly in terms of sales. But, like I said, for those that can get past - or even prefer - the looks of the new TL, a 2012 TL SH-AWD 6-speed manual for $36,000 +/- is one hell of a good deal. Maybe not quite the enthusiast car as a 335Xi, but about $15k cheaper comparably equipped. "
"billyperksii","August 2012"," Can you pull the same data for Infiniti and Lexus?- Same time period. "
"habitat1","August 2012"," That particular chart source only showed historical TL sales. I'm sure if you Google searched around, you could find something similar for Infiniti and Lexus, as well as BMW and Audi. If it's any consolation, my old Maxima SE, which was a top seller in the 1990's and won COTY honors in 1995, has pretty much fallen off the ELLPS radar screen for most car shoppers today. I don't have the exact figures handy, but I think the current Maxima is selling at about 15% of the sales volume of my old 1995. Nissan really snatched defeat out of the jaws of victory on that one!

"graphicguy","August 2012"," FN......first and foremost, I consider the TL SH AWD to be in somewhat the same general vicinity as the 335i X. However, 335 is faster, handles better, and of course is less expemsive. TL still tugs on the steering wheel a little bit....even in AWD form. Still, for the money, you'd be hard pressed to find a car that mixes all of the attributes of torque vectoring, strong and smooth motor, top notch feature set of the TL SH AWD.It's cheap to keep, too.

"habitat1","August 2012"," Thanks for posting that data source - it is a great one to look through.However, not sure how you concluded that the TL's minor facelift has made much of a difference in sales? The YTD numbers are up slightly (12% +/-) through July 2012 vs. 2011, but they are also now giving away the car with up to $9,000 discounts. And the slight YTD bump is still nowhere near the sales volume of the worst/last year of the previous model. Here's the grim statistical truth about the Acura TL:2004-2006 Total US Sales: 227,461 (this is FWD only car, 1st 3 years after 2004 redesign. Average annual = 75,820. Up 37% from previous model, which still averaged 58k units last two years of it's ""aged"" design"")2009-2011 Total US Sales: 98,906 (this in spite of now offering both FWD, AWD models with 2 different engines. Average annual 32,969; down 57% from previous model and down over 25,000 average sales from last two years of 2002-2003 model)You can't look at this in any way, shape or form (literally) and not call the 2009 Acura redesign a total screw up from a business perspective. Acura pumped tons of money into producing two drivetrains, two engine variants of the TL and sales ended up getting cut by well more than half thanks to going to Pontiac for aesthetic advice and to raid their chrome stockpile. Even Porsche, for all of their focus on engineering prowess, realizes that looks do matter and has continued to refine the classic 911 style. But Acura was too smart for their own good, threw the 2004-2008 exterior in the trash and look what it got them. "
"sweendogy","August 2012"," ""discounts of up to 9K"", wow how pissed are owners of 2011s? "
"stickguy","August 2012"," you do have to keep in mind the market was vastly different in 2009-2011, with the recession having a major impact. Plus of course, strong new competition in the segment.but, even my wife/daughter (who know zippo about cars) when we passed a current gen beak TL said ""wow that is ugly"".the 2004? my favorite. I almost bought a 2001 new (great deal, but I was too tall to fit comfortably, though I ended up with a 2000 for my son a few years back, so I have one in the family), and looked at the 2004 when it came out. IMO< a huge improvement. Better interior, more room, and also way better looking. "
"graphicguy","August 2012"," stick.....I do think that the 4G TL's current styling is polarizing. That said, I remember when my dealer had a private showing for it when they first hit the street. I remember thinking how forward the styling was, which was something I liked. Clearly, I was in the minority because I liked it.The driving dynamics were quite a bit ahead of the 3G version, too. Tech was better, materials were better....just about everything was better with the 4G.Now, the polarizing styling has been ""smoothed"", other brands/models have caught up (and exceeded) TL's tech. From a price/performance aspect (with some pretty hefty Acura discounts), the TL (in SH AWD form) is still a compelling buy.It will be interesting to see if Acura makes the new RL(X)/TL(X) one model and drops the other. To me, the RL was never a real player in the lux field (E350, ES350, A6). I believe Acura could mine some gold with a ""tweener"", splitting the performance and lux difference between the TL and RL, having it priced accordingly (mid $40K).We'll see. Have heard of some nice specs on the new RL/TL car they've been parading around the car shows.Be interesting to see if Acura rolls out a TL-S next year. That always boosts sales. "
"flightnurse","August 2012"," Something else to consider, is Acura more aggressive in it's financing of the TL then ever before? I would have to say, yes. Before Acura (or Honda) really never would deal on their cars, but things have changed. So if someone is shopping purely on price, this could motivate people to buy a TL over say G even though the exterior isn't as nice at the G. "
"stickguy","August 2012"," funny thing is, not long ago there was a newer TL parked on my street, and I thought it looked really sharp. It was a real dark blue, and looked great in that color. But in almost every other color (especially light ones) I did not like it at all. "
"billyperksii","August 2012"," I see over on the G37 Board now you can lease one for $199, how infruiating it must be for the guys who are laying out $500+. "
"habitat1","August 2012"," ...why is there SH-AWD system such a gas hog??Compare the MDX (16/21 EPA) to a X5 3.5, ML 350 (both higher), or even a 400hp Cayenne S V8. No, wait, compare it to a 500 hp Cayenne Turbo (roughly the same at 15/22). Where is all that gas going?? The TL SH-AWD (18/26) is below the E350 4-matic, 535xi (both 19/29), Audi A6 (19/28) and way, way below the 335ix (33 highway).Perhaps SH should be changed to SG for ""sucks gas"".I am probably connecting too many dots here, but when we test drove the new MDX against the competition, I felt like Acura put all of their time and attention into ""gizmos"" and not into decent, responsive automatic transmissions, engines and drivetrains for the current MDX. The fact that everyone else seems to offer both better fuel efficiency and actual performance (the 300 horses in the X5 3.5i are WAY bigger horses than the ones in the MDX) seems to reinforce my feelings.As for why the TL SH-AWD gets 20% lower fuel efficiency than a faster, more powerful 335xi is a bit of a conundrum.

"graphicguy","August 2012"," habitat....while not the usual Honda/Acura fuel economy leader that we're used to, the 4G TL isn't too far off from what both my 335 and GF's S4 gets.Real world numbers are a bit different.When I had my TL SH AWD, I got about 18 MPG-19 MPG city. It fell down a little bit on the highway, getting 22MPG, or 23 MPG on a good day with nice weather.The 335 gets about 20 MPG city, but 28 MPG highway.The S4 (on a still green motor) gets 20 MPG city and 26 MPG-27 MPG on the highway.I know the F30 3 Series is supposed to make a big jump in MPG, but I haven't seen any reports yet.Be interesting to see if Acura does indeed go to a hybrid drivetrain with the 5G and what performance and fuel economy is derived.

Filled up one AM before work & jumped right on 95. When I got off the highway, I checked the TC while sitting at a traffic light. Average speed was 72 mph & average fuel economy was over 27 mpg.As I've said before, none of this matters because it still costs $60 - $70 to fill it up;) "

I realize that ""real world numbers"" can vary significantly for the ""city"" figure, depending upon how urban and stop and go the city driving actually is. But that 22-23 highway number you have quoted for your TL-AWD, unless its the Autobahn at an average speed into the triple digits, really sucks. I've never had a car that low, or even an SUV without a roof rack that low.My 2004 TL 6-speed is rated at 29 and will pretty consistently get 29-31 mpg at 70-75 mph for a 300+ mile highway drive. My former 2005 911S Cab, rated at 26, would consistently get 27+ on a similar highway drive, top up. 26+ top down. My former 2002 Honda S2000, rated at only 26, never got less than 28 and managed 32-33 on a few tankfuls cruising at 72-75. Even our 2005 MDX gets 23-24 on the highway, as long as we don't have bicycles on top. On our trip to and from North Carolina last week (1,200 miles total, including the week we were there), with two bicycles on the roof coming and going, averaged just under 20 (19.7).None of my numbers are read from a trip computer or for a short stretch. They are calculated by me filling up before and after, for trips that are at least 250-350 miles. On the other hand, all of our ""city"" mpg's suck no matter what we drive - welcome to DC. "

"habitat1","August 2012"," got to love a V8 that lops along at 1500 at 70 MPH.No thanks, and no offense, but the Corvette is, in many ways for me, the epitome of GM's screwed up engineering. It takes them twice as many liters of displacement to get the same power as Porsche or Ferrari, then they throw in a transmission that has to be downshifted into 4th gear to achieve terminal velocity? And, just so they don't get hit with a gas guzzler tax, they make that super tall 6th gear feel like you are lugging a locomotive? I was happy getting 27+ mpg at 70 mph at 2,500 rpm in 6th gear in my old 911 without having to play games with gear ratios. "
"sweendogy","August 2012"," Would have to say that statement for me could be the complete opposite on how I look at corvette at all. Twice as many liters, gearing (downshift) who cares you can get a vette for a third of the price if you are going to compaire them with Porsche and the Italians. Bad argument on so many levels - if you are going to bash gm the corvette is the wrong car to use as a reference. Enjoy the 911 and stick to talking about poor Mpgs in the mdx "

"nyccarguy","August 2012"," I posted about a friend of mine in South Fla who had a nice A4 3.2 S-Line that was totalled by either a large puddle or brilliant VW engineering. He originally started out looking for a CPO G37S Sedan. After speaking to him and raving about my 328xi, he decided to add a CPO 335i Sport Pkg to his short list. He was disappointed by the high asking prices of '09s & many dealers unwilling to budge off their asking prices. He got 1 place to come down $1000, but that was still over $4K over auction value. A dealer called him back and told him of a 2011 335i Sport Auto. The car is a 2011 Saphire Black/Black 335i Sedan w/ sport, premium, cold weather, navigation, automatic... Executive demo w/ 7,000 miles on it. MSRP of over $52K. He paid $37,500 + TTL. My friend has quickly forgotten about his beloved Audi.

He essentially paid what I paid (the capitalized cost of my lease) for my 328xi.He had looked at a few '09s. A dealer had one with 15K miles and was asking $35K.

"habitat1","August 2012"," That's a good deal - but it also reminds me that I need to collect my ""finder's fee"" from my friend that I referred to BMW of Towson. They had a brand new (not demo) 535i 6-speed manual, sport package, etc. etc. with a sticker of $60,000+. They had it listed on their website as a ""special"" for several months at $50,900. I told him to hand them a check for $45k and dare them to rip it up. They did the deal in late June at $45,500.Unfortunately, Towson didn't have any remaining allocations for build to order 2012 X5d's, so I had to order ours from another dealer. But the sales manager was pretty good natured about it - said I can always come in and buy something from their sister Porsche dealer at $5,000 over MSRP to make up for the loss they took on my ""hardball"" friend.Reaffirms my belief that there are always good deals out there if you are willing to shop around..

"habitat1","August 2012"," Yup, that's usually how it is...But....I don't think you need to (or should) go as far as to ""settle"" for your third (or worse) choice of color and options if you plan ahead and are willing to do the other three things.Acura makes it easy. Limited ""trim"" choices and color choices with almost no options to begin with. Find a dealer with a big inventory that has great deals. Other brands, with long option lists, are a little tougher. But, my recent experience with BMW proved to me that custom ordering from a dealer - which I always assumed meant paying a higher price than taking a car off the lot - may in fact produce the best results, long term. We had to shop around to a dozen or more dealers to find one that still had allocation spots for a 2012 X5d, but in the end, found one willing to negotiate a price that was within a few hundred (compared to invoice) of the best deal we could have gotten for a ""leftover"" vehicle on the lot. But, by ordering to our exact specs, we also didn't get stuck with a few options we didn't want, which ended up putting us ahead in the end.If and when I get another ""fun"" car, I will in all likelihood order a Porsche rather than take one of the lot. Trying to find my color and option preferences, given the ridiculous list of choices from Porsche, is a near fruitless exercise. And I'd rather shop around for a dealer willing to give me a 6-7% discount on a custom order than compromise my preferences to take a car off the lot (like I did in 2005) at a 11% discount, but one that had a lot of options that I didn't want and didn't have a couple that I now know I would like. A friend of mine who used to work for Audi (corporate, not dealer) indicated that, even though Audi is achieving record sales and many dealerships are low on inventory, you can still order one at or below invoice due to incentives and their desire to continue to increase sales vs. BMW and Mercedes. There is a saying in my business (real estate development) that a great deal on a fair property is not as good as a fair deal on a great property. For my friend that got lucky with a 535i manual transmission, he got the best of both worlds. But for most of us, I think I'd rather shop really hard for the car I wanted, and not be stuck with my third or fourth choice color and the wrong options for the next 6-7-8+ years. "

"stickguy","August 2012"," being able to wait should eliminate the settling issue.The internet makes it real easy to shop around. In a fe minutes, I found the dealer that seems to be hoarding all the ones we want (first choice color and interior). They have 3, no one else seems to have any! But, they are about 2 hours away.so my choice now is, take a ride, or just wait for a local dealer to get one.of course, the far away guy is also way lower on price. "
"habitat1","August 2012"," What I meant was that, in order to achieve respectable EPA highway ratings for the Corvette, GM made the final (two, I believe) gear ratios so tall that they are effectively idling at 65 mph and don't play any part in the use of the car as a sports car - i.e. what you basically have is a 4-speed manual with 2 overdrive gears. And that, for a variety of reasons, just doesn't appeal to me as something I would ever claim was great engineering. At least when Porsche decides to add a tall highway ratio like they did this year, they put it in as a 7th speed and leave the first 6 as before and perfectly matched to the engine output.I don't want to turn this into a GM bashing string, but here's what I see when I look at ""precision engineering"":Z06 Corvette vs. 911S7.0 liters vs. 3.8 liters505 hp vs. 400 hp470 ft.lbs vs. 325 ft.lbs15/24 EPA vs. 18/27 EPASlower vs. faster acceleration (to 60-100)Slower vs. faster around ""The Ring""Higher vs. lower top speed (in 4th vs. 6th)$76,000 vs. $96,000You can essentially do the same comparison for the ZR1 vs. 911 Turbo. I don't dispute that the Corvette is a lot of raw performance for the money. I just think that it appeals to those that prefer ""raw"" to refined. Everything is done by increasing the quantity - engine size, tire size, etc. And they still fall short of the 911 on everything that matters to me for a nimble handling high performance sports car. The fact that a 911S or Turbo costs $20-30k more than the comparable Corvette model may make them ""expensive"" to some, but I'd rather have the ""cheap"" 911S than the $15k more expensive ZR1 any day. I'm not going to be too disappointed that I am a few tenths slower in the quarter mile or a few MPH short in top speed. At least I will have a car engineered to get the absolute most out of less, and is ""screwed together"" very well. (Something that I am also going to consider when I cast my presidential vote this fall).  "
"sweendogy","August 2012"," ""No thanks, and no offense, but the Corvette is, in many ways for me, the epitome of GM's screwed up engineering. ""sounds like a ringing endorcement for the brand to me..while I agree the higher (""expensive"") priced 911 is a better all around car-- its still considerably more ""expensive""- couple of questions- i see you used a select use of comparion data- why the select group, ie no 0-60?.. other question is the """" around expensive- whats that supposed to mean?? a 25% premium (w/o options) from one car to the other, when comparing such cars seems regular, no """" expensive to me "
"habitat1","August 2012"," I was making reference to 0-60 in my ""faster acceleration to 60 and on up to 100+/-"" I know you are a stickler for hard data, but to be honest, I'm going off of memory of comparison tests by R&T, C&D, etc, whereby the Corvette had considerably difficulty starting from a standstill without spinning its wheels. I do know the new 911S has been independently tested at 3.7 seconds to 60, but would have to do some research to get a reference. Same is true for the turbo, which at 2.8+/- was the second fastest (0.1 behind the Veyron) ever tested. Not that any of this matters to me personally. Anything under about 4.5 is more than I need or care to pay for.Which brings me to the ""expensive"" quotes. I respect that for some people, $75k is expensive and for others $135k isn't so much so, compared to the $2 million plane they are eyeballing. I am a heck of a lot closer to the former than the latter. But for me, a $96k 911S (the cheaper Porsche) would be far more rewarding to drive and own than the $110k ZR1 (most expensive Corvette). Hell, knock the ""S"" off the 911 and save another $12k and it wouldn't change my mind. I just don't find the GM engineering of the Corvette is particularly inspiring or compelling. Not that I'm a German snob and don't think the U.S. is capable of it - in fact, I have a deposit on a Tesla Model S and may very well be driving my first American car in 25+ years by next February.

The Vette rings America, Big V8, baritone exhaust tone, flat torque curve. Now while the Vette is ""idling"" at 65 the car does pick up speed nicely while in 6th gear.Your argument is interesting, however, one needs to remember, when cruising along the highway, why does the car need to be revving at 3K. The owner just has to go down to 3rd gear and be gone.. Not a hard thing to do. Price a base model vette can be had for 45K, while the base price 911 is 86K. Not too sure if the extra money is worth the extra performance. "
"flightnurse","September 2012"," After months of looking and driving and fretting over a car, my partner FINALLY decided on one. Now, it's not a BMW, or Audi, or MB nor is it a Infiniti. However, the Infiniti M was scratched off his list very early. After an interesting week in Charlotte on my way home (have to love WiFi while flying) my partner tells me he finally chosen a car and will tell me about it after he picks me up at the airport. So for the next 3 hours I was trying to figure out what it was, so upon arriving in phoenix I narrowed it down to 3, Hyundai Genesis 3.8, Ford Taurus (eco boost 2.0L, 2013) and lastly VW Passt SE TDI. Not too sure why I thought the Hyundai but I did.. After getting my check bagged, I meet him at the usual spot on on the north side arrival by entrance 8. He is hungry, I'm not, had a good dinner on the flight but went out anyhow. So after a few conversation about things that happened with both us, I told which car he decided on... I get this look and reaction, ""how in the hell did you know..."" I laughed, but wasn't too sure which one, but had to guess again, so I went with the Hyundai, Genesis, turned out not to be the V6, but the V8 4.6. So at dinner he explained why he went with it and it all makes sense.... He loves cars, but not in the same sense as I do, he doesn't drive his cars hard at all...MSRP, $45,798, sale price $37,990, it is a 2012, White with Cashmere leather interior, and for 2012 all 4.6L Genesis came fully loaded. Granted it doesn't handle like a BMW, or have the ""bling"" of the MB or the style of Audi, but what it does have is VALUE... We picked the car up on Sat, and drove up to Prescott, AZ. Have to save, was impressed with the dealership and how smoothly the transaction was and how the salesman went over every item on the car with Rick. I was impressed with how it drove, seats are very comfortable, and handled the mountain roads with no issue. My partner likes BMW's and Audi's, but he couldn't justify the price of a 528 or A6 and he doesn't tackle the round abouts (or jug handles as they are called in Jersey) like I do, but he wanted all the luxury and room in the back seats for his clients. So the out the door price was just little over $40K, not too sure how anyone could pass up this deal (Yes I know some of you would without thinking twice.) The same dealer has a couple of Equus they had one on the showroom, MSRP $61,000, sale price $50K... "
"sweendogy","September 2012"," Good stuff- who would of thought a Korean auto maker could be cross shopped against the Germans and gain a sale- huge strides for the company as a whole - enjoy the rig "
"habitat1","September 2012"," Interesting, my marketing director is seriously considering the Equus as a replacement for her E-class. Her priority is luxury and space, as she often is driving clients around and, according to her, the Equus has a back seat that is closer to an S class than an E class in size and comfort. Her husband, a retired Navy pilot and much more of a driving enthusiast, couldn't be pried out of his older generation M5 with a crowbar. When he drove the Equus, he picked it apart relative handling, braking and precision relative to the German alternatives. But she's looking at the comfort, space and VALUE - and willing to give Hyundai a chance. Plus the dealer is willing to give her the car for an entire week to test drive. My guess is that the Equus will get a few more Infiniti and Lexus buyers to consider it than Audi or BMW buyers, but either way, Hyundai has come a long way since those shaky early years. "
"flightnurse","September 2012","  As I posted My partner looks at value first and foremost., this is his car, now if I had a say, the car of choice would have been a 550i, and I would have made up the difference for him. One thing people need to remember is, when Infiniti and Lexus hit our shores, the mindset was the same, who would shop a Japanese car and MB... "
"nyccarguy","September 2012"," Congrats on the new ride! Best of luck to you with it! A V8, RWD, sedan for $40K is a good deal! Keep us informed of how you like it! "
"flightnurse","September 2012"," While at the dealership picking up the car, I sat in the Equus and the first thing that came to my mind was, space, front seat and backseat has lots of it. After speaking to a salesmen for the Equus (not all Hyundai salesmen can sell the Equus) Hyundai brought that car over here to show that it is serious about luxury cars. In Korea people who have them have a driver, the owner doesn't drive them. It is an interesting car..For the money, the Genesis have plenty of room in the back (more then an E Class) and has all the bell's and whistles then a base E class has. So far reliability hasn't been a problem for either car which is something that MB and at times BMW can not say. So it should be interesting to see how well this car holds up. "
"wireless","September 2012"," The edgy-cool styling of the Hyundai's is starting to look a little dated.

"robr2","September 2012"," Interesting, since the Genesis sedans aren't edgy in design but very much conservative.I would presume wireless is referring to the Sonata. I have to agree. IIRC, I posted elsewhere that the styling would be dated rather quickly.The issue with the edgy styling is that it needs refreshing more often. For instance the Sonata design language was updated for the Azera and IMHO, the Azera is a very handsome vehicle. "
"flightnurse","September 2012"," I knew what wireless was talking about however, he didn't mention that in his post.I agree I was taken how nice the Azera was in person, I believe the Azera wont get old looking too quickly and easy to update... "

"sweendogy","September 2012"," Not that my opinion means much- but I think the styling of the genesis will hold up well after the years pass. It's got styling from both Lexus and MB. It's understated yet elegant - love the looks of the exterior - the interior specifically the shifter and nav look a little dated already but from the outside this car is a nice looker- flight you should of talked your partner into getting a ""r"" type. All in all a great value "
"sweendogy","September 2012"," On the company website it looks like they streamlined the line a bit - 2012 had 5 options, 2013 only 2 with the 3.8 and the grand daddy 5.0 r type. Wonder if the other options will be added late- or gone forever "
"flightnurse","September 2012"," The dealer didn't have any Spec R's and I doubt he would have gone for it if they did. I drove the car to Tuscon to see a client, cruise was set at 75, i averaged 25.6 mpg, on a very green engine. EPA rates the car at 26 on the highway. "
"habitat1","September 2012"," Say it ain't so.....cruise control on a green engine????Not sure what Hyundai told you, but on all of my past four new cars (Acura, Acura, Porsche and BMW) that was the one consistent thing that everybody said (and was in the owners manual): Do not use cruise control in the first 1,000 miles and if you have a long highway drive, vary the speed and engine rpms. My friend with the 535i manual is also a mechanical/nuclear engineer and gave me his interpretation as to why it is critically important that engine parts run at different speeds so as not to have single points of contact during early break in. My non-stop 510 mile trip back from Spartanburg in our new X5d was a test of discipline not to use cruise, but I varied the speeds between 60 and 80 and still averaged 29.4 mpg. You may want to check the owners manual on the Genesis, but I'd be surprised if what's being recommended for everything else wouldn't also apply to it. "

He hadn't driven it yet but his sales people had and it was a rocket.He said they ordered this first one with everything to show folks what is offered. He expected some entry priced units shortly. I asked him to order a turbo standard with the 6 speed so I could try it but he smiled and asked for a deposit. He knows the 7 of us who want a stick will probably order one!! "

"fedlawman","September 2012"," I just built an ATS (2.0L Turbo) with 6-speed MT, moonroof, and heated seats for an MSRP of $36,000. That's $2500 less than a similarly equipped 328i.270 hp, 33xx lb curb weight, and dimensions almost exactly the same as the 3 series. Impressive - I'm looking forward to seeing and driving one. "
"sweendogy","September 2012"," Lawman I haven't priced it out but if that's the case 2500 bux is a huge nut- wait 6 months and with discounts your prob over 5k in savings.. I haven't read enuf about the car to truly spike my interest, but the commercials are cool - plus only one caddy dealer I know up here I think still has a few new Cinerons on the lot as 1988 leftovers "
"habitat1","September 2012"," I am unfamiliar with the ATS, but....you might want to consider resale value before you reach any conclusion as to whether it is a good deal compared to a 328i. In my area at least, a 3-4-5 year old used Cadillac has almost no market appeal compared to a well maintained BMW. So, unless you are planning to keep one for 8+ years such that resale value isn't a significant factor, I think the $2,500 savings up front would translate into a huge negative difference in resale in 3-4 years. Perhaps it's different in other parts of the country, but that's the way it is in the DC area. "
"nyccarguy","September 2012"," Habitat - while that is true & I have the utmost respect for your knowledge & opinions, I buy cars for ME & not the next guy. There's always some excuse that the dealer comes up with at trade in time anyway. When I traded my Black/Black 2010 TSX Tech (49,000 miles) back in March, I got $19,000 for it. Now Acuras are supposed to have high resale value, my car was a desirable color combo, had the tech pkg (NAV, backup camera, upgraded stereo...), was a 4 cyl (good on gas), automatic, 8/10 exterior, 9/10 interior... I had a dealer offer me $16K (that's 50% depreciation in 2 years). He told me there was an 80 day supply of TSXs. When I told him that only 4 had crossed the auction block with Tech Pkg, he fired back that the NAV wasn't that desirable. "

"habitat1","September 2012"," NYC, Haven't checked KBB or other sources, but $19k for a 2010 TSX with 49,000 miles doesn't seem terrible, given that Acura is discounting the heck out of their new cars now. I just got another e-mail from Pohanka Acura indicating they would give me $9,300 of a brand new 2012 TL SH-AWD (manual or auto), which works out to around $36k. I have to believe that Acura's aggressive pricing on new cars would affect resale values of 2-3 year old, higher mileage ones. A used TSX Tech for $20k such as yours looks pretty good when a new TL AWD TEch is listed at $44k. Not so much when the TL can actually be bought for $36-37k. Not sure what the situation was in March.But I still think Acuras and BMWs hold their value much better than Cadillacs in our area. I fully concur with you that you should buy a car for YOURSELF and not the next guy, but for others that were comparing vehicles and looking at a $2-4k difference in price up front (only 5-10%), considering resale may help justify (or not) the initial price difference. And or those that don't care about resale because they might keep the car for 6-8 years, I think its also worth checking out older versions of what they are considering and see how they hold up. Just yesterday, a friend of mine picked me up in his 2002 Mercedes C320 with 190,000 miles. It looks and drives like its just nicely broken in. He mentioned that his wife's Escalade, after 4 years and 50,000 miles shows much more age with rattles, uneven leather wear, chrome pitting on the grill, etc. They bought the Escalade in 2008 as a result of getting what looked like a great deal compared to a Mercedes. Now, they are likely to give all of the savings back on a miserable trade in for a new GL. "
"robr2","September 2012"," While I'm sure that ATS looked nice, at $54K? No thank-you. I agree that $54K is a bit of a stretch for the ATS but you can option out a 3 series to almost $60K. I'm going to say that the ATS will do very well in the $35-40K price rangeThe enthusiast mags are already saying the 3 has some serious competition in terms of driving dynamics. But the badge snobs will still flock to the 3 because of the roundel. Personally I'm not interested in driving what my neighbor's 25 yo live at home kid is leasing.

"flightnurse","September 2012"," Habitat- the Escalate is just a suburban with bling, nothing extra was done to it and of course weren't built very well, can't use that as a comparison to a German built car.The reason why we got the Genesis at the price is the 2013 are rolling in, end of year, all manufactures are doing this, even BMW (with the 5 series). Currently here in Phoenix, BMW is offering $4500 off options (not too sure which option package they are referring to) plus $3K. "
"nyccarguy","September 2012"," And I agree with you that a mid to high $50 something thousand dollar 3 series is absurd as well. Much of the 3's ""advantages"" may be gone as well due to electric power steering & suspension softening.While it is true that 328xis are EVERYWHERE, especially silver ones like mine, the E90 is still an absolute blast to drive. I welcome the competition as well. The ATS looks nice, the next IS should be more competitive, the next G will probably make all of us BMW nuts think twice before a return trip to our local dealer.When my lease is up in 2 years, I don't think I'll be shopping in this ELLPS category anyway.

The current 3 series nearly as big (and heavy) as the 5 series from a few generations ago. And the current 5 is nearly as big as the 7 series was a few generations ago. Want small and nimble, a little one series, that seems tiny by today's standards, is not much smaller than a 1990 vintage 3 series. The 3 series can still be made to be tight, as was proven to me as I rode in the backseat of a 4-door M3 being driven by a BMW instructor at their track last week. But look at the relatively low percentage of 335i's that are equipped with manual transmissions today, let alone sport packages and suspensions. I don't think BMW has gotten soft by their own preference - rather it's more the result of their objective to increase sales and, as such, having to cater to a lower common denominator when it comes to American buyers. Frankly, I wish they'd just tell the softee buyers to pound salt and buy a Lexus. But then again, I'm not a BMW shareholder. "

Now my roommates brother in law at a Legend LS which I thought was a nice car. "
"habitat1","September 2012"," If I'm not mistaken, even the original Legend was built upon an Accord platform - or some variation of it. The Integra was definitely based upon the Civic. Part of the problem/dilemma with Acura over the years is that they have not put enough distance between themselves and Honda in the engineering and product positioning of their vehicles. Both Lexus and Infiniti put a much bigger gap between themselves and their respective roots. Acura stuck with Honda based FWD and V6's, even in their top of the line cars; and as a result has had to fight the perception that the Integra, Legend, TL and even RL were simply gussied up Honda's. It wasn't until the 2007 MDX that it wasn't simply a well equipped, face-lifted Pilot. Lexus had that problem with the ES - a gussied up Camry - but the GS and LS had no Toyota counterpart and were made in Japan. The early G20 was a Sentra based car, but at least eventually evolved into its own identity with RWD. The M and Q were non-Nissans.The good news for Acura is that Honda is a better starting point than Nissan and Toyota, in my opinion. But they seemed to have bi-polar disorder in trying to establish a true luxury division and then chickening out when it came to competing with BMW and Mercedes. They could have, IMO.Off subject, the best engineered car, dollar for dollar, I have ever owned was my 2002 Honda S2000. RWD, 120hp/liter without turbos, as tight of a suspension as a Porsche. I just wish they had more balls to put some of their engineering prowess into something that competed with a 550i 6-speed manual. Or, just introduce a Honda S3000 so I have something to consider before I buy another Porsche. The upcoming NSX is over the top in stylistic craziness and will, I predict, be a non-event. The S2000 was revolutionary and forced Porsche to improve their Boxster. But I digress... "

This board has a wide range of likes and dislikes and a very wide idea on what a ELLPS is, what I don't like are the personal attacks and how people continue to beat a dead horse and can't move forward. But humans do come in all shapes, sizes and personalities. When it comes to driving the new F30 cars, the 328i w/ the 8 spd auto is a good combo. Was at the BMW dealer on Friday, my niece wanted to buy a used 328i, and a local dealer had a cream puff, 2009 329i, Jet Black, Oyster Leather (great combo, no wear marks on the seats) Premium, Sport and Cold Weather package, Xenon head lights, power rear shade, Sat radio, Comfort Access, iPod/USB port. 46K miles, CPO and the dealer was asking $25,777. We couldn't get the numbers to work, and left, but I figured the dealer would call her, and they did, so on Sat we went back, she was about to get the car for $24,100 + tax and fee's. I drove a 2012 X3, i28, have to say was impressed, much larger then the last X3 I drove (2009) and the turbo 4 and 8 spd auto is a good combo, the transmission always seemed to be in the right gear when driving around town and one would be hard pressed to know it was a turbo...The X1 is a joke, about the same size as a CRV and Rogue for 39K, I assumed the X1 has the same 8 spd auto as the X3 and 328's have but they do not, they have a 6 spd... wonder why, cost ??While the finance department was getting my nieces paperwork together, I was talking with the sales manager and asked him how many BMW's does the dealership order with the M sport package? (this was a different dealer than where I bought my 328 from) and the number was surprising.... He told me 1 in 800. The people who are buying BMW today aren't really the sport people and they are looking for the luxury of the car not the sportiness of the car. I was basically told, if I wanted a 3 or 5 series with the M sport package, I would have to order the car, since he wouldn't order one for the dealership. In fact over the last 5 years the amount of BMW with the sport package has decreased, people don't like the sport seats.... Basically BMW is going soft because the market demands it.... Pretty sad....So my niece is very happy with her new BMW, she got a great car and it still has some of the factory 4yr/50K Maintenance warranty left and she got the 6yr 100K mile warranty... Knowing my niece she will drive it pretty close to the 100K mark in that amount of time. "
"habitat1","September 2012"," There seems to be a theme here that more gears is better. I disagree. Ranking the transmission options in a 335i, I'd put it at:#1: 6-speed manual#2: 7-speed dual clutch automatic (""auto-manual"")#3: 8-speed Steptronic (torque converter ""slush box"")Even the suggestion that an 8-speed Steptronic is better than a 6-speed is a little questionable. I recall when BMW responded to Lexus introduction of 8-speed autos with the counter that BMW engine torque bands were wide enough that they didn't want to add more gears to have the car fishing for the right one at a particular speed. Is the current 8-speed Steptronic a response to the EPA in trying to eek an extra mpg out of the engine? Just like the not so popular start stop feature. The 6-speed auto in our X5d has no trouble producing 30 mpg on the highway and accelerating like a (big) V8 from 50 to 80. I can see where the lower torque 3.5i might benefit with 2 extra gears, but the X5d doesn't need them. What's next, a 10-speed auto that has to shift 9 times to get you to a highway cruise? Or worse, a CVT transmission with an ""infinite"" number of equivalent gear ratios? At least when Porsche made their EPA concession, it was by adding a 7th gear to their manual that was a pure overdrive. They left the first 6 ratios untouched. The engine redlines in 6th gear at 188 mph (top speed) and the ratios are perfectly matched to get every ounce of performance out of the engine. That's what's important. And should be to BMW. Not playing a who's got more game with Lexus. "

I know I could score a few strokes better from the white tee box, but it wouldn't be as satisfying. It makes me laugh that some of my playing partners will spend $500 on a driver and then moan like babies when I suggest we play the black tees rather than the blues or whites. Regarding the X5d, the flat torque curve is precisely why you don't need as many gears. Every gear change results in energy loss. Small, but a loss nonetheless. By the time you get to highway speeds, the final gear ratio is all that matters, not how many shifts it took to get there. Around town, an extra gear or two might help, but a 5,300 pound curb weight is still the overriding factor. "

"flightnurse","September 2012"," I hear what you are saying as before I was the one who would never get a car that didn't have an auto, but not too sure if it age and or wisdom or both, but give me a good DCT over a manual...So in theory a CVT would be the best transmission since it does not have to shift so no energy is lost. Even though we know that Nissan is working overtime to perfect it, they have come a long way with the new Generation Altima and Infiniti JX, but to see a CVT in a true performance car, Nissan has it's work cut out for themselves. "
"sweendogy","September 2012"," I agree Infiniti is doing it with HP- but it's also doing it with price- real dollars that can pay for a boatload of gas and oil changes. "
"flightnurse","September 2012"," Value only goes so far, lets take my partners Genesis, for 2012, the V8 came fully loaded, no options, and it listed at $46K, priced paid was $39K (plus tax and fee's). It is bigger than a E Class and 5 Series, but smaller than 7 series and S Class. Now how many people who bought a E class or 5 series crossed shopped the Genesis, maybe not many, but they should have, but because people wanted a E class or 5 series that is what they bought regardless of price, even though the Genesis was a better value..There is a point in which value can only take you so far, and I think Infiniti is getting to that point with the G and M... "
"habitat1","September 2012"," Infiniti will be cross shopped by some BMW and Mercedes shoppers because although it may have some shortcomings, it is still generally considered a luxury brand. Infiniti may need to be value priced because of the shortcomings, but not necessarily because of a downscale image. Hyundai is not considered a luxury brand and must be very aggressive in its pricing to convince even a few E class buyers that a Genesis, coming from the makers of an Elantra, is worth a look. Add to that, quite a few of the current E class/5 series demographic are old enough to remember early Excels that were complete pieces of crap. A friend who bought one in the 1990's literally had the paint start peeling off the car inside of 3 years. Hyundai has improved considerably from those early days, but it is still very challenging to have your bread and butter cars selling for $15,000 to $19,000 and expect to get a lot of BMW/Mercedes/Audi cross shoppers into a showroom with a $40,000 Genesis or even more of a stretch $60,000 Equus. Even the Mercedes dealer down the road has a separate area of the showroom for AMG cars so that someone shopping for a $100,000 CLS63 doesn't have to rub elbows with someone shopping for a nice little $35,000 C250. Besides image, there is another value factor that is a little hard to quantify at this point. The price of a BMW/Mercedes can partly be rationalized by the belief from many decades of history that in 8-10 years it will still be a good, solid luxury car. Maybe not with the latest gadgets and do-dads, but certainly not ready for the junkyard. Hyundai has a few decades to go before they will have any kind of similar legacy. In fact, most 8-10 year old Hyundias are a direct contradiction to what they are now trying to position themselves at. "
"flightnurse","September 2012"," I agree with everything you stated, I don't think my post said other wise, however, infiniti can only be based as a value buy for a short time. I'm sure the next Gen G, will help improve the short comings that the car has, but at a price, and we will see the price of the car go up. "
"robbieg","September 2012"," I don't see why Infiniti can only be a value buy for a short time. I would think that they could and will continue to produce cars that are close to a BMW and at a decent discount. I think this is Cadillac's problem that they aren't willing to accept the fact they are a ""value"" luxury car. I personally think a Cadillac is on the same level as Infiniti and less than Audi, BMW, Mercedes and Lexus, and above Acura. Lincoln is a lost cause as far as I am concerned.Another point, why does Infiniti and Cadillac put logos on some of their seats? "
"sweendogy","September 2012"," What is a short period of time- ? the g35/37 is now in its 10th year, and 2 generations. I'm sure we will see a hike in price but don't you think Infiniti knows its main draw is similar performance at a cheaper price- I mean it's been doing it right for 10 plus years. "
"m6user","September 2012"," infiniti can only be based as a value buy for a short time.Why? No, car will ever be exactly the same as a BMW, or any other brand for that matter, as they all have their little differences. Infiniti has chosen a path to be similar to a BMW but also different( and in some categories better) and for a little less money. Seems to work for them so why do you say they can only do it for a short time? I don't try to come off as a marketing genius like some people but that's like saying BMW can only price a 3 series up to mid $50s for a short time because it costs too much. Silly. Just because something is priced a few thousand less does not make it any less of luxury car. If the car itself deserves to be in luxury class because of it's trimmings, equipment, quality and dealer experience...then it is. "
"graphicguy","September 2012"," robbie....I agree with your assessments. I don't know that Cadillac can shake its ""value luxury"" image, no matter what they do.FN....I see what you're saying. But, I think it stems from the fact that both Infiniti and Acura were, at least at their inception, marketed as BMW/Mercedes/Audi competitors. Whether it was ever true, I really don't know. I know the Legend was, at one time, King of the sport/lux hill. Lexus always chose the roll of a ""better"" Buick/Cadillac. The Infiniti M has tried, mostly in vain, to compete with the E Series, 5 series, A6. It never really crossed that barrier. The G got close to the BMW3, but never quite got there. Now, Infiniti seems to have fallen even farther behind.But, I can't tell if this is a temporary thing for Infiniti (or for Acura, for that matter). We'll see. As both the RL/TL(X) and the G are due for major redos. Hard to tell where they'll fall with those vehicles. "
"sweendogy","September 2012"," Lots of generalizations - no real facts in the statements above. Look at the us sales numbers and tell me how much they have fallen (except Acura)Try again "
"flightnurse","September 2012"," Sweeny if you think Infiniti is happy with second place think twice... Infiniti has ALWAYS been in second place, with the competition getting better and better, and for less money or the same as Infiniti why would anyone want to get a car that is always in second place? "
"flightnurse","September 2012"," Sweeny, over on the Infiniti board here on Edmond's, the price/lease payments for the G37's are crazy low, 18 month lease with $1800 out of pocket and payments of $280/m+ tax that is a steal, so if infiniti is ""selling"" a lof of them it is because of these insanely low prices, their money factor must be next to none thing. This indicator only shows that people are looking for a great deal and are happy with the Infiniti, I wonder if BMW did the same thing, how many cars they would move... "
"sweendogy","September 2012"," Never said they were ""happy"" - but I do know that the infinti brand for Nissan is a pimple on the azz of cars they sell- bread and butter car is the Altima. Tey have done a godoy job being a second place option to the mighty 3. They sell a boatload of second place cars- so for you to say they are always in second- might be the case - but again where is the slippage ? Why would anyone buy a second place car? Well it's a better value and has proven itself over the past 10 years- "
"sweendogy","September 2012"," On cheap leasing- Infiniti is just a carbon copy of what BMW has done for years- don't have the exact number but it's well over 50% of 3s are leased. They also have good residual value (and let's not forget the maintence scam) . So BMW has been doing the same thing for years guess you hadn't noticed the amound of $45k cars rolling on the LIE during the mini recession of 07-2010. "
"habitat1","September 2012"," I don't think anybody knowingly buys a car that is in ""second place"" for what their priorities are.I would agree that if you compare certain driving dynamics of the G37 vs. the 335i you will conclude that BMW has the edge. But do the same thing for a FWD or even AWD automatic TL, and you come to the same conclusion just as quickly. Price point, features, maintenance costs, etc. all come into play and - hopefully - one has the good sense to buy what they believe is the right combination for them. The problem would be if Infiniti priced the G37 exactly the same as a 335i, offered exactly the same features and options, marketed the car as a direct competitor to the 335i, but fell short on driving dynamics. I don't think that's the case here.Personally, I think the 335i would fall into second place if I was buying a sedan today. At a price that is at or above $55k for a well optioned, performance model, it is way too close to the $65k+/- that I could buy an naturally aspirated 8,400 rpm M3 at. No comparison on driving dynamics, period. But that's my value judgement and someone else's is likely to be different. "
"wireless","September 2012"," 335i - already 3rd place behind MB and Audi IME. Mebbe 4th behind Infiniti if price is considered. In front of Lexus though. "
"habitat1","September 2012"," Again, I respect your subjective assessment based upon your priorities/preferences. I can't imagine anyone objectively giving Mercedes or Audi a higher objective mark than the 335i in driving dynamics (assuming you are comparing to a RWD, manual transmission, sport package 335i). But, obviously, a lot of people buy Mercedes and Audi based upon other preferences and priorities. Even when I bought my 2004 TL 6-speed, I was willing to compromise on driving dynamics to save $10k, get more space, a little better foul weather traction, and the Acura reliability/lower cost maintenance peace of mind. I would not make that same choice today. Different time, different circumstances, different priorities. That's not to say I didn't make my ""first choice"" in 2004 correctly, just that I would make a different one today. "
"m6user","September 2012"," ""I can't imagine anyone objectively giving Mercedes or Audi a higher objective mark than the 335i in driving dynamics ""I didn't read into his statement that driving dynamics was the only consideration. This topic, ELLPS, is not just for people looking to drive like Mario Andretti the 1% of the time they get the chance. People look at these vehicles for many different reasons so just because a car is #1 in driving dynamics does not make it the best car in this class. To some it may, but others may put long term relaiblility and less frequent and expensive repairs at the top of their priority list. Lots of different folks in this category and not just those that want to drive a car to it's absolute limits. If one never drives a car to it's absolute limits than that factor becomes much less of a consideration. "

There are a lot of people out there who lease. I also believe there are A LOT of people out there who lease and do not understand leasing. You say that $55K + is too much for a 335i & you'd rather have an M3 for not too much more. I think there are a lot of ""aspiring"" aspiring ELLPS buyers/lessors who put money down on leases and say ""you know, for another $X down and just $Y per month more, I could be driving a 335i instead of a 328i."" "
"nyccarguy","September 2012"," To say that one manufacturer is better than another because of the current lease terms or current incentives is not right. Every manufacturer in this segment has some kind of different incentive every month to move metal. We all know how they do it. BMW subsidizes their leases with high residual values. According to BMWFS, after 30 months my 2011 328xi will be worth $26,406 with 50K on the odometer. My car is going straight to auction and they will loose their shirt. The car will be 3 model years old (with the 2015s coming out not too long after that, so almost 4) and the old body style. Infiniti uses low money factors. Mercedes-Benz uses conquest cash. Acura uses loyalty cash & low APR. If you follow the ""prices paid"" or ""lease questions"" of any particular make/model it is apparent.I'll be the 1st one to admit that my 2011 E90 328xi lease is a splurge for me. If it wasn't for the generous incentives ($2500 cash, sixty something percent residual value after 30 months, BMWFS makes 1st 2 payments up to $500 each) offered by BMWFS in March 2012 on leftover 2011 models, I'd still be driving my 2010 Acura TSX. "
"habitat1","September 2012"," I think you are right about the lease vs. buy tending to cloud or change the value analysis. I always buy and pay with cash. Keeps me from overspending and - especially when I had my 911 ""fun"" car - feeling guilty that I had payments due in January February and March with the car sitting in my garage. Lease equations can lead to different results. When we just bought our X5d, I couldn't see paying $1,500 for the premium sound package given what I thought was nominal benefit. But if it had worked out to only $10 extra per month for 36 months due to the way BMW makes the numbers work, maybe I would figured what the hell and checked the box. "
"nyccarguy","September 2012"," I think the majority of us here on the ELLPS board DO NOT represent the typical buyer. We're enthusiasts, many of us would take a stick even if it meant giving up a few 10ths to 60 & a few mpg on the hwy (if it weren't for our wives), & we shop for the car we like to drive rather than wear.There are people out there who have the mindset that a car payment is like another monthly bill. They like the smell of a new car every 2-3 years. If they are going to pay $500 a month (on a 60 month loan) for a loaded CamCord, then they might as well pay $600 a month (I'm just throwing this number out there) for a $45 - $50K BMW on a lease. "
"flightnurse","September 2012"," BMW has three option to purchase a car, typical financing, leasing and what BMW calls BMW Select. The BMW Select is very much like a lease, except there are no mileage restriction... So BMW has multi ways of buying a BMW.BTW, BMW does not have a special for 18 months like the Infiniti, and no one can not lease a $45K BMW for $280/m with only $2200 out of pocket.  "
"flightnurse","September 2012"," Why would people buy a second place car, for one, they can not afford the #1 car and to these people they are OK with second place...

Infiniti put those out there because they had a lot of inventory & a lot of people with leases set to expire in the next 12 months or so. They know the new G isn't ready & the current G is toward the end of its model run. People lease because they like change & variety. Instead of losing a pool of potential customers to BMW, MB, Audi, Volvo, Acura... They get them into THEIR new car for another 18 months. They probably waived a few months of payments & reduced their customer's current payment on the same car. Hopefully in 12 - 18 months their customers will lease a new, more powerful, more efficient, G. "

The BMW may be #1 in a couple of categories which is MOST important to SOME ELLPS buyers. To many other ELLPS buyers the value equation may be more important. Long term reliability and repair frequency and cost are very important to me as I buy cars for cash and keep them for at least 6 years, some longer. I want a peppy, luxurious, smaller car that I don't have to have repaired frequently once the warranty is gone(or before for that matter) and I like a nice handling car but I don't need one that I can zip around the cloverleafs at 70mph....50 is fine thank you. So BMW can be #1 for some people but for many it is much farther down the list for a number of valid reasons. Nobody is arguing that it is not #1 in cutting corners. So to say a certain car is ""loser"" or always #2 is ridiculous as it is #1 to the thousands that buy it. And to also say that those same people cannot afford another few thousand dollars more is elitist to say the least and condescending at best. "

"markcincinnati","September 2012"," We're all rationalizers -- some of the time or a lot of the time -- convincing ourselves that what [car] we aquired is the car we wanted (under the circumstances.) I have been away for about 250 posts and finally got enough time to mostly catch up with the posts that have piled up over the past 5 or 6 weeks or so.It seems that we're ""arguing"" (in the best sense of the word) over Infiniti being perpetually number two or Acura this or Hyundai that, 6-speed manual this vs 8-speed tip or step-troic that. I get the sense that the collective ""we"" -- the portion of the ""we"" that do not have BMWs -- avert our eyes and bow our heads and speak of Bimmers in hushed tones.It seems to me that the collective ""we"" would have only BMWs if only they had Infiniti's (or some other brand's) super lease deals. So I got to thinking, ""if"" BMWs were actually priced to lease (or whatever form of financing you choose to use) for $199 or $299 or even $399 per month (in other words, equal to or less than the ""price per"" that everything else is -- in the class we go on about here) would there even be any market left for Acura's, Audi's, Infiniti's, and all the rest?In other words, are we all (or almost all) frustrated BMW owners who ""rationalize"" not having them by using the code word ""value?"" Most of us who have the cars classed as ELLPS or even ELLPS-wanna be's (the Genesis, perhaps?) could afford any one of the cars herein discussed -- but choose not to go for the most expensive (assuming for a moment that means BMW) because they want to have that new home theater, children, Italian (or where ever) vacations or larger investment accounts.Who actually speaks the words, ""I settled for an X-place (anything less than 1st) car,"" assuming they did not get a BMW? Hmm, well, I would have rather had an A4, A6 or an Infiniti M than an Acura TL -- but I factored in ""opportunity cost"" (and in my case I'll call it monthly payment on a 36 month lease term). If the other cars on my short list had been offered at the same monthly lease payment, I probably would not have considered the TL.But, hell, if I could get an Audi S8 for $541 a month for 36 months, that's the one I would go for (I might even ""settle"" for an S6, just because I perceive the S6 probably handles better.)So, after reading nearly 250 posts in rapid fire progression, I have decided that ""we"" don't settle, we don't all ""wish"" we could have had a BMW; we just got something different because we do not think monolithically. Those who have BMWs have settled, perhaps, for higher payments or lower durability or quicker acceleration, better performance, higher or lower fuel economy, or whatever the facts support.Those who settled for the [perhaps mythical] $199 per month for 18 months Infiniti G, got, um, more money in their investment accounts or in their money clips -- who knows.I, for one, now have several friends or associates who have eschewed re-upping for another BMW in favor of a Genesis or Equus despite the Korean's inability to blow the doors off of an M5 or 7 seriese or S class. I wish there would be a place to see just how many ""conquests"" are made by a Genesis or Equus -- my friends experiences, even if their choices were significant data points, are pretty much just anecdotes.I'm thinking, now that I have but 22 months to go on my lease, that I will get an S6, assuming they cost no more than $599 per month for 36 months. I won't settle for anything less!Drive it like you live. :surprise: "
"dino001","September 2012"," I settled for an X-place (anything less than 1st) carI would have no problem in saying that. I go for value all the time. I almost never buy what I think is best in absolute terms. All I say in those situations: I know X is better, but it is by Y percent more expensive and I don't think is Y percent better. I even have no problem in admitting I would not have gotten my 328i, if Infiniti, Lexus, Audi or Acura had offered a vehicle passing three basic requirements: low sitting (no claddings, no ""crossover"", no SUV), rear hatch, and manual transmission. But they did not, so my choice was easy. Now, the manual wagon is gone. There will be new 328 with automatic only. But I got mine now, so I'll worry when I need to. "

"graphicguy","September 2012"," q....I saw that article comparing wildly disparate price points for cars. Car and Driver? The only issue I have with comparisons that include price, veteran car buyers tend to pay much less than MSRP. IIRC, I think I was almost $5K under MSRP on my '11 335i. But, I doubt very seriously one could buy a 2013 335i coupe (which is essentially identical to mine) for that price. Does that change the rankings? It should!Mark....man, if you get an S6, I'm going to be very seriously jealous.  "

"flightnurse","September 2012"," Nope never said cheapest now did I, I said best deal. M6 when was the last time you went and bought a Camry or an Accord? A neighbor just bought/leased a 2013 Altima, 2.5 SV, MSRP $26K, his monthly payments are $310/m with ZERO down 36 months 15K/yr. The D class of cars is a hot segment and high sales doesn't always mean being better. Nissan right now is giving smoking deals on their altima's right now to give them volume. I do have to say though, the Altima has a better interior then Camry, I currently have a 2012 Camry SE as a rental. In regards to Best price, Even mighty Honda been bending over to make deals to move the Accord, as well as Toyota. Starting next week when the new 2013 Ford Fusions hit the dealerships, add another car to the D class and see what happens.... "
"flightnurse","September 2012"," I wouldn't be surprised when the next Gen G arrives you see a G25 (or some other designation), with a turbo 4 making roughly 250hp. Since Nissan has some turbo 4's running around their parts bin that would make a nice addition to the Infiniti line up. "
"m6user","September 2012"," Well, five years ago we bought a Mazda6 for the wife and test drove nearly every midsize family car at the time. Is that a more recent purchase in that class than you? When did you last purchase in that class and what difference to the conversation does it make anyway? Do I have to have shopped in that class to comment on it? I really don't understand the rest of your post about neighbor bought/leased the Altima but I still get the impression that you are insinuating that people that buy these type cars are just looking for the best deal or best price without regard to which one they like best. Did your neighbor get the Altima just because it was the ""best deal"" or do they actually prefer that car over all others in the class? You said all they consider is the ""best deal"".And I never said highest sales meant a car was better. Just said that people were willing to pay a little more for the Camry than they may for others in the class which indicated to me that they were not just looking for the best deal without regard to the vehicle itself.

"flightnurse","October 2012"," Well according to Car and Driver and carscoops it is.http://carscoop.blogspot.com/2012/10/cadillac-ats-20l-turbo-loses-another.htmlLet the debated and insults begin. "
"dino001","October 2012"," Seems like they are saying ATS beat the 3 in driving experience, especially ""sporty"" twist road driving, but BMW was deemed a better ""all around"", because of interior and cockpit experience. It's kind of funny, because I always thought BMW are hard to beat on the road, but their interiors are designed in 5 minutes that are left after suspension and engine testing and the production deadline. Dashboards look the same as they did 25 years ago, the aesthetics are quite austere. Seems to me ATS has a few corrections, but the ones that are easy to make (better touchscreen experience and more cohesive design).So, if anything, C&D piece seems like this: BMW, we give you first place, but if you keep going this road (of bigger, softer), this may be your last time. This looks like lifetime achievement award and yellow flag, confirming all those complaints of long-time BMW fans, who simply don't care for the F30, even if it sells well.BTW, this is painful to me to write, but gives me a little satisfaction of validation of my jumping to E91 when it was still available. "
"nyccarguy","October 2012"," +1 "
"plekto","October 2012"," Yeah, I read it the same way. They pulled a Consumer Reports and gave the BMW the win based upon soft and fuzzy nonsense like the seats, and so on. Basically they looked damn hard for any reason whatsoever that they could to make their favorite car not lose the contest. Which is to be expected, really, considering that BMW kind of has been the benchmark for the segment since Volvo stopped making sports sedans in the 90s. They didn't want BMW to lose and any areas which were slight problems were probably given a pass versus them being super critical on the Cadillac. As is human nature when you're dealing with favorites vs a newcomer. But just like how Mercedes was the luxury car of choice for several decades (say, 1960-1990), BMW is now facing the same sort of problems Mercedes faced when the Japanese got into the fray. Except this time, it's GM coming for them. Nobody expected it and it has to be causing a lot of ulcers for BMW and Mercedes.That said, nobody is going to buy the ATS with the puny turbo engine. Everyone who has the money will buy the 3.6. "
"flightnurse","October 2012"," They gave the win to BMW for OVERALL driving experience, the ATS might have a sportier ride, but after awhile, that sporty ride wears on you. C&D lived the BMW engine over the ATS, as well as the shifting. Now the interior of both are very different, I wish BNW would stop the all black interior, however, the ATS interior looks very busy.I rented my first XTS, have to say, I liked it, the size is between the 5 series and 7 series, the XTS needs more power, maybe turbo charge the 3.6l engine to make say 350hp. Still waiting for the ATS to make to the rental fleet. "
"robr2","October 2012"," But he did say the ATS was more fun to drive. Since we're talking sports sedans, shouldn't that be a priority?Also he closed the piece by saying that BMW has to get back to building sports sedans. "
"sweendogy","October 2012"," ""Well according to Car and Driver and carscoops it is. "" Car scoops never said anything of the sort, it said both motor trend and c&d both placed ahead of it. Looks like car snoops is a news gathering blog of sorts. I've not driven either car but looking at the specs, and its most important spec being price I would be hard pressed, discounts aside to pick the caddy over the BMW. They seem pretty close on everything (I could be wrong) but if they are close on price why would you not pick the perennial leader. "
"dino001","October 2012"," This is a legitimate approach, to go with something you know rather than pick up the newbie, if all things including price are at par. My take on the whole piece it is now up to GM what they do with ATS. If they see it as a good (great maybe) start and go on relentless self-improvement path, this could be start of something great. However, GM DOES NOT have best track record of self-improvement. If they declare a victory and then expect to sell this product unchanged for next 20 years (excaggerating, of course), this will not matter at all and BMW is safe, even if on their own merrit they depart from their core values. "
"flightnurse","October 2012"," He also stated that the ATS was the first competitor to take down BMW. I'm sure BMW is aware of this, as we all know EPA # will be playing a big factor in how these cars perform it was interesting to note, that C/D averaged 23 MPG in the BNW while in the ATS they averaged 19. That is a significant difference. Something else the C/D editor stated was, the BMW engine was the better of the two, Again, the BMW won because it was over all better, fun to drive was one part of the equation here, but OVERALL makes it a winner.We can tear apart this review, and I knew people who hold on to just ONE part of the whole driving experience and point just to that and say, ""Hey, we like to drive these cars because of XXX."" However, winner aren't won because of one part of the test eval. "
"flightnurse","October 2012"," Dino I agree, however, GM has spent a lot of money on the car and have taken a completely different approach on this car as well as the XTS. I'm hoping that GM does continue to improve the car, this is where I think Infiniti lost it. Infiniti is happy to be where they are, I do not see GM being that way. As I stated before, this is great for us, I'm sure BMW will look at the ATS and say, HEY, we need to get serious about this again and make a mid-cycle change to the F30 that will pull it away from the pack... The ATS has more power then the BMW, however the engine in the BMW appears to make the power easier then the ATS... "
"dino001","October 2012"," I just read they put ATS on the dyno and it somehow ""lost"" so much of the power from the engine to the wheels that the output was comparable to 328. That could also partially explain the gas mileage disparity - drivertrain losses. Another explanation can be in the power curve itself. The ATS has probably much more ""peaky"" curve, which forces one to drive it harder to get similar performance. "
"habitat1","October 2012"," Has anybody driven a 10 year old Cadillac anything and come away impressed?? I certainly haven't.Yet last week I drove a 2001 BMW M5 with 120,000 miles on the odometer that a friend just bought from the original owner. This car drives better, with fewer rattles, than any 2 year old Caddy sitting on your local dealer lot. The paint looks better than a brand new Caddy. The fact is that for GM to be successful against BMW they have to produce a quality vehicle that will remain so for a decade. And they need to start with performance and pricing that is compellingly better. The fact that the ATS is priced the same, with no better performance than the 328 is IMO not going to win many crossover buyers. "
"dino001","October 2012"," Well, Cadillac has a habit of large cash rebates, so let's wait and see how the transaction price will look in a year. I agree with the rest of the your point. It took GM 30 years to squander its long legacy, it may take them twice as long to rebuild it. When a trailing runner wants to get up front, they have to run faster, not just as fast. At best, it seems ATS is just as good, not better than 328. This is something to talk about, but it is NOT something that would suddenly make GM a new leader in next two years. If they undertstand it is not a drag race to next light, but rather a multistage championship tour, where everybody makes improvements constantly, they have a chance. If, on the other hand, they sit on the laurels of ""job well done"", they concede the chase, before they even started. ATS - good start, even really good start perhaps. Just don't assume you're done, GM.The longevity of the design is also a good question - we shall see about that in five to ten years. "
"fedlawman","October 2012"," I suspect a comparison of Automatic Transmission versions of these two cars would result in a different ranking. "
"dino001","October 2012"," In whose favor? "
"andys120","October 2012"," Has anybody driven a 10 year old Cadillac anything and come away impressed??You've hit on something important. I drive a couple of Bimmers that are more than 10 years old* and both are still solid, good -looking cars that are enjoyable as well as reliable. The only problem for BMW is that I can't find a reason to spend the money on a new one. If they could recapture the magic of the Reitzle-era cars maybe I would. *2000 528i/146K*2001 330ciC/80K "
"plekto","October 2012"," Again, the main problem here is that they are comparing a nasty turbo 4 to a 6. So of course the 6 wins in smoothness and torque delivery. Now, if they did the same with the V6 engine from GM, I suspect that the GM would win.I've seen both interiors, and the GM clearly wins.As for it being a little too sporty/stiff/whatever, I'd remind you that you want it to be a bit like that since the car will still drive great when it's 5 or 10 years old. Well, that and the reviewers are rapidly aging and have gotten soft. I test drove a Cadillac CTS with the sport suspension and it honestly was softer than my 1990 Volvo. Sure, it would bump a little here and there, but go sit in a BMW 3 series from the 80s. Those were like having the tires connected to a pogo stick. When you got the sport suspension, your teeth would rattle going over railroad tracks. It just was how it was back then.BMW has gotten soft. Go test drive a Subaru WRX if you want a car that hasn't changed or gotten soft when it comes to ""sporty"". Be prepared to grab some Advil, though, if you're a typical couch potato. Personally I think GM has hit the right amount of sporty in their new cars. Enough so that you get good results and not quite so bad that your fillings fall out. If you want a couch on wheels that cradles you and sucks up bumps, buy a Buick or Lexus. "
"fedlawman","October 2012"," ""In whose favor?""I think the Cadillac would win. A simple reflash would change the power map for the engine and the transmission would mask any power deliver deficiencies that might remain.Of course, by the time the comparo is performed, BMW will release the MY14 and all the current complaints about the 3-series (soft suspension, numb steering, etc.) will be fixed.It's really kind of sad that BMW is basically building a RWD Buick right now. "
"flightnurse","October 2012"," Hey Fed, you opened Pandora's box by using the word Automatic Transmission, as you know some people do not believe that Sport Sedan and Auto trannys should be used together. "
"fedlawman","October 2012"," ""they are comparing a nasty turbo 4 to a 6""The BMW has a turbo 4.I doubt if the Cadillac's turbo 4 is nasty - consider the turbo 4 of the dearly departed Solstice/Sky. I think the engine management software just needs a few more lines of code. "
"flightnurse","October 2012"," And they are selling every single one with very little discount too... "
"fedlawman","October 2012"," It's been a couple of years since I've driven one so things may be different now, but at the time, the Infiniti G37 was the perfect example of a car that was horrible with a stick but brilliant with an automatic.Reading these two magazine articles, that's the impression I took away about the Cadillac. The ATS will be a segment killer with a slushbox.Plus, it's a brand new car - and impressive already compared to the benchmark of the segment. Give GM a year to dial it in and it will absolutely brilliant - three pedals or two. "
"mvs1","October 2012"," Has GM already won?Being that there is finally a discussion occurring on these boards and car mags running comparos they struck gold.I've owned many a luxury sport sedan from Audi, Infiniti, Lexus (well not really), and now a 335. When the time comes to get a new car I typically evaluate the entire field. I'll no doubt at least drive the ATS.... "
"fedlawman","October 2012"," That's why they're building it. They're giving North America exactly what it wants. :mad: That's why I drive 20 year-old cars... "
"fedlawman","October 2012"," Oh yeah, I went to a DE day a couple of weeks ago and one of the guys in my run group had a 2007 335i. During our first session, I saw him leave the track after 4 laps. After the run, I asked what was wrong and he told me his car went into ""limp mode."" I know BMW corrected this in later model years, but I've never seen it in real life before. To think that this could ever happen to a BMW is just sad. Times have changed and the sports sedan is dead. "
"plekto","October 2012"," The BMW has a turbo 4. I figured BMW always used inline 6s so I didn't even ask about the engine. So what we need is a 335i to a 3.6 ATS comparison. Because that's what almost everyone's going to buy if they care about performance. "
"sweendogy","October 2012"," While I think the original poster of the ats vs BMW - selectively posted the article because he is a BMW lover - it was a good post to open up conversation. These cars are very close - like I said before maybe 2 close. Caddy must realize they should of undercut the mighty 3 in pricing, maybe gm is trying to subsidize the volt vs this. For guys to say the caddy would of win if it had the auto, or if they compared the bigger engine cars, or if both cars were the same color - look these comparisons will come down the rode so hold on to your hat.  "
"dino001","October 2012"," It's not domestic manufacturer's style. They always put out price unrealistic price and then cut it with rebates and dealer marketing support, so their customers feel like they're getting a great deal. The problem is with magazines taking that sticker at its face value. "

I have a larger oil cooler in the garage now that I have to get around to installing this winter. Being an '07, his might not have any factory oil cooler (depending on build date and sport or nonsport, I believe), which is even worse. The n54 cars without the oil cooler are just doomed at the track. "
"markcincinnati","October 2012"," Who -- at Infiniti -- said that Infiniti is happy where they are? I don't know any car company that would publically say something like that. Moreover, I think all car companies have financial objectives that they must meet or top management will be booted.Why would Infiniti be any ""happier"" than Cadillac or BMW or Audi, etc, at ""staying where they are?"" :confuse: "
"sweendogy","October 2012"," mark - you are correct in the statements... that statement and the one about the G37 manual is aimed at me.. just jabs, no knockout blows because they are baseless and completly off topic- "
"ivan_99","October 2012"," I took the ""happy"" comment that they, Infinti, conceded in trying to reign-in the sports luxury crown from BMW, from various publications, and are instead concerned only with sales. Maybe with the theory: who cares who wins the comparisons if our sales (profit margin) are superior. It could be argued that BMW is also following this philosophy. "
"flightnurse","October 2012"," Bill, no one said it outloud, however, look at what the G is on paper...G sits on Nissans FM platform, the engine sits behind the front wheels to help in balance, , a stout V6 engine makes 332HP, RWD, A pretty good formula to start with, not many sport sedans have this combo, but for some reason Infiniti falls short. Why is that? The chassis is stiff, but Infiniti for the last years just havn't been able to get the combo on, steering, ride, balance and feed back that BMW has been known for. To me it feels that Infiniti doesn't care really. I'm sure Nissan has taken apart many 3 series to see how all the parts work so well together.. Maybe in the next Gen Nissan will finally get all the parts to work together. "
"tdbmd","October 2012"," I love the S line Audis, but too much cash for me. I looked at them before settling on a lightly used CTS AWD. "
"m6user","October 2012"," Guess what, I don't think Infiniti is trying to clone a BMW 3. They want to compete in the class in their own way and probably don't give a hoot if they come in 2nd or not in the car mags as a long as their product is selling and is profitable. That doesn't mean they don't try to improve their product.IMO the G has some attributes that are better than the 3, nimble handling is not one of them. If that is the only thing you care about then the 3 is better for you. For many others the G is the actual better choice when they look at HP, off the line speed, technology, creature comforts, reliability, repair costs, bang for the buck, etc. I'm sure there are lovers of other makes like the ATS that makes it a compelling buy for them. BMW lovers seem to be so hung up on being number one that they get upset when anyone says that a vehicle even competes with them. You don't have to win the car mag writers comparos to compete in the class. Otherwise there would be just one brand as the rest would have folded up shop long ago. This "
"flightnurse","October 2012"," Interesting, I never talked numbers at all, just facts, on paper, the G should be a better car overall, so far this is not true. So your comment about BMW lovers was out of line. I haven't swallowed the kool-aid BMW has a ways to go to be the car company it was once, however, some manufactures are still trying to play catch up, and they might not be able to reach it. "
"flightnurse","October 2012"," Reading these two magazine articles, that's the impression I took away about the Cadillac. The ATS will be a segment killer with a slushbox.  Problem is there are people who do not believe in a sport sedan should have a slushbox, only a manual... "
"dino001","October 2012"," You and what other five people? Just check some reality - what couple of guys write on boards like those makes is not representative to the market sentiment. I see more manual transmissions in commercials than in dealerships. When I was on the market last year, I checked inventory of five BMW dealers around my house - at that time there was NOT A SINGLE MANUAL in 3-series inventory, sedan, coupe, or convertible. So get a grip, man. You, me, or whoever else thinks MT is a must, we don't matter. AT ALL. Zip, Nada. If it was up to the dealers, they would let the dogs on us for messing with their business. "
"m6user","October 2012"," Should have said ""a lot of BMW lovers......"" as obviously it is not all that are unaccepting of anybody even saying there may be another viable choice. Don't really know what you mean when you say that you ""never talked numbers at all, just facts"". Aren't numbers facts? Kind of cryptic. Lot of apparent opinions flying around here trying to be pawned off as facts though. See, when you say a lot of companies are trying to play catch up you are in affect saying that BMW is #1 in this class to all people and that every other manufacturer is trying to match BMW or ""catch up"". IMO they aren't. They are trying to compete in a ""sports sedan class"" profitably They reference the sportiness of the BMW driving experience as people are familiar with it but they don't try to copy the car itself. Don't know what you mean by ""on paper the G should be better"". What, is it not fast enough? Or luxurious enough? Or cost enough? Or have enough tech? Oh, maybe it's just the handling that isn't up to BMW standards? Could that be it? If so, that is just one measuremet. I'm not against BMW by any means. Just don't think they are the be all, end all.

"sweendogy","October 2012"," This is now interesting. Flight you better do some serious ""fact"" finding to properly respond. "
"habitat1","October 2012"," You and what other five people?I'll take one of those 5 slots. And I have plenty of friends and colleagues that would create a waiting list for the other four.You may be right that the percentage of so-called ELLPS with manual transmissions has been on the decline. But you are also wrong that BMW and others still don't want the ""enthusiast minority"" being enthusiastic about their cars. Even though it might be true, I don't expect them to change their marketing slogan to ""the ultimate couch potato's semi-sporty semi-luxury machine"".Granted...there are plenty of enthusiasts - and even professional drivers - that will claim the Porsche PDK or BMW DCT is their preference over a traditional manual. I test drove a manual Boxster S on Saturday and the sales manager indicated a 50/50 take rate on the PDK for the Boxster S at his dealership. HOWEVER...there isn't anyone I know that has the ability to use even half of the capability of an M3 or Boxster that wouldn't consider being forced to drive a slushbox automatic as equivalent to castration. Without anesthesia. "
"habitat1","October 2012"," Guess what, I don't think Infiniti is trying to clone a BMW 3.Sure about that?? It's been several years since I've been in an Infiniti dealership. But when I was last there, they seemed hell bent on trying to sell me on the virtues of the RWD G35 as being much more of a BMW 330i competitor than the FWD TL I was considering at the time. I walked out with reprints from Road and Track, Motor Trend, etc. Interesting that I ended up with the TL. I made a conscious trade-off for several of the reasons you mentioned. Price, larger back seat (2 kids), reliability and maintenance concerns, etc. I got an OK performing sport sedan, but one that met my more basic transportation needs and do-dad preferences at the time. But looking back, I definitely think Infiniti had been marketing the G35 much more as a ""BMW beater"" than Acura ever did with the TL.The problem isn't necessarily that Infiniti doesn't quite have BMW beat in performance and driving dynamics. They are still WAY ahead of Lexus in that department. The problem becomes when their marketing department tries to sell attributes that their engineers don't deliver on. You don't hear a Lexus dealer claiming that an ES is a BMW 335i beater. Infiniti either needs to reposition themselves from a marketing perspective as different than BMW or have their engineers step it up and deliver the goods if they want to invite the comparison themselves.

But, neither hit our sweet spot (although, I'd take an A6 over a BMW 5 or Mercedes E class).I had never even seen an Audi S series before a few months ago, outside of reading about them in the trade rags.I'm a BMW fan. Like many others, I feel they make some of the finest sports/luxury cars in the world. Some have tried (most recently, Cadillac and Infiniti). But, no other company had been able to really hit the nail on the head like BMW has done with their 3 Series.However, you get one all loaded up (like I like my cars), and you're staring at a $50K+ tab at the dealership. That has extended to the 3 with the 4 cyl motors these days. To me, tough pill to swallow.The GF and I had been looking for a car for her. I originally thought a 2012 BMW 328i with the former 6 cyl would have been perfect, especially given the deals available right before the F30 hit the streets.We gave Audi another shot. Actually found an S4 at a local dealership (by accident....as it wasn't listed on their inventory when I checked on line).We test drove it. With a 2011 BMW 335i coupe, I was stunned at how good the S4 is. As ""MarkinCincinnati"" stated previously, the entire S line are overall among the finest cars I've ever driven. That's pretty heady company given I've driven Boxters, 'Vettes, BMWs, and many other really good cars. GF agreed!Now, it was only a matter of finding one we wanted and getting down to a ""deal"". Was able to secure Audi supplier discount, but had to trave to Chicago to get it (5 hours away).Neither of us could be any more pleased with the car. Yes, it's about the price of a BMW 335i, but IMHO a much better car. That's saying something given I still love my 335i. "
"markcincinnati","October 2012"," Once upon a time, I was one of those ""give me a stick shift or give me death"" kind of folks. The result? I had to special order the cars (usually Audis) that I acquired -- finding a stick shift was very very difficult in 2003 (my last stick.) Any stick you could find was typically on the base car -- which never made sense to me.Of course, I was wrong. Those wanting manual transmissions, even as long ago as 2003 were looking for ""purple squirrels"" -- today we former purple squirrel seekers understand that stick shifts are basically not even blips on many, no, most car company's radar (sales wise). This is clearly aimed at 'mericans, but in my many travels to Europe, well, stick shifts are going the way of the dumb phone. Given a choice of a 6, 7, 8 or more speed clutchless auto, CVT auto or regular auto, most folks -- by far -- seek to go clutchless.I say we all better get over it and realize that stick shifts make for good TV commercials and perhaps make for good reading about -- for those of us with too many car magazine subscriptions, but overwhelmingly at least 97.5% of ""us"" (even those who have NO problem driving a stick) wouldn't even consider a stick and certainly wouldn't consider ordering one and waiting 12 weeks for it to arrive.A contemporary 8-speed ""slush"" is so much better than the 4,5 and even some 6 speed autos of the not-too-distant past most folks probably say ""why bother"" (with a stick shift)? The 7-speed DSG's are also wonderful and in most cases (if you believe the test reports) are able to equal and often better 6-speed manuals.Stick shifts make for good ad copy and for the 2.5% of us who might actually buy one, it is nice to know sticks aren't dead (yet). The truth of the matter -- for me -- is that I would rather spend time and treasure on a sport suspension package, sport seats, wheels and super sticky tires (even the Max Performance tires, tho, are rapidly becoming an endangered species here in the US where most folks don't swap wheels and tires for summer and winter duty.)The 10th largest BMW dealership (according to them, at least) is here in Cincinnati -- they have no manual transmission new cars on the lot. If you ask them, they say there is little use in floor planning them since they sit forever, until they are discounted so heavily that folks are willing to ""settle"" for a stipped-down base Bimmer. If you want to blame something for the stick's demise (besides ignorance and apathy -- and indifference), blame mobile smart-phones. You can't possibly drive a stick shift when you have both hands on the phone texting your little heart out, all the while steering with your knees.Hell, I'll go so far as to suggest that the self-driving car can't come soon enough for most folks. :surprise: "

"m6user","October 2012"," It's been several years since I've been in an Infiniti dealershipWow, there's some real credibility speaking here. Yes, I'm sure that I don't think Infiniti is trying to clone a 3. Can't prove it that why I said ""I think"". I believe you may have marketing confused with reality. Everybody markets their cars to be this or that. Even, BMW with their crappy stop/start system and steering that is getting to be more vanilla every year. The BMW 328 is slow in straightline compared to a G but every BMW fanboy comes back and says ""oh, but straightline speed means nothing...it's the driving dynamics of the BMW that are so good"". Ok, if one cares so much more about driving dynamics that speed than get a BMW. If one wants OK dynamics but also some great power get a G among other things considered. The standard TL is like a boat compared to the standard G. Now the sh-awd TL is great but is still huge compared to the G or the BMW 3. It's the size of the current 5 series.BTW, I would match Infiniti's reliability and maintenence costs against Acura anyday.

"habitat1","October 2012"," BTW, I would match Infiniti's reliability and maintenence costs against Acura anyday.

Everybody markets their cars to be this or that. I have no trouble distinguishing between marketing and reality. The fact is that when Infiniti and Lexus first came to the market, Lexus took aim at Mercedes and Infiniti took aim at BMW. No cars epitomized this more than the LS400 and Q45. As time went on, Lexus continued to send over cars that were luxurious, and well made, never-mind that they completely lacked a sporting soul. Infiniti tried to distinguish itself with performance. It has had marginal success. The problem comes from setting too high of market/customer expectations by comparing yourself to something you aren't. Look, for my age, I'm a pretty good baseball player. Maybe even very good by the standard that hardly anybody my age still has metal cleats and isn't afraid to stand in against a 30 year old pitcher that can still throw 80+. But I don't compare myself to Bryce Harper. More like Bob Uecker. That sets a reasonable expectation for my fan base (i.e. wfe and daughters) that, when I actually get a couple of hits and steal a couple of bases, they congratulate me. Rather than boo me when my throw from third to first ends up somewhere in the home team dugout. If you are going to talk the talk, you better be able to walk the walk. "
"markcincinnati","October 2012"," My wife and I have had so many German cars, I do feel I can offer up a data point or two, rather than ""just"" an anecdote.Audis and BMW's (through 2009, at least) are breathtakingly expensive to have beyond their factory warranties. I say this even though I now would ""risk"" keeping one of these Germans beyond 50,000 miles. I would, however, start to get downright nervous (and twitchy) once my German car got beyond 60,000 or perhaps 65,000 miles.Not so with Acura's and Infiniti's. I must inject here that we have had 29 Audis, 3 BMW's and 3 VW's since the late 1970's and only two ""Japanese"" representatives -- a 2012 Acura TL Advance SH-AWD and a 2011 Infiniti FX35 AWD.Here is why I qualified my observations regarding the Acura and Infiniti: we've only had 2 of them and we have had both of them less than 2 years (each). For all I know, the Acura and Infiniti will blow up (expense wise) just like the Germans, post-50,000 miles. I doubt it and here's why.Every German car we've had is, ""at birth,"" the best driving auto ever -- and then at 5,000, 10,000 and sometimes even 15,000 miles they get even better (the engine finally reaches its maximum efficiency apparently.) Yet, somewhere between 15,000 and 25,000 miles, the German car really needs a ""tune up"" just to keep its (or my) spirits lifted. What I mean by this is that the German cars, thus far in my experience, have been the best driving and performing cars ever, time after time. Yet, these high-strung darling's age so quickly, so noticably and they just ""loose that lovin' feelin'"" unless they are maintained by sacrificing so very much coin of the realm. In the case of the Audis and BMW's -- thankfully -- bumper to bumper maintenance for 50,000 miles masked what that man behind the curtain was doing to keep pumping up the Audi and/or BMW to approximately full strength.Put simply, the Germans show their age unless given lots of TLC ($).Conversely, my wife's FX with about 35,000 miles on it is showing virtually no visual wear and is also ""feeling new"" -- there was no need for a mini overhaul post 25,000 miles as was required on every German car we've ever had (to maintain that new car feeling.) My Acura, too, at 25,000 miles seems to deny any perceptable effects of the miles on it. Only the front rotors on the Acura (which felt way warped at 8,000 miles) give anything about its age away -- and the rotors, after three turnings are eligible to be replaced under warranty (I've had them turned twice, to no avail.)So, from my perch, looking down on the dozens of cars the missus and I have had since the '70's, I would say if you want great driving cars (temporarily great, that is) go German, and just realize they are the equivalent of being married to a super model -- they're high maintenance to keep up appearances.The Japanese cars aren't quite the ""lookers"" that the Germans are, but they are reliable and durable in ways, thus far, that seems to have eluded Germany's finest.Now, one final comment -- I would not hesitate to get another Audi. I do believe they are virtually if not literally as reliable as any of the competition. I also believe they are not even close to being as durable as these Premium Japanese cars are -- the Germans age so quickly and are oh so very expensive to ""keep young."" I don't know what secret sauce seems to prevent the Japanese cars from aging -- apparently, at least. Yet, it just seems like the old adage, you may have superior performance with high overall maintenance costs or reliability and durability with low overall maintenance costs, but not both.Here's the thing -- all of these cars (ELLPS) are far more capable performers than most of us are driviers; and, all of these cars (ELLPS) are reliable at least to 50,000 miles. What we seem to be facing -- today, at least -- a choice of driving a great car that dies young or driving a very good car that outlasts your affection for it.Maybe good really is the enemy of great.""Whenever an individual or a business decides that success has been attained, progress stops."" - Thomas J. Watson of IBMMy TL is a good car, no matter what you say! :P "
"habitat1","October 2012"," I must inject here that we have had 29 Audis, 3 BMW's and 3 VW's since the late 1970's and only two ""Japanese"" representatives -- a 2012 Acura TL Advance SH-AWD and a 2011 Infiniti FX35 AWD.I certainly appreciate and respect your experience, but just how many of these cars have made it past 50-60k miles for you to make your durability judgements?? It appears that you have owned a significant percentage of the Audis sold in the US. And if my math is correct, the 37 vehicles you have owned since the late 70's suggests an average hold period of 2+/- years assuming that you only had 2 in your garage concurrently.That said, I don't dispute your conclusions. I definitely think the German cars have historically required a lot more ""routine maintenance"" to keep running up to snuff than the Japanese. I believe that is changing a bit. In both directions. My 2004 Acura TL has gone through 2 sets of brakes (including front rotors) in 65,000 miles (manual transmission = Brembo front brakes). My 1995 Maxima didn't have the front brake pads replaced until it hit 105k miles the rears at 125k miles and never needed rotors replaced when we gave it away at 15 years and 160k miles. By the same token, I believe the Germans have become a little less high maintenance over the past decade or so. My 911 did not call for it's first oil change until 2 years or 20,000 miles :surprise: They don't offer a maintenance plan, so this wasn't some cheapskate way of reducing their costs. Granted, when something breaks out of warranty, you can hand them a limb or two along with your IRA, but compared to the old days, the cars spend more time in your garage than your mechanics.P.S. Friend of mine back in the early 1980's owned an Audi Coupe. Sexy. I had a Datsun B210 GX at the time. Not sexy. I made him take me to dinner every time I had to drive him from suburban Phili to Wilmington to take his car in or pick it up for service. I put on 10 pounds in about 8 months before he ditched it.

I never posted #'s or stated which one was better when I posted the URL,you have taken what was in the video and turned it around like I have made a statement that one was better then other. Now, I did say, that C/D stated that the BMW was the overall winner, in fact, that is why C/D has always picked the 3 series as the winner, because of the over all feel, way it drives. I think you need to re-watch the last part of the video to hear what they say.Don't know what you mean by ""on paper the G should be better"". If you read a posting I posted you would have gotten this. The G's chassis is what Nissan call's the FM platform, where the engine sits behind the front wheels, this like the RX-8 makes for a better handling car, chassis is plenty stiff, RWD, weight in line, manual trans, hefty V6, however, Nissan for what every reason missed the mark on some points. Hopefully the next generation G all the short coming of the current G will be worked out. "
"flightnurse","October 2012"," Put simply, the Germans show their age unless given lots of TLC ($).  Mark with 29 cars how many of then did you drive to 50 or 60K? Currently my 2005 330i has no rattles, both doors close with the same solid thud as when it was new. The engine continues to pull to red line without missing a beat. Oil changed every 5K miles, air filter cleaned at 5K, the only out of pocket expense really has been the after market equipment I bought for the car. So really not too sure what you mean by extra TLC? You what to know about TLC, own a British car, my father and I bought a 1957 TR3, NOW that car needed TLC.... "
"plekto","October 2012"," Don't forget, though, that this also is a huge plus for Cadillac. Repairs are inexpensive (parts are actually less now than Toyota or Honda!) and they happen fairly infrequently compared to the European makes. Add in pretty decent incentives (incentives from Acura or Lexus??), and it's compelling.$32K for a CTS (actual price via Truecar on a 2012, which isn't as low as you can negotiate yourself, even) versus $40-45K or more for a 3 series (335i)... It certainly makes you wonder. The smart money is on the CTS and to simply ignore the ATS until you can get one next fall in the 27-28K range after incentives. As for my father's CTS, in two years it's had zero warranty repairs or issues with it. Nothing squeeks, rattles, or feels any different than the day he bought it. Quite a departure from his previous GM vehicles. You'd swear it was made by Totoya. But the engine is without a doubt made in Germany. It's exactly like having a BMW or Mercedes engine and a body that is made by Totoya - just without their appalling lack of styling. "
"andys120","October 2012"," Mark, your constant repetition of the erroneous idea that it is financially ruinous to own a German-made car is annoying but keep it up. As long as folks believe it there will be a constant supply of wonderful, lightly used BMWs and Audis for sale for 50% and less of the new price.This winter, for the third time, I bought a second-hand German car. I got an 80K miles BMW 330ciC for the MSRP cost of a loaded Ford Fiesta.

I do have to give you guys an A for persistence.But before you take the report card to McDonalds for a free Happy Meal, you might want to retest the doors of the CTS in another year or two. I know people - similar to Flight's experience - that have 6-8-10 year old BMW's and Mercedes with 100k+ miles that still have the new car look, sound and feel.

There was a time that anyone who wouldn't/couldn't drive a manual transmission, in my mind, should not be allowed on public roads, as they didn't really know how to drive.Now, as you state, as good as auto trans cars have become so good (particularly the 7 sp dual clutch DSG in Audis), that there's little hope that even someone who's really good with a manual trans could possibly out perform it.Because MPG is becoming more an more paramount, auto transmissions will capture that crown, too.Generally speaking, today's auto transmissions are simply better than their manual counterparts. I'm good with a manual trans car....I've tracked them both at zutox and 1/4 mile events. So, it takes quite a bit for me to admit those new auto transmissions are better. But, they are. "
"m6user","October 2012"," Wow, that's some real credibility (and loyalty) speaking hereI guess you insinuate that owning an Infiniti for ten years is really not that much credibility but I would counter that never owning one and not even being in a dealership(test drives) in years is much, much less credibility. As far as loyality goes, I would love to have another Infiniti but they just don't make the type and size of vehicle that I now want(not talking about a G here). It has nothing to do with with liking the brand. If they made a vehicle that was very similar to the Acura I just bought then I would have bought it in a heartbeat. Besides I also like to sample different brands from time to time. Never know what you're missing until you try it, right? Are you saying that I should be loyal to brand without fail? That would be pretty stupid IMO. No brands are that good or perfect by any means.People seem to take marketing and advertising too literally. It's just hype. The only customers who believe the hype and are dissappointed are the naive ones that believe all that crap in the first place. When a company says it is targeting something they are using it as benchmark. They are actually complimenting the known quantity by saying they are trying to be like it in many ways, not a carbon copy. In some ways they succeed and some they don't. BMW is not perfect either and especially is not the right car for many people. I pay cash and keep vehicles for at least 6-10 years. I shy away from cars that need a lot of expensive repairs and maint after the warranty is over because I just don't need the hassle long term. I can afford the repairs but I just don't want to deal with them. If I leased or traded every 3-4 years it would possibly be different. Congrats on being able to play baseball at your age whatever it is. Didn't quite get the connection to the discussion though unless you're constantly marketing yourself as a great baseball player. Has Infiniti been marketing itself as better than BMW? I don't believe so. They may market the G as an alternative to the BMW and that it is, an alternative....not a copy. "
"markcincinnati","October 2012"," We can all chuckle a bit at folks (like me) who keep buying German cars and finding them the best driving, best performing, most grin inspiring cars ever -- only to find they require so much attention to keep at that level of gratification.But, there it is, out there for all to at least smile and nod knowingly. And, as I said, despite our considerable experience and the experiences of others both the pros and amateurs alike regarding the overall durability of these wunderkinds, many of us become hooked on German cars almost as if it is an addiction. The reason to repeat and repeat and repeat and lust after future repeat acquisitions of these German cars belies their sometimes dismal durability.I sit here watching an episode of Motor Week wherein the test du jour is of the 2013 Audi S4 and S5. After a totally favorable review, the last sentences goes: ""we're not particularly impressed with Audi's reliability; but that wouldn't keep us from parking one in our garage.""The hell of it is, these [German] cars are just the best to drive, but disappointing and expensive to keep much beyond 50K miles. I know you may think with the amount of turnover we've had in our German's that we ""don't know nuttin' about birthin' no babies,"" however, I assure you that with about 3 dozen of them, our experiences might lend credence to our conclusions. If you've had one or two really reliable Bimmers or Mercs or Audis, great -- give us a full report after about 20 more.On the other hand, if you, like me, get hooked on the German car experience, feed your habit, you won't regret it assuming you place value on that certain je ne sais quoi only to be had in a German car.Like I said, my TL is a good car. It isn't exactly marrying material though. "

"plekto","October 2012"," I've owned Mercedes, Toyotas, Volvos (before Ford ruined them), and quite a few other cars. And the CTS is really bolted together and built like the best cars you can get from Japan. GM basically stole engineers from BMW and Mercedes, so when the engine is built in Germany, well, it really IS built by the best engineers. It's fantastic. And BMWs are also fantastic when it comes to the engines and drive-trains. BUT... the rest of the car is... problematic.  I can drive a 2 year old BMW and the interior is already suffering and the fiddly bits and switches and so on are showing their age rather rapidly. BMW apparently spends everything on how it drives and the rest of it is simply put together like a Kia. GM actually has at least this part down-pat. Their interiors are excellent and in fact, often out-last Toyota and Honda. The rest of their cars in the past was crap, but the interiors were great.Now, they have a good platform and a good interior. And it won't start crumbling on you at 50 or 80k. You can just look at the first generation CTS for examples of this. And they aren't as well built as the 2nd generation. You can laugh. All the way to the poor house as you're either leasing forever or paying outrageous repair bills for the most silly things.The ATS? It really needs a little more time to decide if it's a great car or not. But so far, for a first year model, that it got that close to a 3 series, AND it's not going to suffer from BMW-itis as it ages... BMW's days are numbered at this rate if GM of all companies can make them sweat. "

Not even in the same ballpark. "
"buya","October 2012"," To me, it's not an addiction. Those cars are better in comprehensive view. I drive and own German built cars only, and I thought it would be snobbish to rule out other cars. It's not. It's preference, just like some people like to hear the revving and roaring of their cars, and some prefer the quietness in their sports cars. I'm not particularly fond of MB, and I swore not to consider buying another MB when I sold my last one. It's been over a decade. I'm still driving a MB and admiring the engineering and handling, but I'm not serious about buying MB. My BMW was a reliable car but the style looked old quickly. I haven't bought a BMW for decades. I moved on to other European cars since MB for their curves. I've to say my cars are all very reliable and I adored them all. What's wrong with MB is that they went cheap on material! I haven't seen anything chipped in any other old or older cars except in the 8 years old SL500. Unforgivable!! These cars are all 1-owner well maintained cars, so it's not maintenance issue. It's MB quality control. I had driven a Camry V4 as a loaner from a non-MB dealer when my car was way out of warranty, and I thought that Camry was very nice. It would be for city driving, but don't take it out of town. Toyota cars have issues like other brands, but the repair costs of a Toyota car is not as high as most German cars. A visit to a European dealership for repair or whatnot can easily set you back $2K + change and that could happen a number of times in a month for the same problem. But it's not the same to the dealers of course.With German cars, durability is not an issue, however, if you can't stand the little annoyances of electronic problems, then you may find reliability to be. Since I'm looking for a sensible car and trying very hard to exclude German cars and other European cars, except VW, Volvo, etc., I test drove a lot of cars that I thought was worthy. Infiniti is cool. Acura SH-AWD are cool. Subaru Flat 4 needs a booster, base Accord 2013 vibrates uncomfortably on city streets, xB is nice, ... So, what's the bottom line? If you're looking for performance of certain type and are used to driving high-end European cars, the best is to stay with the cars you know. "

He has been through the entire line up of GM ""premium"" products and after a couple of Iron Cities would admit envy to be able to buy anything German just once before he punches out that final time card and goes to the Union hall in the sky. His experience with Cadillac Escalades has been particularly painful and frustrating. His Corvette was also a conundrum of ""the best of things, the worst of things"". Horsepower out the wazu, but the interior was almost unbelievable. The steering wheel looked like it came out of a Malibu. The seats were beyond atrocious with minimal lateral support. Road and Track recently commented that after complaining about the Corvette seats for decades, they decided to improve them themselves by replacing them with milk crates. How the Corvette can be GM's showpiece and have an interior that look like it was put together by a committee of blind fools is beyond me. When I had my 911 and invited my brother in law for a ride, he refused to get out. The union card was dangerously close to being shredded. GM does make some cheap cars so if you like them and they keep you out of the poorhouse, good for you. My strategy has been to buy quality and keep my cars for 8-10+ years. I have no regrets. "

I found the &#145;Sport Seats&#146; ( included in 2LT & 3LT ) both more supportive & more comfortable &#150; as well as more widely adjustable. For the performance delivered, I believe that the Corvette offers excellent value.Just my opinion.- RayCurrent German car = BMW also provides me with excellent value . . . "
"wireless","October 2012"," I have a MB as well as a Chevy Trailblazer and a Toyota Sienna. I like the Chevy the best. My wife drives the MB. Don't care for the Sienna. Last time I was at the Toyota dealership I looked at their cars - the interiors are atrocious. Talk about plastic cheapness! Glad I got my '05 before they shaved every penny.The MB is nice, a real performance vehicle (C350) everything cool about it. I could go on and extol its virtues.Personally I like my Chevy TB best. Seats comfortable, interior okay, vehicle is tough, it just feels right. If I were buying a new car right now I'd be in the market for one of the US big three (if we can still include Chrysler in that designation). "
"graphicguy","October 2012"," Mark....good summation. I loved reading Bob Lutz's book about his days with GM. It was quote eye opening and gave a very clear view why GM had the poor reputation that they've endured over the last few decades (can't believe I just said decades, but there it is).They never really set out to build better cars. They set out to just build ones that they coule drive out cost...in engineering, materials, build, etc. The result is what we see today. They keep claiming they're getting better. But, it's hard to see where that is the case. And, it won't be until they change their culture.Since the ATS was brought up here, look at what the trade rags say about Cadillac's ""CUE"" system. Yes....Cadillac can say they have ""tech"" like the other manufacturers. But, it's so poorly implemented that it's rendered practically unusable.This attitude vs the Japanese or German manufacturers is what denigrates U.S. car companies the most (although, most Ford vehicles I've been in for rentals seem quite competitive).GM can't hit the BMW or Audi in handling without making the ride harsh. Same can be said for Infiniti. Acura seems to do a decent job, once you understand you're going to suffer some torque steer with FWD bias.Audi and BMW spend money to use better materials for their suspensions. It shows when you drive one. Even the Cadillac CTS I drove (again as a rental), as good is it purported to be, couldn't match the solidity of my BMW's doors when they shut. And, this was a Cadillac with less than 3K miles on it.Hell......BMW actually has a dept that studies and chooses the most pleasant bells/buzzes to use when a door is ajar. Think GM would spend money for that?I haven't driven a Lincoln in a long time, so I don't know how they compare. The last Chrysler 300 I drove (previous gen) wasn't all that impressive...especially from a build and material quality perspective.How long with my BMW last? Or, my GF's S4? I really don't know. The BMW is only coming up on its 2 year birthday. It's as solid now, and probably performs better than the day it came off the dealer's lot. The S4 seems to be in the same category.Only time will tell.As Mark says, as good as the TL SH AWD is, she wasn't the marrying type. "
"habitat1","October 2012"," Let me add to your comments another perspective which I gained from my recent trip to Spartanburg and tour of the BMW X3/X5/X6 factory.American workers can build great vehicles. They do it there every day in Spartanburg. From what I could see, they are hard working, passionate, proud, and happy as heck to have a decent paying job with good benefits. But BMW is not hamstrung in South Carolina like GM is in Detroit or Flint with the UAW fighting them tooth and nail every step of the way. The unions are not fully to blame for the demise of GM, Ford And Chrysler. But they have a big share of responsibility in the ""culture"" of mediocrity as you put it. And the counterproductive work rules that constantly create a management vs. labor battle are not doing any of us potential customers a damn bit of good. I wasn't allowed to bring a camera into the BMW factory. But if I could have, I could post 50 pictures of a factory floor clean enough to eat off of, robots doing the jobs that made engineering sense to turn over to precise machinery, assembly line workers busting their humps to do the jobs that required human dexterity, visual inspection and care. And the best pictures would have been of several of those workers looking up and giving me the thumbs up as we passed by their stations. I recieved at least a half dozen ""thank you's"" for having bought a X5d. Made me proud to have ""bought American"". "
"graphicguy","October 2012"," habitat....for a couple of years, when I first graduated college, I worked for GM (Fisher Body Plant outside of Cincinnati). I was doing coding for some very rudimentary robotics machines. I was salary. But, some of the same people I went to college with, left their ""degreed jobs"" to work for GM as an hourly employee at this same plant because they out earned me by as much as 40% (overtime).Because of wildcat strikes, work slowdowns, unreliability of those rudimentary ""robots"" I was coding for, I made the leap to hourly work, too.You're dead on in describing the ever present friction between the UAW and Management. I saw it from both sides, since I had worked both sides of that aisle. I saw foreman verbally abuse hourly workers (to the point of being as abusive as I've seen two humans could possibly be). In turn, I saw hourly workers sabotage machinery and ruin body parts (which were eventually shipped to an assembly plant) to retaliate.This was in the '80s. And, that plant eventually closed down. I know there was a lot of bitterness at that particular plant. Don't know if that exists today, or not. It certainly wasn't conducive to quality car building. And, GM wasn't all that concerned about quality. They were quite focused on quantity, though. Again, something that shows in their products.By contrast, I have toured Honda's plant in Marysville, OH, and the Subaru plant in IN. As you describe Spartanburg, these plants were clearly as clean as a pin. And, there is a spirit of cooperation, not distrust, disinterest, and uncooperativeness. I firmly believe that's why Toyota's, Hondas, Audis and as you point out, BMW enjoys the reputation for engineering superiority, build and material quality they do. They design better products, they make better products, because they plan to. And they make certain anyone who works for/with them do, too.I heard someone make apoint on one of the radio auto shows a while back that the reason German cars are expensive to keep is because there aren't enough mechanics around who are willing enough to understand how the cars are built and engineered. So, the dealerships get to charge whatever they want. "
"m6user","October 2012"," Since Audi stepped up to pay #1, 3, 4, & 5 under warranty (or goodwill extended warranty), I have no issues at all. I'd consider this stellar performance, reliability, and durability. I think part of the disagreement on reliability is due to perspective. I had a car for 13 years that I ended up giving to kars for kids. I loved that car which was one of the reasons I kept it so long. I always considered it a reliable car because, after all, I was never stranded nor did it ever need to be towed. However, after donating it I went through the maint folder I kept on it and soon realized something surprizing, that car had a lot of repairs and I put a lot of time and money into it because of those repairs. It would have made your list seem short in comparison. That said, based on my experience over the last ten years, you list looks very less than ""stellar"" from my perspective. I just traded a 2002 Infiniti with 98k in that only needed two actual repairs during it's lifetime with me. A power antenna(which I didn't fix and traded in like that) and and an inexpensive exhaust pipe repair a couple of years ago. So, you call your experience with your Audi stellar and I would not agree. To me that's a lot of repairs including some things that should last the life of the car without a problem. My whole point is not to put down any brand but to explain that our love for our vehicles can sometimes make us blind to the obvious compared to someone else looking at the same picture. "

"flightnurse","October 2012"," The unions are not fully to blame for the demise of GM, Ford And Chrysler. But they have a big share of responsibility in the ""culture"" of mediocrity as you put it.Habit if you could place the blame on a scale (0-10), where would you place the auto workers blame? An 8? Last year when the Fox New channel in Detroit caught those Chrysler workers drinking and smoking pot on their lunch breaks, this was not something that just started, as you stated it was part of the culture, the attitude was,we have a union so we wont get fired. The culture for many years at the Big 3 was ""who cares"" granted this attitude came from the top down. Now to turn things around from ""Who Cares"" to ""We Care"" takes times, usually between 5-7 years to change the culture at a large corporation, Ford has done it I believe 2013 will the year in which you see a whole different company. Chrysler was beyond help, and the Government knew it, that is why they were looking for someone to buy them, however, in the short amount of time, a turn around has happened, I can tell you this, the new Generation 300 is light years ahead from before, the materiel's are better, and the fit and finish is first rate. Does Chrysler has work to do to shake off its' bad image, yup, but they are working in the right directions. GM, has work to do, but they have started, I have rented a couple of Chevy Cruze's and was impressed with how it was put together, the new Malibu is a step forward and the new Impala too. I'm looking forward to driving them.American's can build great cars, but the workers have to want to, it is that simple, the workers for BMW, VW, Nissan are well taken care of, have great benefits and they are happy, that is the key to a successful workforce. "
"dino001","October 2012"," Lutz was a classic Detroit's executive. Full of excuses and self satisfaction. I ultimately blame the management for the failure, much more than the unions (75%-25%), just because those guys were paid to be in charge and, if all else failed, they should have busted the militant union gangsters - but they chose easy solutions and collected nice bonus for doing nothing.What did we hear instead? Lutz said ""we did not have enough cash in the bank to withstand a strike and the union had strike fund for longer than our cash"". And whose fault is that? You know it's a war, the other side made it clear, they won't relent. If so, you get the guns and ammunition for a siege, bonuses come after you win the war, not when you sign a capitulation. "
"andres3","October 2012"," I always considered it a reliable car because, after all, I was never stranded nor did it ever need to be towed. However, after donating it I went through the maint folder I kept on it and soon realized something surprizing, that car had a lot of repairs and I put a lot of time and money into it because of those repairs. It would have made your list seem short in comparison. Well which is it, is my list long or short? :P I consider my list short and insignificant because several of the items are very low cost / low labor fixes. Some of them are really things I was just nitpicky about (like the lid to the storage bin and the rear cupholders which are never used anyway). None of these issues stranded me or required a tow truck. That is a big deal. My '95 Dodge required 4 tow truck trips in 65K miles. The Audi has gone 92K with none; that's stellar in my book. The Honda went 65K without a single tow truck trip as well, then I sold it. It did however, require a new transmission at 42K (covered by Honda in goodwill). But at least it was able to limp into the dealership on it's own power.Both the Honda and Audi were extremely well built high quality cars, and it showed. The Dodge was poorly built and engineered, and it showed (4 tow trucks afterall). Goodwill when something did UNEXPECTEDLY go wrong, very present with both Honda and Audi. Goodwill from Dodge or Chrysler when stuff did go EXPECTEDLY wrong??; non-existent!That makes a huge difference! Yes, liking the car makes a big difference, but having the breakdowns covered by the manufacturer (sometimes requiring them to STEP UP TO THE PLATE), makes an even BIGGER difference in your perceptions. Not requiring tow trucks helps a lot too. Also, it's important to put the severity of the issues in perspective as well (as you can easily have 6 minor repairs cost less than 1 major one).Out of my own personal 3 cars so far in my lifetime, only one has had the AC last longer than 53K miles, and that's the Honda. Only one has had the transmission last longer than 60K miles, and that's the Audi. Also, take into consideration I actually drive my cars. I drive them hard and expect a lot out of them. The Audi has been driven the hardest by far (easily by 500%). None of the others faced this, the Audi inspired me to take it out on spirited weekend backroad country canyon carving drives, an autocross event or two, and have tracked it 5 or 6 weekends. The Honda or Dodge never inspired me to drive for the sake of driving. The Audi awoke the enthusiast within me.  "

"laurasdada","October 2012"," '09 Jaguar XK Coupe. Beautiful, great ride/handling balance, powerful, relatively economical and seats 4! Ahem... :blush: Approaching 32k miles, three warranty issues (anything electrical related expected, no surprise. The Prince of Darkness followed Jag to Ford):Replaced Audio Control Module to fix disappearing AM radio (at the time, needed AM to listen to the Sox games. Hindsight, shoulda just left it offline.)Replaced Nav System. Almost everytime I entered an address, the system would reboot. Other than that, worked fine. Replace/repair the AC outflow tube. Too close to the exhaust, melted shut. Passenger footwell filled with condensation on a road trip. Good one, Jaguar!The two electrical fixes were plug and play module replacements, no biggie. The AC fix, I saw the Jag in the shop, not a pretty site. But, I found out later, there was a TSB, all is well now. Loaner car was Land Rover LR2, which was good to experience. Now I know I will never buy a LR2. I had hoped for an XF or XJ, but alas, no. (When my TL was in for service, I always asked for the loaner NSX. But, wouldn't you know, every time they had just loaned it out before I got there!)No issues since. I'm a sucker for leather and wood and I'm surrounded by it. Bowers and Wilkins audio, just lovely. And, the exhaust note:  . The touch screen? Slow, clunky, gen 1.0. Luckily some redundant controls on the center stack and (heated, new favorite option) steering wheel. You get used to it.As I consider myself more of a GT guy than a true sports car guy (as of this writing), this car is near perfect for me. Except for the pesky don't go in snow thing...Went to the Jag Drive Alive experience, what a good time! Open to all, free. Nothing but R models of the XF, XJ and actually XKR-S in all it's 550hp glory. You get to drive each and every one, the XKR-S on a drag strip. Oh, my goodness. Swag, food, a bunch of professional drivers riding shotgun and followed up a few weeks later with a coupon good for up to $5k off a Jag. Holding out for an F-Type coupe.Love the car, father's friend had a red E-type convertible back in the late '60s, never forgot it. Of course, my kids don't like the XK, because, well, I spent their tuiton money on it. :shades: Kidding of course. Emptied my 401k!BTW, traded an '05 Acura TL for the Jag. Loved the TL, 6.5 years, 85k miles not an issue to report. Like the Jag, handsome, nicely appointed, great ride/handling balance, really seats 4 or more! And, not fabulous in the snow. I chose the TL over the Infiniti G back in '05 as the TL was just more refined, more GT to me. Too each, you can argue all you want about which car is better/better built/more reliable/fun etc. But until you put your $ down, it's all talk. Fun, interesting talk (when friendly).I've owned Japanese, European and even a domestic (Chrylser! 300M. Enjoyed it). Japanese easily most set it and forget it. But, the Saab, BMW and Jag ain't been too bad. Although the Bimmer is only a year old... Even the 300M had no out of warranty issues. But, at 67k miles, I wasn't taking chances and traded it for the TL.The Jag? Just a special piece of aluminum, wood and leather. Well done. But, where do I go from here? "
"flightnurse","October 2012"," Thanks for the write up dada... I have always like Jag's like you the E type, but mine was with the V12...

"flightnurse","October 2012"," Guess what, I don't think Infiniti is trying to clone a BMW 3I'll have to disagree with you on this. Here is what Road and Track wrote in the first paragraph of their article/comparison of the ATS and 3 series.The BMW 3 Series isn't just a car. As my cohort Jonny Lieberman likes to say, the 3 Series is a segment. Now, this isn't an attempt to stoke BMW's ego, or, as many of our readers would assume, bias towards the Bavarian brand. It's just the simple truth: When an automaker chooses to compete in the luxury sports sedan segment, it's benchmarking the 3 Series. No BMW has consistently won Motor Trend comparison tests like the 3 Series has, and for good reason. The 3 Series has come to define BMW's Ultimate Driving Machine mantra and embodies the purest qualities BMW stands for as a brand. R&T said it best, if you are going to build a sport sedan, than you are going to be compared to a 3 series. I do not remember reading that Infiniti was not trying to build their version of a 3 series. We all know that over the years, the 3 series hasn't lived up to its reputation, however, it continues to be picked over the others., first C&D and now R&T have picked the 3 series as a winner, as I stated before, if GM can fix the short comings of the ATS, they have the best shot of taking the win from BMW. "
"m6user","October 2012"," Can't say that I am shocked by the disagreement. You just don't get it. I already mentioned that Infiniti was benchmarking the 3 and that it was a compliment to BMW. Benchmarking is not necessarily an attempt to copy but to strive for similar(not exactly the same) results. Nobody is saying any car is overall better than the 3 in this segment. Just saying there are viable competitors that may be better for some people that don't need the epitome of driving dynamics and care more about other things. If Infiniti was trying to clone a 328 which is what it was price competitive with they could have given it 240hp instead of 325hp and called it a day. They chose a different route. Does a car have to be a clone of something else to compete in this category. Not everyone wants a BMW...plain and simple. I just wrote a check for 40k for a new Acura. I could just have well written one for a BMW or even more. But I really don't want one. I have nothing against BMW....it's the owners that are obnoxious sometimes.I do not remember reading that Infiniti was not trying to build their version of a 3 series.Kind of hard to prove a negative now isn't it? Do you also not remember them saying they were? "

"tlong","October 2012"," Andres, I had a '98 A4 and I kept it for 88K miles. It wasn't a disaster but it wasn't fabulous, either. The radio volume acted up. The sunroof track cracked and was replaced under warranty. The worst problem was the cooling problem where the temp would start moving way up while climbing hills on a hot day. Many visits to the dealer on my dime while they tried the fan clutch, the thermostat, the radiator, etc. Over $1K on repairs and still not really fixed.Yet I LOVED that car for its interior and its driving. I now own an '05 TL and yet I still miss the Audi. But let me tell you that at 128K on the TL, my only repairs were a OAT temp sensor recall and replacing a couple of door handle trims that fell off. Oh, and the right window regulator sometimes sticks. That's it. So I wouldn't call your Audi experience all that good, certainly not against the best of the Japanese brands. But I totally get the commitment to the German cars. When I own German I wish I had Japanese reliability. When I own Japanese I miss the German experience.Sigh. "
"graphicguy","October 2012"," Maybe the auto crisis during the recession turned GM around once and for all. Maybe the new Cadillacs really are world class cars, with world class build, materials and performance. Only time will tell. But, given past history, it's not like we haven't heard this story before.At the end of the day, both management and the UAW have to cooperate. If not, you end up with more Azteks than CTSs.Personally, I'm anxious to see the new TL, if/when it is released. The news that trickles out seems to point to a gas/electric built for performance.Until then, we're really enjoying our German rides.Speaking of Jags......my sister has an S-Type that has to be close to 10 years old. Not a single blip. She's looking at replacing it with an XF. "
"habitat1","October 2012"," I agree with much of what you say. And, in fact, In 2004 I bought a TL 6-speed that was even less than a clone of a 3 series than the G35. I got a fun to drive ""sporty"" (vs. sport) sedan that had more room for the family, good ergonomics and technology, and excellent reliability.But....I would still contend that part of infiniti's problem is self inflicted. They themselves tried to compare the g35 to the 3 series in marketing materials. And by producing a coupe version that is essentially a refined 370z with a back seat, they were clearly hoping to win the comparison on performance and driving dynamics.You can keep contending that they are a viable alternative for other reasons and attributes. I agree. But flight can also contend that, unlike the TL or Lexus ES, the G set itself up for and encouraged a more direct comparison to the 3 series on those attributes that fell short.The G is what it is and people can and do buy it based ( hopefully) upon the actual attributes.

"wireless","October 2012"," ""I would like to think that's true, but it seems it's an epidemic of lazy people who have or take no pride in their own work.""Actually at the BMW plant in Greenville SC they don't hire ""lazy"" people.

"graphicguy","October 2012"," m6user....I think Infiniti marketed/positioned the G as competition for the BMW 3 series. Problem with that is, BMW is a moving target. They keep upping the ante, sometimes in as little as major upgrades happening every 2-3 model years.So, Infiniti is left competing on price, instead......""almost"" as good as a BMW, but at a lesser price. Nothing wrong with that. Ask any small business person how that works out. You must have very large quantity of scale to compete on price. Out of all the parameters any company wants to use as a competitive advantage, price would rank at the very bottom. "
"m6user","October 2012"," I don't disagree at all that Infiniti tried to be closer to a BMW 328 than either Lexus or Acura and marketed itself as such. What I don't agree with is that Infiniti was trying to copy exactly the experience of driving a BMW 3. I really don't pay much attention to manufacturer press release info or commercials as that is just hype.IMO the G has some attributes(MPG not being one, it sucks and another reason I did not buy) that are better than the 3 which I think (most) everyone can agree on ie. power, interior sophistication, low(long term) maint. and repairs. In other ways it is about equal ie resale value, dealer experience. The area where it and just about every Asian or American car falls short is in the suspension, steering gear and weight distribution which gives the BMW such a dynamic driving experience that hasn't been duplicated. But I also argue that the vast majority of people buying the 3 don't use, need or appreciate that driving dynamic as they lease their auto(like over 90% take rate) tranny ""beemers"" to impress. And that comment was not meant to insult the true enthusiasts that buy it for the drive and not the show. So if you take that factor away as a real draw then things equal out a bit more. The new ATS is apparently very close and maybe better in some respects from the reviews that I've read but it is too new to really even form an opinion on yet. Although I'm sure many BMW fanboys have pretty much written if off already. "
"m6user","October 2012"," So, Infiniti is left competing on price, insteadDisagree. I won't repeat for the nth time some of the attributes of the G that can compete with the BMW besides just price but suffice to say that it has things that people look for in a ELLPS besides just price. I do agree that there is nothing wrong with being second best at a lesser price if you have a business model that makes a profit by doing it. Agreed that if ALL you are going to sell on is price than huge scale is necessary but as I've already said, I don't believe that is the case with Infiniti. Street prices for the G are much less than the 3 but so are just about every other comparable car out there. When you have the cache you can price high. That's capitalism. "

"habitat1","October 2012"," I think we agree more than not, and I never said nor meant to suggest that Infiniti was trying to copy the BMW 3 with the G. And I agree with you that there are many attributes by which to compare these cars, both performance related and non-perforamcne related. That said, I am not sure how you conclude that the G is ""better"" than the 3 with respect to power. In just about every road test I've seen, the 335i is anywhere from a couple to quite a few ticks faster than the G37 in a straight line. Here's one source if you go down to the Infiniti header and check out the comparison test with the TL SH-AWD, 335i and S4. If anyone has the upper hand on the 335i in measured performance it's Audi. But even I would argue that there are subjective things about the Audi I don't like - nose heavy, heavy heavy, AWD vs. RWD - all lead to a somewhat less nimble feeling than I prefer. Can't dispute the fact that they post great numbers, just don't like the subjective feel of how Audi gets there. I'd say the same thing about a Porsche 911 C4S vs. C2S. TL vs. 335 vs. G37 vs. S4 "
"m6user","October 2012"," I conclude it by comparing the G to the 328 which I specifically stated in my post. IMO the G and 328 are the respective ELLPS models and at about the same entry MSRP. A 335 with leather, etc is about $10k more. I use leather at it's standard in the Infiniti. The base TL and the sh-awd TL is a similar situation but the price difference isn't as substantial. Same with the A4 vs. S4. The 328, TL, G, A4 all are about the same starting MSRP I believe. "

Porsche borrowed that Audi feature, re-packaged it as an option, and now calls it ""launch control"" in their 911's equipped with their PDK transmission. Although for some reason it doesn't work in ""Park"" anymore, you actually have to be in ""Drive"". Pretty amazing that Audi managed to stay afloat after all of the bad press and class action lawsuits. I had a business associate that bought an Audi 5000 just before the poop hit the fan and his pregnant wife demanded he sell the car less than six months later. Don't remember the exact figures, but he got less than half what he paid for it and it only had 3,000 miles on the odometer. Audi later sent him a $10,000 coupon to be able to use on a future purchase as a ""sorry"", but he let that expire and still hasn't been back to an Audi showroom since. "

Humans will forever blame their equipment and their machinery for their own human mistakes and errors. Early this year in the NFL a player went to spike the football right after catching a touchdown, and the football flew out of his hand so that he had an empty hand spike motion going on; what did he do?

"alltorque","October 2012"," I think the thing to remember is that the North American market was a very small part of Audi's empire at the time of the alleged 5000 problem, (whether that was electro-mechanical, human stupidity - or worse), and probably still is. A poor name in one - at the time small market - doesn't mean a company is destined for the scrap heap, as evidenced by their continued success worldwide.Here in Europe I believe the 5000 was badged as a 200 and was highly regarded, i.e. the 100's big brother. I don't recall any similar incidents over here, at the time or since, with Audi cars. I don't drive an Audi; never owned one as I believe they are over-priced VWs in pretty dresses. I much prefer my VWs dressed as Skodas for many reasons, not just price but also better build quality and dealerships. However, Audi have been building fine cars for a long time and, if you must have the badge and are prepared to part with the money, then why not ?Interesting that Audi are a relative newcomer to the high-end market, (or any market), unlike Skoda who have been around for considerably longer and even survived the disaster that was East European Communism. The original Skoda Superb was a competitor for Rolls Royce et al in it's day. Try the Googly thing to see about it. The current Skoda Superb puts Audi to shame in the value department, (and quite a few others, also). But I doubt it's coming your way in the foreseeable future.............VAG aren't stupid.

"habitat1","October 2012"," They continue to grow, advance, and head in the right direction moreso than other car manufacturers in my opinion.I'd generally agree, except they have a severe weight problem. Partly because all of their performance models are AWD, but also because they appear to think weight isn't an issue. You know, the ""big is beautiful"" denial syndrome. The Q7 is a half ton more than the Porsche Cayenne and not as big inside as the 700 lb lighter MDX. An Audi TT is about the same weight as a Porsche Cayman - with a water buffalo sitting in the passenger seat. BMW's 5 series has bloated up as well, but the Audi A6 is heavier yet.I think they need to add some calisthenic instructors to their engineering department. "
"ivan_99","October 2012"," An Audi TT is about the same weight as a Porsche Cayman - with a water buffalo sitting in the passenger seat.A baby buffalo?I see the TT only a couple hundred lbs over the Cayman; not too bad since its AWD and has a couple pretend seats for small children. 3153 lbs isn't that bad. "
"habitat1","October 2012"," 3153 lbs isn't that bad.It is when it is attached to a their below entry level 211 hp engine. The fair comparisons are:Cayman S (320 hp) @ 2,976 lbs vs. TTS Coupe (265 hp) @ 3,219 lbs = +243 lbs; -55 hp Boxster S (315 hp) @ 2,910 lbs vs. TTS Roadster (265 hp) @3,394 lbs = +484 lbs; -50 hp911S Coupe (400hp) @ 3,075 lbs vs. TT RS Coupe (360 hp) @3,306 lbs = +231 lbs; -40 hpPorsche is redesigning the Cayman S along the lines of the new Boxster, so its weight is anticipated to drop another 80-100 lbs for 2013. Again, my point isn't that Audi doesn't make some great cars. They absolutely do. I particularly like the S5 and A7/S7. But the added weight (and AWD) makes Audi's so-called sports cars and sport sedans feel much less nimble than I would prefer. They get decent straight line performance, but, as Clint Eastwood might say, they have ""trouble with the curves"". At least in imparting the same kind of nimble feel and driving pleasure. Considering that my 1995 5 passenger Nissan Maxima SE tipped the scales at 3,001 lbs, I'd really like to see similar sized offerings by Audi and BMW try to stay in the 3,500 lb range. That gives them an extra 500 lbs for more safety equipment, stronger frame and chassis (although my Maxima was as solid at 150k miles as it was new), and techno do-dads. But 4,000 lbs for a mid size sedan is just too much, IMO. Hell, Porsche has now got their Cayenne down to under 4,400 lbs; surely they can lend a weight reduction engineer to Audi for a few weeks. "
"plekto","October 2012"," It gets even worse if you look at their torque differences and the RPM curves. But then again, Porsche has built the best small cars for decades. You kind of expect them to make great things. "

For extra 20-50 grand anybody can throw in extra engineering and lightweight materials and horsepower. And even mighty Porsche couldn't lightend its Carrera 4 (AWD) version - 3150 to 3197 lb, making it below 200 lb differential against Audi at 50 grand more.Audi should be compared to similarly priced vehicles to comparison make sense. Weight is money, for hundred grand I sure would expect a sports coupe to be 300 lbs. lighter. Just like if one pays 100 grand for a luxury sedan, they should expect stuff, they would not find in a 30 thousand family ""fully loaded"" sedan. "

At least BMW, AUDI, and Porsche try and make an effort, can't say the same for everyone.On the plus side, my A3 is much quieter than a Mazda 3 regarding road noise (sound dampening) and the Mazda feels tinny and thin in comparison (particularly the sheet metal seemed dent prone). I would take the Audi in a crash or accident any day, so their are some advantages to the heft, but I would like to see cars get lighter in general. "
"habitat1","October 2012"," I feel compelled to point out, that, yes, but the TTRS has smoked the Cayman R (the fair comparison) around any track they've both been measured on, despite any weight disadvantages, or so-called ""trouble with the curves."" I feel compelled to point out that you're wrong: Nordschleife Lap TimesAs you can see scrolling down, the Audi TT RS Coupe is 8:09 and the (old) Cayman R was 8:06. But even more impressive is the new 2013 Boxster S, which has come in at 7:58. With the weight reduction and chassis improvements, I expect the new Cayman being somewhere between that time and the 7:37 posted by the new Carrera S. My bet would be 7:48 for the Cayman S.But I don't need to go to Germany with a racing helmet to form my personal opinion. Even with moderately vigorous test drives, I have felt the weight and bulk of Audi's. For a big luxury sedan like the A8, not a problem. For an A6, a little more so, for the S5, it didn't feel as nimble as a 335is or M3. The TT S (I haven't driven the RS), was not as rewarding to drive as my old S2000, let alone a Boxster S or Cayman. It has a great looking interior and probably is the most comfortable with cruise control on at 75 mph on the highway, but that's not the top of my priority list for a sports car. BTW, I am even more critical of the BMW Z4. The make a great diesel SUV, as my garage can attest. But not a very compelling so-called sports car.I understand Audi has elected to go with AWD as their preferred performance drivetrain. It certainly beats FWD to death. But it adds weight and takes away the nimbleness of RWD when you get into the sport sedan, coupe and sports car categories, IMO. I'd make the same claim relative to Porsche. Give me a GT3 over a 911 Turbo any day. Or if you are feeling really generous, a GT2.P.S. Price vs. Weight. Yes, I agree with a previous post that Porsche has a few more engineering dollars to spend to squeeze out more weight. The point I am making is that right now, Audi doesn't seem to think that weight is a problem, period. That's an attitude issue, not a cost one. "
"flightnurse","October 2012"," Apples and oranges. Complaining about extra 200-300 poundsWhen creature comforts started taking over cars, they will get heavier. back up camera's, Nav system, Infiniti adjustment power seats, quieter highway cruising.) Also look at the safety equipment that cars have to have, air bags, safety glass etc..Of course car companies can build the extra light weight sport car with no thrills Honda S2000, Cayman R (2855lbs) or how about the Honda/Acrua NSX (2975lbs) Porsche knew what lightweight was in 73-74 when they built the 911 RS 2175 lbs (this was the SL (superlight) weight)...The question do car companies want to build them? BMW had the The BMW M3 CSL (Coup? Sport Leichtbau) weight 3050lbs (light for BMWs) I'm sure BMW could have shaved off an extra 200lbs from the car, but elected not to. Wouldn't be nice to be able to buy a BMW 3M coupe, at 2800 lbs, making 330hp, or better yet, just a 3 series sedan or coupe CSL... "
"habitat1","October 2012"," When I read your reference to the 911 RS, I realized that I'm probably guilty of taking this discussion too far for the ELLPS forum. I had originally responded to another post suggesting that Audi is in the engineering leadership position. I agreed that, while they make some very nice cars, they could use a dose of attitude adjustment and make weight loss a higher priority. Across the board. That doesn't mean I think they should shoot to compete with 1970's vintage sports cars. But almost every vehicle they have now competes for the title of ""heaviest in the segment"". The Q7 was by several hundred pounds the heaviest SUV we considered - even though it has a smaller interior than the MDX. That excessive weight made it feel slow and ponderous handling compared to the X5d, Cayenne and even their sister Toaureg (which is no lightweight either). Lost sale relative to us, given that it is otherwise a fine vehicle. We can take up on another sports car board whether Audi has been too pig-headish on maintaining AWD as their only drivetrain on their TTS, S4/S5 and other performance models. But you will never get a TT anything to feel as tight, sharp and visceral as my old S2000 with the extra weight of a water buffalo in the passenger seat. Maybe a juvenile buffalo, but a buffalo all the same. "
"victor23","October 2012"," Blame not car companies. Blame our litigious culture resulting in the heavy (literally) safety mandates (often overkill or just nonsensical). Blame also a dumb consumer car culture where cupholders and stereo take precedence over driving dynamics even in the so-called ""enthusiast"" segment. "
"m6user","October 2012"," The ""creature comforts"" of nav, power windows/locks, power seat adjusters, soundproofing add very little weight in relation to the manual systems they replaced. Especially with todays mini electronics and motors. Soundproofing is not the heavy stuff of bygone years either. The culprit in weight gain is safety systems in response to federal regulation and insurance industry standards AND the overall size of the vehicle. While you can add high strength steel in the framing and aluminum hoods, etc which can save a few pounds, physics will not be denied and the weight goes up somewhat relative to the increase in the size of vehicles. Just look at tires. My first car had 13"" and even 16""s were large throughout the 90s. Now the the standard is about 17"" with 18""s pretty common as well. Can't tell me that these larger wheels and tires don't add significantly to the weight. "
"habitat1","October 2012"," I think that is mostly correct, but it would be interested to see where all the weight is if you pulled a couple of cars apart. Here's three I'd start with:1995 Maxima SE 5-speed manual: 3,001 lbs with 3.0 6 cylinder engine. Length 187.7 inches; width 69.3 inches. 2013 BMW 328i 6-speed manual: 3,360 lbs with 2.0 4 cylinder engine. Length 182.5 inches; width 71.3 inches. AWD/Automatic: 3,595 lbs.2013 Audi A4 FWD CVT: 3,509 lbs with 2.0 4 cylinder engine. Length 185.1 inches; width 72.2 inches. Quatro: 3,616 lbs.Wheels and tires have gone from 15"" 215 series on Maxima to 17"" 225-245 series on Audi/BMW. In fairness, the Maxima has gone up to 3,551 lbs, and is now 190.6 inches long and 73.2 inches wide. That's A6/535i size, both of which are pushing 4,000 lbs. Also, in spite of the greater exterior width of the A4 and 328 compared to the older Maxima, the interior width (shoulder/hip) is almost identical. Much of the exterior width difference is in flared fenders and design elements.I don't think we should go backwards in structural rigidity and crash worthiness. But I have to question how much that accounts for the significant weight increases since the mid 1990's. You can have very light safety cages that can withstand tremendous stresses, as Formula One proves.Oh well, I'm up about 10% in body weight since buying my 1995 Maxima. I'll get that down to 5% before I complain on this subject again. Hopefully, before Thanksgiving. "
"victor23","October 2012"," Sorry guys for my lack of precise knowledge, so please just bear with me. I think I remember reading somewhere that the reinforced cages added weight significantly (new materials notwithstanding, or maybe because of their higher costs?); in particular, new requirements on the roof strength in case of rollover raised the center of mass and changed the vehicle balance and handling, which in turn was one of the reasons to mandate the electronic stability control. FWIW. I don't know about you, but I would take an active safety over passive any day. I am concerned much more about the capacity of the car to outmaneuver and avoid an accident than about it saving my a** when the accident happens. You are right about tires, but maybe the difference is less than it appears from the rim diameters. The overall wheel diameter is probably not much more that it used to be. In the past, high-aspect passenger tires were the norm, while now low-profile (such as 45-50) tires are ubiquitous even in the ""family"" sedan category. "
"markcincinnati","October 2012"," Regarding your observation that ""Audi has been too pig-headish about maintaining AWD . . . on their . . . performance models."" I have no real proof (other than what I read in Car & Driver, et al) of my observation that Audi has built its reputation on AWD (at least in the US, if not elsewhere) and it has, of course, marketed itself, trademarked, copyrighted, and probably patented its ""image"" (if possible) on quattro and ""The Four Intersecting Rings.""Audi has labored and fought hard to be equated with ""quattro"" just as a famous cola manufacturer has fought hard to be called Coke; or as hard as a tissue manufacturer has fought to be called Kleenex.If Audi reverted to FWD instead of AWD several things would happen and not many of them would be good (at least from both marketing and performance perspectives). And there is no way I [at least] could ever imagine Audi marketing RWD cars -- any more than Coke wants any cola product to be called coke (with a little ""c"").Audi would also probably point to near premium, premium, and super premium (and exotics, too) cars that are all-wheels-driven vehicles.Several of the world's greatest automakers save AWD for their highest performing models. Perhaps AWD is in Porsche's blood what with Audi, VW and Porsche all being related. Perhaps Lamborghini too has AWD in its blood due to Lamborghini's relationship with Audi. The same for Bentley. Audi would probably argue that AWD is their performance vehicles' ""secret"" [not really secret, of course] weapon or sauce as the analogy might go.I love the use of the phrase ""pig-headish"" -- and assume it was meant to be ironic or at least be a double entendre since Audis are ""front end"" (or head end, as opposed to butt end) heavy.I just don't see Audi doing anything else than continuing to embrace AWD -- especially for its highest performing cars. :shades: "
"flightnurse","October 2012"," Victor, litigious culture is correct, however, if car companies would build a super light version of a M3 or A4 in a small run to give the driver enthusiast what they want. I would have to say that i highly doubt the average BMW 3 series driver wanting to buy one of those, As stated before, you can have a light weight car, but do the car companies want to build them? When BMW built the M3 CSL it was sold out before the production run started, Porsche does not have a problem selling their Cayman R either. It seems selling the cars isn't a problem.. "
"habitat1","October 2012"," Perhaps AWD is in Porsche's blood what with Audi, VW and Porsche all being relatedThat will get the blood boiling with a lot of Porsche enthusiasts that are far more knowledgeable and much more proficient sports car drivers than me. I've been casually shopping for a replacement for my 911 C2S that I sold 18 months ago. In the process, I've attended a Porsche track event and test driven several cars, new and used. The conversations I've had with Porsche employees, enthusiasts, and professional drivers has been pretty educational. Bottom line, very few serious Porsche enthusiasts consider the 911 Turbo (AWD) to be the pinnacle of the 911 line. They put the GT3 RS4.0 on top, GT3 next followed by GT2. Some would put the new 991 C2S ahead of the 997 Turbo. They like naturally aspirated engines and RWD. The GT2 is the RWD answer to the Turbo S, and is fast as hell, but not preferred by them over the GT3. The AWD 911 Turbo and various ""4"" cars were, as explained to me, partly based off the fact that the 911 RWD has a front/rear weight balance of roughly 37/63 and some buyers liked having another 150+/- lbs over the front wheels and some extra grip. That was usually followed by a thinly veiled ""amateur"" adjective to further describe that type of buyer. But not the preference of the serious enthusiasts, it seems. As a matter of fact, I have heard from several that they have acquired 993 Turbos (last of the air cooled engines) and actually disconnected the front drive train to make them RWD. The Cayman and Boxster will never be AWD. They are already perfectly balanced and light. My pig headed comment was probably unfair. Audi has built quite a reputation on Quatro. But remember, they started out as FWD, which is the worst of all worlds, so AWD was really a necessity if they didn't want to fire all of their engineers and start over. A RWD TT RS is probably not in the works, and the fact that the heavier AWD TT RS has none of the feel and sharpness of a Cayman S or R is probably not important to the typical Audi customer. But it would be to a Porsche enthusiast. "

"dino001","October 2012"," Just got first service on my 328i wagon (E91) and got a 328i sedan (F30) loaner - first time around. Couple of first impressions, especially on those contentious issues:1. Boy, it got bigger. Not elephant yet, but it's basically equivalent to 5-series from two generations ago.2. The engine is quick. The car is faster than mine, noticeably - but I still like engine sound on mine. Just can't replace the six cylinders. Transmission - well, if I can't have a manual anymore, this automatic is doing really fine job, especially on sports mode.3. The start/stop feature is not such a satan's work, as some people want you to believe. Did not disturb me. Once you know it's there and you're prepared, it's fine.4. Steering is a disaster, especially low speeds/parking lot. The car feels like Buick and that's NOT a good thing. Highway speed (it's variable) is probably not as bad, but at low speeds the car definitely lost its sportiness.5. The seats are terrible. I have sports seats on mine and this loaner has standard seats. They are bulkier and seem a bit more solid than previous generation (it seems to be common complaint that 3-series seats go out of shape too quickly), but the thigh support is just atrocious. 20 minutes and it already hurt. Yes, I'm a heavy guy and even my sports seats get to me, but it takes them 300-400 miles before they do. This is probably single disqualifier to me. I hope they have sports seats option, for their sake.6. They eventually fixed the cupholders. Funny, we all make fun of the cupholder obsession, but I get in with my morning coffee and look for the old style holder (you know, that POS plastic thingy springing from the front trim) and it's not there. Getting quickly upset, then after a few seconds I realized they would not market one without cup holders, so it must be there - sure enough, the holders were covered with a neat plastic cover in front of the shifter. And boy, why it took them four generations to figure out the right place and size is beyond me.7. They kept most of the switches and knobs in same locations, so it was easy to find. However, some switches and iDrive have different feel on clicks - the clicks feel ""harder"", more plastickey, including iDrive. I think I like my old one better. Also radio switch was odd, I can turn it off by pressing, but to turn it on, I have to dial (in effect increase the volume) and couldn't get back to my previous volume level with one press. Really odd - don't know if I missed something, or if this is on purpose. 8. Overall dashboard look is just like mine - boring, unispiring and seems like they again have a 1 to 50 ratio of manhours for development of mechanical features vs. interior. The dials are as boring as mine, same with trim. Yes, it is all put together well, but they need to hire couple of Italian designers. I generally like simple, but there is simple/elegant and simple/basic. I think 3-series is the latter in many places. "

The brakes got bigger because the car got heavier..... Before I get rebuked - yes, I know that it would take about 1,000 shifts to burn enough calories to make up for the Snicker's bar or MacDonald French Fries. It's not the physical act of shifting that determines the width of one's butt. That's just the canary in the mine shaft of our mental attitudes. Not a sermon, just a thought. "
"graphicguy","October 2012"," dino....interesting observations. Can't disagree, although I absolutely hated the ""start/stop"" feature of the loaner I had. That said, it can be permanently defeated, so no harm, no foul.Like you, my biggest buggaboo are the seats. Unless you go with sport seats, at extra cost, the standard seats, even in my coupe, really aren't all that comfortable. The seat bottoms are flat and hard, with no thigh support.The only other ""quasi"" issue I have with the F30s is the protrusion of the nav system......it looks like an afterthought. I also agree that BMW did indeed do some cost cutting with the dials and knobs. You can tell the difference going from an E9X to an F30. "
"markcincinnati","October 2012"," I think we're basically in violent agreement. And Audis are nose heavy and overall fairly heavy cars. Yet, what we've not discussed is the fact that all of these car companies -- even the ones that are ""related"" (like Audi, Porsche and VW, et al) -- make whatever helps them meet their revenue, volume and profit objectives. Some time ago, a BMW owner told me, as he looked down on my Audi, that BMW would never produce anything other than RWD cars. I'd say we've pretty much incorporated X-drive across virtually all BMW's -- because they sell and because they make profit.Someone told me that Porsche would never make a CUV (or SUV) and would never create a sedan and that Porsche's were ""only"" about performance -- then the 944 came out.BTW there is a team of lawyers who look out for the use of coke (little c) -- they always want to see it as Coke. Likewise quattro is well, ""quattro"" not Quatro or Quattro -- the Audi legal team will, no doubt, be sending Edmunds a cease and desist demand if they allow us to post the brand incorrectly. Virtually all I see here in Cincinnati are AWD Porsches -- and I suspect the two Porsche dealers are happy as a clam in its shell to sell as many of them as they can get their hands on.For most mere mortals, living through even our ""moderate"" winters, AWD vehicles are more, dare I say, practical. The fact that some of the highest performing vehicles are offered in AWD trim is, for some, a bonus.Drive it like you live. :surprise: "
"dino001","October 2012"," Don't know the new Nav, the loaner doesn't have it. My old nav is OK when it comes to guidance (although it can get confused at times and there are some things I'd improve on the screen guidance), but it sucks when it comes to points of interest. Huge gaps in coverage, even on basic items, from lack of car parts stores (that may be by design) and search categories are botched. Lack of some basics, like pharmacy (had to go with either name or general). I think my old Garmin is generally better in terms of POI search and in par when it comes to guidance. I'm sure new Nav is probably improved a little, because the reference line is not as high. "
"dino001","October 2012"," I just experienced today what it means when you buy a premium brand vehicle. Well, I was prepared, as I have done my research, but still can't shake that feeling of being treated like a milking cow. So I get to this first ""free"" service that BMW tells you that ""all you pay is tires"", everything, everything is freee. Yeah, right. I get my ""advisor"" (who is basically a sales person) simply print out a piece of paper with $600 ""worth"" of service they ""recommend"" and casually saying like nothing that's what they're going to do. It is:- four wheel alignment (well, OK that may be a legitimate item for those concerned, but why isn't that covered than if all is supposed to so free, free, free): $200. WHAT???!!!! :mad: Market rate is between $50 (with coupon) and $80, I understand that's a premium place, but not at a tripple rate.- engine induction system cleaning. Yeah, right at 15K miles it's soooo dirty, especially when using a brand premium gas. I have never done one and I owned some perfomance cars, like STI. No thanks. BTW, price is also $200, a little over double of market.- power steering fluid flush. Really?? At 15K??? Are your serious??? Oh, also $200.Wow. So this is how ""free, free, super free"" service looks like - nice isn't it? Absolutely ridiculous, both in terms of ""recommendations"" and prices. I wonder how many poor saps would they scare into doing this. I told them to jump into the lake (in much nicer words, of course), and the ""advisor"" didn't even flinch, except he told me all that story about lost goodwill at beyond warranty (yes, I do plan to keep my car for longer, at least today). But when you count all those ""recommended"" services at those highly inflated prices, it's like paying for that good will, just up front. I'll do when it comes, got enough money for that. A coworker summarized it well - she said it's basically bying a friend.I already dread my next visit and ""advice"" at 30K. I hate those pitches. The sad part is that in the noise there can be something actually worth doing, but when you get hit for money just for the sake of it, I lose all trust to my ""advisor"" and have to work on my own what actually is worth doing and at what price. "
"nyccarguy","October 2012"," Thanks for the detailed write up on the new F30 328i. The more I read about the steering & driving dynamics from enthusiasts like you, the more it looks like my next car isn't going to be a new BMW. I agree with you that the way an engine sounds & the smoothness of how it delivers power are important to me as well. It doesn't get any better than our N52 Inline 6.How many miles are on your wagon? Do you need anything fixed (under warranty) or do they just need to do the service? I just hit 11,000 miles this AM & my OBC says I still have 4900 miles to go before I need my 1st service.I've got 3 minor issues that I'm holding out until the 1st service to bring it in for.(1) the panel gaps between the hood & the front fender (1/4 panel) are uneven. The driver's side is nice and tight, while the passenger side is noticeably wider to the naked eye. (2) when I first drive the car in the AM, while sitting at a long traffic light, the engine idle jumps up & down between 500 & 700 RPM. (3) When it is cold out (in the 40s & under), my trunk does not latch closed. I have to stick a key in the latch so it catches when I close it. "
"qbrozen","October 2012"," Do you have another dealer you can choose?Mine never suggested anything like that. "
"nyccarguy","October 2012"," That's awful! And he basically ""threatened"" you too about post warranty work. Nice dealership. "
"dino001","October 2012"," I put out (and got approved) a claim on a small (1/4"" in diameter) paint flakeoff at door handle lining (where the key housing used to be). It looked like a paint system defect (exposed primer, no trace of impact), not damage to me and they agreed. The car stays overnight at the shop, as they have to paint the new piece in my color. They also agreed to replace a torn door sill - it was me, hitting it hard every time I got out of the car, the sill split it two at point of those impacts, about 3 inch long split. I must admit, it was because the way I like to sit (lowest possible, as far as possible), combined with my weight and general clumsiness when getting out. Since I noticed the damage, I'm making more concerted effort to get out in a way avoiding this damage, but I still catch myself hitting the area once in a while. So I'm thankful for that - not expecing to get such consideration if keep banging this sill on next service, so I'll try to excercise more caution when getting out of the car.I also lost an undercarriage bumper for the lifts (it was discovered in a tire shop some time ago) - $69 to put it back. I'm OK with that. Other than that, the car is perfect. They'll replace the wipers (free). The mileage: 14,000. 12 months and three days since delivery in Munich. "
"dino001","October 2012"," From what I see, it's kind of ""standard"" here, but I may be wrong about that. Another dealer in Lakeland has their service prices posted - Still too high, for my taste, but a little but lower. But it's out of the way for me, much less convenient. And the whole loaner thing, I would have to ask what their position is on that if I wanted to switch.Like I said, otherwise, it's a pleasant experience  :sick: "
"habitat1","October 2012"," What's the name of your dealership, if I might ask?I am planning on stopping into mine later this week on our X5d to order the trailer hitch and spare tire kit (blew it, should have checked that box). We only have 1,400 miles on the vehicle, but I will be asking to speak to the service manager just to make sure we don't get hit with any of the BS you just went through. "
"andys120","October 2012"," I lose all trust to my ""advisor"" and have to work on my own what actually is worth doing and at what price.Mike Miller at Roundel (the BMW Car Club magazine) puts out a good comprehensive schedule of what maintenance is needed on various BMWs, it's free to BMWCCA members. You can also get similar ones at ""Bavarian Otto's"" blog on the Bavauto.com website.I have found that if you stick to these schedules you will get many trouble free miles from your car. They are a little more comprehensive than the maintenance BMWNA gives you but not as extensive as the extras your dealer is pushing at you. There's no way you need a P/S flush at 15K, you can go 100K without problems and that induction system cleaning is pure BS.If I were you I'd find another dealer for warranty work and a good Indie shop for everything else. "
"dino001","October 2012"," The name is Reeves. The sad thing about the whole thing is, their sales staff and creating a really good environment, trully friendly and no-nonsense, even if very aggressive on pricing, makes you feel comfortable. I'm generally not opposed to somebody setting whatever their price can be - it's free market and it is their choice to do so, as it is mine to use them or not (basically market sets those limits). I'm also cognizant that my car is one of cheapest they have out there, so the perspective is different - somebody with $100K 7-series may not care if alignment is $100 or $200, but they may care more about ""concierge"" type of service that you get in such a place. Those ""free"" perks can be quite costly. I don't need them, I'd rather keep my money, but again - they cater to people who do care and such a treatment costs money. Fine with me. I can't be angry at Ritz for their hotel room prices being out of what I'm willing to pay, so I'm not angry at Reeves for $200 alignment price. It's too high IMHO, so thanks, but no thanks. It's the other two ""recommendations"" that really bother me, because they are trully bogus in my opinion.I don't think you need to worry about anything at 1400 miles. This is not the case of somebody putting the car on the lift and then telling you your (fill the blank) is broken and has to be fix for X. This was planned maintenance visit used as an opportunity for an upsell, because they think that whatever BMW pays them is not enough. They invented a bogus need for some preventative stuff that don't really need, but nobody can disprove such need. I'm already used to that - every time you have an AC service as maintenance, the guy without a fault will ""recommend"" duct cleaning, coil cleaning and other equally ""preventative"" stuff, not to mention a UV lamp to kill bacteria with a bargain price of over two grand, or electrostatic filter for another two. All I need is to say no and they go away. "

"habitat1","October 2012"," So I went into Tesla today for my test drive of the Model S and to try to decide if I should convert my $5,000 deposit into a binding configuration. They can deliver the car in 90 days from whenever I hit the ""confirmed"" button. My quick take is that Tesla has a great vehicle for greenies, geeks and semi-enthusiasts that can will get excited by the 240 volt plug, 17"" touchscreen, or holding the steering wheel in both hands on a vigorous test drive........but, once you come to a stop and look around the interior of the car, you realize pretty quickly that you aren't sitting in a Panamera, CLS, A7, 5-series. I don't want my first impression to be too harsh, and intend to go back with my wife when she can do a test drive in the next week or two. But I think Tesla might have more of a packaging problem with the interior than their sexy photographs and YouTube videos suggest. The seats were Toyota Camry quality and the empty area below the dash and between the driver and passenger seat (where the gear shift and center console would normally be) looked awful and detracted from the sense that you were sitting in a high tech, high quality cockpit. Neither the car I test drove nor the other one in the showroom had the panorama sunroof. Too bad, because the headliner looked like it was poorly fitted and finished. Which was also the case with the leather on the showroom model's seats. Overall, other than the 17"" screen and dash, I was underwhelmed by the interior design, fit and finish. The test drive itself was much better. Car has good acceleration from a standstill, even the ""base"" model I drove. It was even more impressive going from 40 to 70 on the highway. I am sure the performance model is a hoot to drive. Handling felt very good but I didn't get a chance to really test it fully to be able to call it great. I need to go back again and stew on this before hitting that configure button. "
"nyccarguy","October 2012"," Yes it is. As of today, the 2 ELLPS manufacturers who do not equip their vehicles with electric power steering?Dino - funny you commented on our cars' cupholders. I have no problem with the cupholders in the E90. Holds my cup with no problems. When I don't make, there's always room for a DD medium or large w/ no issues.cdnpinhead - I plan on doing some DIY oil changes inbetween the freebies BMW gives me just in case I decide I want to buy my car out at lease end. I know it's most likely pointless & a waste of money, but I want to do it to get some experience. "
"dino001","October 2012"," My main problem with their cupholder was my favorite thermal mug didn't fit (has too wide bottom  , but yes, large DD cup fits just fine. Panera's mug seems to kick and spill liquid violently when I pull out of their lot, so I learned to hold it in my hand for that. But what's more important, try open both holders and watch your passenger to kick them with their knee, possibly break them with one hit. They're just too close to those knees to comfort, IMHO. Looking how they're build (intricate structure of plastic pieces and springs), I can only imagine how much a replacement would cost, if broken. So, yes I found one thing in F30 I really like more than in my E91 - it is CUPHOLDER. :sick:) "
"graphicguy","October 2012"," dino.....Really sorry to hear about your dealership's service. That really irritates me to no end. I know of one BMW dealership that had somewhat dicey practices. It's probably the more popular of the two BMW dealerships in the area.They would load up a case of techron in my trunk (with an inflated charge tacked onto my oil change bill for the privilege). They said it was ""recommended"" to put in a bottle of techron in the gas tank with every fili up. It is? Recommended by whom?My current BMW dealer (the one who's least preferred in the area) have been at the pinnacle of customer service for me. My BMW service has been free, as they state. Although, I can see my RFTs are going to need replacing by next Spring, maybe sooner. I do think the next set of shoes are going to be conventional (non-RFTs). While I tend to be more cautious with tires, I'm going to swap these out at 20K miles. I could probably get 25K-30K miles out of them, though.I think a lot of it depends on the service manager regarding their practices. What's really a shame, many people think they absolutely need to have their power steering flushed, or that they have to have injectors cleaned every 10K miles.Personally, I've never had a clogged injector, nor have I ever had so much ""gunk"" in my power steering fluid reservoir that I needed it to be flushed. Today's fuels are required by law to contain detergents that keeps injectors clean.habitat....cool write up on the Tesla. I hope they thrive. I think what they're trying to do is viable. And, I think they're one of many ""alternative fuel"" car companies who, while not toppling GM, will carve a nice niche for itself. I can see Tesla being a company who becomes more of a licensing firm (licensing their intellectual property to other car companies) instead of a car manufacturer. "
"dino001","October 2012"," There is always post-service survey. Many of them are useless, with questions formulated in such a way that they make it clear they DON'T want to know what you really think. Will see what BMW sends me. If there is any open question that allows me write an opinion, I'll let them know what I think about those ""recommendations"". They probably won't care, anyway, but I like to give people a chance to make things better, if they are at all interested. "
"markcincinnati","October 2012"," We've had three BMW's and our dealer, The BMW Store, never suggested we spend anything with the dealership for the first 50K miles. We were even given new rotors at over 45K miles -- all with a smile.We would go in on Saturday's for the free hand car wash -- and would ask for the 6 point inspection (also free) which basically got us fluids topped off, air in the tires and a measurement of the remaining brake life and tire life. If we even made a peep about the wipers, well, new wiper blades, no fee, no questions asked. Although I had similar experiences at Audi, when I asked, they didn't seem quite as anxious to volunteer the free services or wiper blades, etc. But if you asked, they gave without any indication that they were anything less than happy to do so.One last thing, our BMW dealer requires every employee in the service department to wear WHITE lab coats -- and you would think you were driving into a surgical theater when you went to the service dept. This level of service and professionalism is impressive. Neither the Cadillac nor the Lexus dealers even come close. Audi also bested the Cadillac and Lexus dealers, but not the BMW store.Of course our BMW store is owned by the former service manager -- which probably means his motto, sales through service is more than a phrase. "
"dino001","October 2012"," They took care of all the damaged parts, including the undercarriage bumper for the lift. I paid nothing at the end. How can I slam them now  ? "
"dino001","October 2012"," At the end - the experience was shockingly disapointing. There was so much anticipation and the mountain gave birth to a mouse, as we say it in my old country. The steering did not get any better over time. I must admit, the car moved in prescribed directions, so it's not like there was no response. But there was no feedback - basically no feeling. Am I at the limit, can I go faster? Nothing.The 2.0l turbo engine is fast and torquey, transmission is brisk and great. If there is any automatic I can have, that's the one. These are admittedly strongest points of the new F30, especially with gas mileage almost 20% higher than my car in same conditions - impressive. But... I take my E91 3.0l NA with manual back and no thanks to a new car any time soon. Hard to explain. I may change my mind over time, but not today.Interior dials are really cheaper in feel and over time felt cheaper and cheaper. To describe the difference is between feeling a soft bump (E91) and hard ratchet (F30). The plastic on those also feels cheaper. I also just noticed that the sunroof liner was not motorized, as opposed to my wagon, but to be fair, I don't remember is E90 sedan had sunroof liner motorized or not. The wagon has a long panoramic sunroof, so the liner has to be moved with its own motor, as it is too far for the driver to reach when he wants to close it from the back. The non-Nav screen has 4:3 aspect ratio, the long panoramic ratio on my E91 Nav is so much better. From pictures it looks their optional nav screen is still panoramic, so you get a different screen than standard version.The screen had a gremlin - today in the morning I got ""No signal"" message and my ipod started playing at fast forward mode (radio played just fine) - really weird. I am absolutely NOT buying a new one and if, God forbid, I needed a new car, the shopping of other brands would definitely be on. Most likely into lower priced territory. There is no point of spending this much money if the product doesn't really deliver. "
"nyccarguy","October 2012"," Correct me if I'm wrong, but the only 2 manufacturers that now offer good old rack & pinion in this ELLPS class steering are Infiniti & Mercedes-Benz.Mercedes-Benz seems to be pretty serious about improving the ""Sport"" in their Sport Sedan. The 2013 C-Class has a new DI 3.5L V6 (248 hp/251 lb-ft torque) in their C300 4Matic. They now have AGILITY CONTROL suspension that: ""automatically adjusts the individual shock absorbers based on the road surface and the driver's current driving style. Valving inside each shock absorber automatically firms up during stronger body motions for sharper handling feedback and stability, and reduces the damping rates during gentler motions for a smoother, more composed ride.""The 4Matic AWD system retains a 45:55 front/rear torque split. It is a RWD based AWD chassis.MB says 0 - 60 mph in 6.0 seconds w/ 7 speed automatic. The C-Class is handsomely styled with nice interior materials. This generation C is definitely not just a ""cheap Mercedes."" "
"graphicguy","October 2012"," Mark...I've never had an issue with either The BMW Store or Jake Sweeney BMW. But, it was The BMW Store who loaded a case of Techron in the trunk, stating it was a good idea to add a bottle every fill-up. An overzealous tech writer? Probably.Jake has always bent over backwards for me....in both sales and service.I consider us lucky to have two good dealers in the city.At one time or another, I've interfaced with probably every luxury dealer in the city, for one reason or another.The only one who was really quite bad was Thompson McConnell Cadillac. And, that was in regards to my late Mother's car (in which they made it a habit of fleecing her, and trying to fleece me). "
"habitat1","October 2012"," I would agree with you that Mercedes is improving the ""sport"" factor, but that's somewhat of a relative improvement. Even with their improvements, and in spite of BMW's steering and Audi's weight, I would still put Mercedes solidly in third place ranking those brands on overall enthusiastic driving dynamics. I am basing this on three categories of comparison, most of which I've driven over the past 12 months:C350 vs. A4/S4 vs. 335iE350/550 vs. A6/S6 vs. 535i/550i SLK vs. TTS vs. Z4 (although none of these are within a mile of a Boxster S)That probably suits Mercedes OK. I don't think they are trying to compete with BMW and Audi for the serious driving enthusiast in these segments, as evidenced by no manual transmissions, a chassis emphasis on comfort rather than handling and slush box automatics vs. DSG's. But, to their credit, they are closing the gap a bit and making the choice of Mercedes for luxury not as much of a tradeoff. Unfortunately BMW appears to be inadvertently helping them to close this gap from the other (wrong) direction. "
"graphicguy","October 2012"," nyc.....the GF was all hot and bothered by the Benz C350 4Matic coupe when she was looking, before deciding on the S4. We test drove a totally loaded one.....black with tan interior (just like my 335i).It felt like a slug. Now, this was a 2012. I think the tech, build quality and materials were anything that wasn't met or exceeded by the BMW or the Audi. Maybe the 2013 is significantly upgraded. But, for $55K (which is the MB's sticker price), I felt it was waaaayyyyy overpriced. "
"dino001","October 2012"," A friend of mine has a three years old C300 with manual transmission (previous generation). It actually feels sportier than I had expected - very much so. I remember I also drove both automatic E90 328 and same C300 generation back-to-back last year. The impressions were ""wow, that Benz is really sporty"". To be fair, I think it was ""sports"" C300 and non-sport package 328, so a bit unfair to the bimmer. But my though was Benz had nothing to be ashamed of - at all. Can't tell about the new C250 - suspect it does not hold the candle to the F30 328 in terms of power, but after this undewhelming steering experience with F30 I don't know anything anymore.  "
"flightnurse","October 2012"," Dino sorry to hear about the dealership, I never had that problem, I would drop the car off and then received keys for the loaner (all in about 20 minutes.) Return loaner, receive my keys and off I went (all in about 20 minutes.) Not once was I ever ""up sold"" on anything, or ""recommended"" anything (since it is covered by the free maintenance if it needed to be done.) I would write the GM of the dealer as well as BMW about this experience, this dealer isn't living up to the true experience.In regards to your driving experience of the F30, like you, I like the drive-train the quick shifts of the 8 spd transmission keep the turbo 4 in the powerband all the time, the car ""feels"" much quicker over the E91. Also drive then E91 and F30 back to back you can ""feel"" the difference in the steering right away, the E90 is weighted and has a direct feel to it, the F30 does not, very ""easy"" and you are right very Buick like. BTW, the sport seats in any 3 series are the better seats for comfort , well next to the comfort seat of the 5, 6, 7 series and x5 and x6 comfort seats. "
"dino001","October 2012"," F10 is a 5-series. E90 and F30 are 3-series. But I get your point - probably there is not much of a difference between current 328 and 528 steering, anyway. "

"dino001","October 2012"," The questions had write-in sections, so I filled it with some spicy comments regarding these service recommendations. Had to really hold myself from saying it too harshly. I was still trying to tell them warranty work was great, but those recommendations were about revenue generation, not real concern. Not sure, if I want anybody call me back or not. Generally don't like these kinds of confrontations. "
"flightnurse","October 2012"," Dino, first off congrats on writing and submitting the survey, management can not make an informed decision without feedback from it's customers. It someone calls you back from the dealership, embrace it, it does not have to be confrontation at all, but a time to educate managements on your experience. My partner had an issue on his first service from the Nissan dealership. He responded to the survey, the GM of the dealership called Rick personally and they both spoke, at the end, the GM was grateful of Ricks honesty, the GM upgraded Rick to the Platinum elite level in their (the dealerships) service reward. This gave Rick two free services a year (basic) and 20% off all other services. Good luck. "
"markcincinnati","October 2012"," Beginning on page 62 of the Dec '12 issue of ROAD & TRACK and continuing through page 65, Honda has spent however much it takes to buy a 4-page, full color advertising spread dedicated to the ""theme"" and title ""The Name of The Game."" There is a boat load of text describing in the best copy writing money can buy, probably, the technologically advanced 2013 Honda Accord. From LED headlights to a feature-laden interior to the description of how the '13 Accord is both smaller on the outside and bigger on the inside.Of course the patient reader is told about the achievement of the ""neat trick"" of being more maneuverable, more powerful and more economical. The damn thing is safer, too -- it says so right in the ad copy.The car is full of such amenities as Pandora radio, Bluetooth this and that, a rearview AND sideview cameras , sat-nav, a voice activated bidet, collision warning, lane departure warning, LaneWatch, a George Foreman fryer with GreaseBlock technology, and even an available 6-speed MANUAL shifter, and to motivate the thing, you can get a 278 horsepower V6 that actually reverses the greenhouse effect of SMOG (on a planetary basis) and (apparently) push-button start and hands-free ingress if you are so inclined.Don't forget adaptive cruise control -- Honda didn't overlook this tech either. I'm sure I've missed stuff, I mean, c'mon the ad is four pages in length and mostly uses a small font as if this is an article about the thing, not an ad.OK, so I read this and I see the picture of the interior which approaches handsome, not Audi handsome but a far cry from any Honda I've ever been turned-off by (including my '12 Acura TL, which, while quite functional is hardly grin inducing when you get behind the wheel.)Now, then, as to the title of my post -- I'm used to the Audi A8 getting the bells and whistles long before the A4 and usually before the A6 and way way way before Audi's ""cousins"" the VW clan. I'm at least aware that Cadillacs [used to] get features, functions and other high-end content (aka, ""stuff you'd like to have in your Chevy or Pontiac or Buick, even) before the lesser aspirational models.

Hell, this Accord seems awfully close to being premium-car state-of-the-art insofar as content and even safety engineering (high strength steel, and ""ACE II"" a body structure engineered to evenly distribute full-frontal crash energy [or nudity] more effectively for instance). Now the engine choices are hardly revolutionary, but they do (claim) to now include direct injection powerplants, CVT transmissions with paddle-shifters (yawn) and ""double-downshifting"" conventional 6-speed autos with rev-matching.My point is, shouldn't all this content, kit, performance and safety rigging be introduced FIRST in the Acura line? Then after two-years, one at-least, and only then be trickled DOWN to the Honda's?What a world, what a world -- The Wicked Witch from the Wizard of OZ. Drive it like you live. DOH!Homer. "

"habitat1","October 2012"," George Foreman fryer with GreaseBlock technologyThe 2013 Accord may have all of those extra goodies, but I'm still betting that after I got behind the wheel, I'd still claim my 2002 Honda S2000 was the best car Honda ever built under the Honda label. Manual seats, no tilt, telescoping steering wheel, a standard two speaker stereo with about 12 watts. But when you pushed the start button and started driving it, none of that other stuff mattered. Don't fall into the trap that thinking do-dads are what makes a car great. 278 horsepower to the front wheels and a weight balance that is still at least 60%+ nose heavy isn't going to get me all worked up over the new Accord, even if that standard George Foreman fryer has a self cleaning function. In fairness, the new Accord may be the best FWD mid size, mid-priced family sedan on the market. And congratulations to Honda for bringing upscale technology and safety to the mass market. But what I think needs to trickle up to Acura is a new attitude. I said it 5 years ago, and it's more true today. Acura could use Honda engineering technology to build a couple of RWD 3 and 5 series competitors with class leading driving dynamics. Sorry, I'm just grumpy because I'm about to dish out $75k for a new Boxster S or pre-owned 911 partly because Acura is too friggin boring to put out a $50k S3000 a decade after Honda showed they could kick [non-permissible content removed] with a $32k S2000. I've been hoping for some trickle up for a long time. Guess it's time to face the fact that it's probably not going to happen for my little niche. "

I considered a pristine pre-owned 1996 NSX at the time I bought my new 2002 S2000 The $32k 240 horsepower S2000 equalled or exceeded the performance of the 270 hp NSX. Comparable acceleration, handling edge to the lighter, tighter S2000. The NSX had more prestige, but not more sports car guts or build quality. Not to mention that the NSX with 30k miles was $49k used and had been $85k+ new. Granted, the second generation NSX upped the performance slightly with the 290hp 3.2 liter engine, but the price of the NSX was never a remotely good sports car bang for the buck. On the other hand, the S2000 kicked the butt of everything within 50% of its price: base Boxster, Z3/4, SLK, 370Z. etc. Perhaps not in high torque, raw muscle car acceleration, or luxury do-dads, but in extraordinary engineering and visceral sports car performance and handling. I'll repeat that I think it was the best car to ever wear a Honda/Acura label.What happened to the Tesla? Also how does someone cross shop a Boxster S, 911 and Tesla?I like the ""because I can"" response, but then again, why not?? Same general price and with the Model S Performance Edition, it scoots 0 to 60 in 3.9 seconds. Plus, I like the green concept, even if I don't think human farting was responsible for Manhatten being under a mile of ice 16,000 years ago. But alas, after a test drive two weeks ago, I've just about crossed the Tesla off my list. The interior layout and material quality was too much like a high tech golf cart then a high tech luxury performance sedan. I'm going to get back over for another drive with my wife before I decide whether or not to ask for our deposit back, but as of right now, I told the electrician to hold off extending the 220 volt service in my garage (the damn plug is in the rear of the car).

"habitat1","November 2012"," I'm probably not Honda's target market for a FWD Accord now, but it wasn't that long ago that I might have been. After all, I still drive a 2004 FWD TL 6-speed as my everyday car. My ""trickle up"" comments were more to question why Acura hasn't set itself more apart from Honda. Lexus has V8's and RWD, Infiniti is pretty far removed from the Nissan line-up. But Acura, much as I like the parent company, hasn't really done much that isn't more than a moderate uptick from Honda - other than putting SH-AWD in this and that. As for the new NSX, as my baseball manager/coach tells me, I'm not getting any younger. I'm having a tough time waiting for the new Cayman to be unveiled at the LA auto show in 4 weeks. By the time Seinfeld and all of the other celebrities get the first batch of NSX's, I may be ready for one of those motorized chairs they advertise on late night TV. Besides, haven't seen the details, but I have this stinking feeling that Acura is only going to offer some kind of computer aided automatic transmission on the NSX. That - and about $300,000 - are what keeps me from considering the new Ferraris. As long as I'm not in a wheelchair, I want to use my left foot to depress a real clutch pedal. Kind of hard to do that on a Tesla, given that it's only one gear. But everything else, I'll shift my own thank you. "
"flightnurse","November 2012"," The S2000 and NSX are not in the same league. While the S2000 handles well for the price of admission, not once in all of the years did I read any auto enthusiast magazine compare the S2000 and NSX together. As you pointed out the S2000 was fighting with the likes of Z3/Z4, Boxster, Z350/370 crowd. While the NSX was battling with Ferrari, Lambo's and such. Since the NSX was Honda's flagship sports car, I'm not too sure that the S2000 could be Honda's best built car. Now for you maybe, but that statement would be hard pressed to hold itself in a larger automotive community. "

But alas, after a test drive two weeks ago, I've just about crossed the Tesla off my list. The problem is that the car is a half-baked attempt at an electric vehicle. They took a ready-made car, the Lotus Elise (which is a horrendously expensive platform to use) and then added a thousand pounds of weight to it in batteries. The Leaf, on the other hand, is a purpose-built EV and while it needs refinement and work, is actually pretty good for a first serious attempt at a EV by a major auto maker. Yes, I know other cars existed in the past, but this one you can actually *buy* and not lease, and it's not designed with government regulations and making some lawyers happy. It's designed to actually be a proper vehicle in the marketplace. They did make the S2000 until 2009, so you might actually get a very lightly used S2000. As for new, the Scion FR-S coupe is actually quite compelling. It's inexpensive, has a good engine and drivetrain layout, and just begs for a supercharger to be added. (my local dealer had brochures for local TRD suppliers/shops in the showroom and was saying that it would be 6 months, tops, before they were able to do it in-house).Independent shops are reporting yields in the 280-320HP range, which would turn it into a European car crusher, much like the NSX was.Yes, it's not Honda. But it's not a bad second choice if you need fas, fun, and new. (though I'd still take a S2000 in a heartbeat) "
"stickguy","November 2012"," It sounds like the factory will probably take care of the turbo for you within a year or so.one of this months car magazines had a piece on the turbo version of that engine, and certainly speculated that this car would get it (along with the WRX, etc.).I think it already has a nice balance of power, cost, complexity (or lack of!) as it is, and is more than fast enough. But, I am sure that they will make a boatload of money selling a turbo model for what, another 3K or so? "
"habitat1","November 2012"," not once in all of the years did I read any auto enthusiast magazine compare the S2000 and NSX togetherBut I did that comparison. With my own butt in the drivers seat and had my own checkbook out.. 1996 NSX 30k miles vs. new 2002 S2000. They were a hell of a lot closer than you might be fooled into thinking from simply reading Road and Track and not doing the comparison yourself.Both the NSX and S2000 were hand built, side by side at the same Japanese factory. Both had fit and finish were FAR superior to anything made by Honda or Acura in the US. Both were engineered by the same team of Honda's Formula One racing team engineers. The NSX produced 90 hp/liter without turbos. Great for it's time in 1990. They improved it to 91 hp / liter a little later. The S2000 produced 120 hp / liter in 2000. You need a $140k 911 GT3 RS to approach that output today, 12 years later. The BMW M3, 104 hp /liter. Halfway between the NSX and S2000.The bottom line is that the 1996 NSX I almost bought had a price tag of $85,000 new, $15,000 more than the 1996 911 C2. But by 2002, even a new NSX was no where near the same performance league as a Ferrari 360 or (cheaper) 911S. Yet, at under $35k, for the entire 10 year run of the S2000, nothing within $10-20k of its price could match its engineering, build quality or overall performance. I'm not saying that the NSX wasn't a very good car during its early years. But way before the end of its run, it had become a underpowered, overpriced, stale car. And sold a few dozen the last couple of years before Acura finally and mercifully pulled the plug. The S2000 never suffered that level of competitive deterioration or indignation. It came in a winner, went out a winner vis a vis its competition. Some people - perhaps you - don' want to give the S2000 credit because it didn't cost $50k+ or carry the same exclusiveness/prestige. I look at it differently. Acura had a marginally competitive car in the $85k price range. It's biggest advantage when it was introduced was that it didn't break. Porsche fixed their reliability issues. Acura sat on its hands relative to keeping the NSX performance competitive. Honda had a sub $35k car that was the class leader, by a big margin, for a decade straight. That gets my vote. You can place yours on the NSX. "

My BIL got one when they first came out (He had the first one in central NY, and I imagine one of the earliest ones int eh country) and he still has it.

"habitat1","November 2012"," Stickguy - S2000 came out in late 1999 as a MY 2000. The years to own were 2002 and 2003, IMO. For 2002 they added glass (vs. plastic) rear window, stronger clutch / transmission, and a few other upgrades. But in 2004 they replaced the 9,000 RPM 2.0 liter engine with a 8,000 rpm redline 2.2 liter engine. Same horsepower, slightly more low end torque, but it lost a little of the high rpm edge that made it a fan favorite. Schumacher once commented that it's the closest thing under $100,000 to a Ferrari in spirit.Ivan - The RX8 never did anything for me. A couple of rungs down the ladder in performance, funky 4 door with mini back seat. It certainly didn't have any success on the track like the S2000 enjoyed. About the only thing it had going for it was the novelty of a high RPM rotary engine. But given the lower performance and horrific gas mileage, it didn't get beyond the novelty stage. "
"sweendogy","November 2012"," 2004 tL 6 speed - so in car years you do drive a 2007 accord 6pd - now I understand- so maybe you are an accord target. .

"habitat1","November 2012"," 2004 tL 6 speed - so in car years you do drive a 2007 accord 6pd.Not quite. The 2004 TL 6-speed also came with Brembo brakes, a noticeably firmer sport suspension and summer performance tires compared to the automatic (since switched to high performance all season). So even though the Accord and some other FWD cars now have comparable horsepower, I would still put my 2004 TL as one of the best handling and braking FWD mid size sedans I've driven. Unfortunately, with the latest generation, the FWD TL has morphed into more of an Accord Plus, and the AWD one is nearly a quarter ton heavier and does not have a separate sport suspension set up even on the 6-speed manual version.I do agree a bit with your underlying point, though. Acura has not really acted like they want to be a distinct luxury/sport division from the mothership Honda. Certainly not the way Lexus has gone well above Toyota in product design and pricing with the LS and GS models. Hell, even Hyundai has a V8 RWD sedan that is priced higher then the droopy flagship RL, and they DIDN'T need a luxury division label to give them the balls to try. Infiniti has its own set of problems, but at least when they started with the Q45, they had the ambition of going above Nissan in a relatively big way. The good news for Acura is that I think Honda is a stronger starting point then Toyota and way above Nissan. But I'd like to see them show more commitment to designing and building cars that seriously compete with Audi's A6 and above and BMW's 5 series and above in the sport luxury segment. The ILX? Really? We've already had the Integra, RSX, TSX and the XXX. Do we really need another model that begs the question ""where does this fit in between the Accord, Civic and TL?"" They appear to be stuck in perennial underachievement. Note to Acura: Please, Acura, give me something with RWD and a 50/50 weight balance to seriously consider over a 535i or 550i 6-speed and S6. Go ahead and borrow some Hyundai balls to price it at $50-60k+ If you do it right, I'll buy one, I promise. "

So occasionally you got a real gem in the middle of the crap. Because people were trying everything and anything to be different and maybe make a breakthrough.Today, cars are all jellybeans and are all designed by people that all went to the same half dozen design schools.

"plekto","November 2012"," All engines tend to not do well at 10K+ feet. Some engines run at excess capacity and can compensate and some cannot. ie - a GM supercharger simply assumes you have normal density air/runs at full pressure and so it's effect at higher altitude is to essentially offer little if any boost to the engine. Though it will likely make the engine get enough extra air that it will operate fairly normally.Most turbos work similarly. The downside of turbos, though, is that most of them are attached to tiny engines that have no torque unless the tubro is engaged, so you have to downshift a gear or two to keep the RMPs up enough to get that boost. This of course is easier with a manual for either type of design, which is why manual transmissions are usually best for high altitude running as well.

"habitat1","November 2012"," Porsche went back to making the sunroof an option for the new 911. They offset it by making the navigation system standard, so it didn't look like they were being too cheap. They did it in response to requests from serious track type buyers. It adds a not insignificant amount of weight (75+/- lbs) to the very top of the car, slightly raising the center of gravity as well.BMW makes the sunroof a no cost option on the M3 for the same reason. Some prefer the carbon fiber roof, stiffer structure and lower weight. I must confess that I considered the large panorama sunroof to be a positive feature in our X5d, compared to the dinky one in the MDX. But it wasn't a major decision factor and would be even less so in a ELLPS. "
"markcincinnati","November 2012"," I think Infiniti and Acura need to be perceived as ""a"" (if not ""the"") brand to talk about (there are other makes as well that need some help in the promotion dept.)I subscribe to ""too many"" auto magazines (my wife says it's too many): Automobile, Car & Driver, Motor Trend, Road & Track and Esquire (?).Month-in, month-out these magazines have stories, ads, ""tests"" & news items about Audi and BMW (to name two.) Now I know other cars buy ad space and are written about, too; but, somehow Audi and BMW always seem to be doing something that gets them written about. It is the combination of ""reminder"" advertising coupled with opinion pieces, features, featurettes and actual tests (and cover stories) including long-term tests and comparisons that keeps Audi and BMW in the mind's eye even if it is not ""officially"" tested in this month's issue.Audi, BMW and others (Porsche comes to mind) are often featured in words and pictures that are ""lifestyle"" pieces, just to make sure you're never more than a page turn away from something that shines a light on the brand.Of course if you are an Audi or BMW owner, you are aware of the corporate sponsored ""for owners only"" magazines: the slick, glossy ""lifestyle"" magazines that often out-do Travel & Liesure, Field & Stream and Architectural Digest, among others, for content and style. Whenever I get my Audi magazine it never ceases to amaze me the apparent expense Audi must take on to produce such a piece. Often the articles aren't even about the cars, but about some halo lifestyle. The magazines are meant to let you know that having a BMW or and Audi makes you a member of a very exclusive and desirable club.The Acura magazine is OK, but it still looks like it is a thinly disguised advert for Acura -- I can't remember any such ""corporate organ"" from Infiniti.Yes, the cars should be the stars, but marketing to make you want to be a ""member"" of the [fill-in-th-blank] club or to make you want to remain a member of the club is certainly important, too.I haven't had an Audi for 14 months, yet when I got my latest Audi magazine it was worth looking at and reading from cover-to-cover. I still felt like a member in good standing when I got it. The feeling wasn't even close when I got my first Acura magazine (14 months after the purchase of a '12 TL.)My wife got a Bimmer magazine and she, too, took time out to page through the entire thing -- hello Infiniti, is this thing on?We have Audi and BMW shirts, sweaters, wind-breaker, car-key fobs, wrist watches and stick pins collected at the auto maker's boutiques in North America and all over Europe. I even have ""Audi Experience"" note pads that were a gift from Audi as well as a set of 6 wine glasses with the four interlocking rings etched into them (and a complete set of brass Audi coasters to set the wine glasses on to not stain the coffee tables.) Even American Express' platinum card magazine is something most auto brands should hone in on as examples of keeping the proselytizing on-going.Getting a customer to buy-into the brand (you may call it hype or any thing else that means promotion) is important to keeping them in the fold. Despite my ""logical"" and ""rational"" reasons for not re-upping for Audi #30 last year, I still feel a kinship to the brand.The auto makers on this list could take a page out of Audi, BMW, Porsche's and (probably) Mercedes play books. That (the above) is ""What Is Going on with Infiniti (?)"".Drive it like you live or drive it like ""they"" make you think you are living. :surprise: "

But the question I was responding to seemed to me to beg a marketing response. Good or even great products can get lost without sufficient and great marketing. Now, I am NOT suggesting that Acura and Infinitis at this juncture have GREAT cars -- they do, however, have good to very good products.The original poster seemed to ask why we don't hear much from Infiniti (as I recall it was Infiniti.)A great magazine, for instance, doesn't make a great car -- I only suggest that marketing practices that will support a great product are, today, needed. "
"habitat1","November 2012"," ..setting aside glossy magazines, logo coffee mugs and golf hats, I'd put these two items at the absolute pinnacle of marketing:(1) BMW Performance Center Delivery: Order your BMW from scratch and whether its an X5 made down the road in SC or M3 made in Germany, you have the option of picking it up at the Performance Delivery Center in Spartanburg. At NO additional charge. That includes a free night and dinner at the Marriott, 3 hours of track and off road time with BMW's professional racing/driving instructors, a tour of the 4.5 million s.f. factory and as much time as you want browsing the BMW museum and reminiscing about what you were doing when the pristine 2002 tii on display was their hot little car. I don't know what this costs BMW to put on - I went through at least $500 in tire rubber and brake pads trying to keep an X5d ahead of some young guy and his wife chasing me in an M3. (2) Porsche Driving Events: The BMW sister Porsche dealership, not to be outdone, invited me and my wife to a Sunday driving event 5 weeks ago. The instructor to student ratio was about 1 to 3 and for a total of 12 of us, they had no fewer than 4 Panameras, 4 Carrera S's and 2 Boxster S's for us to throw around the track. I KNOW I went through at least $1,000 of rubber at this one. I think Audi does similar events.Frankly, Acura and Infiniti (not to mention Lexus and a few others) probably shouldn't even try to replicate this type of marketing. You really need the goods to show off, if you do. Compared to the X5, our MDX would either burn right through the flimsy brakes or flip on its roof on the track, or break in half trying to go through 24"" of water and up and down boulders in the off road course. Whether or not I ever buy another Porsche, I'll be doing some word of mouth marketing on behalf of the company for a few years as a result of that one Sunday morning. "
"billyperksii","November 2012"," Proof is in the pudding.That's why I will probably try the Germans on my next go around but for now I will enjoy my TL- only 20K going on 4 four years.

"flightnurse","November 2012"," Excellent post, however, you have missed one other aspect of BMW ownership that is the BMW Club of America. They hold event year round whether it is on the track or a park. It is nice to see a company that really treats the people who buy their products as a family. The BMW motorcycle side of the company does the same thing, but they take things one step further, they have rally's (weekend events) and October is the big month. MB was big into event for their customers but have basically stop this, I'm not too sure if Audi does. "
"sweendogy","November 2012"," I will say that the BMW club idea is great to some - infact it maybe a driver of sales, but who really knows the value of this- I guess it does get owners closer in some way. The majority of BMW, Audi, Infiniti, mb, Acura owners do not participate in such clubs- most are buying (leasing) a car that fits needs/budgets. The majority of the people who would participate are the select few enthusiasts that not only enjoy the brand but enjoys driving. Which is a good thing- I would guess at one event you would see a lot of M series owners and 2002s and 318s -which is pretty cool - how many 399 a month leased 328 autos will be in the crowd is anyone's guess, my guess is not many. Rock the vote people. "

That's been the basis for endorsement advertising and brand imaging for a long time, and at least with respect to something like the BMW CCA, they are getting real people / customers involved in enhancing the brand image. Buick hires Shaq to try to enhance its image, BMW lets you loose on a real track. And you tell a few friends and they tell a few friends and.... "

"buya","November 2012"," Why would non-enthusiast pick a BMW lease over a Camry purchase?Don't take things too seriously. Crossed and rebuke is ok. Read again other posts some contributors wrote and you'll see getting all worked up is waste of your precious health.There're all sorts of reasons why people lease BMW over Camry. Top reasons would be status symbol and the fact that it's a damned good car! Leasing takes away the troubles of trying to register your credit card with the dealership for all the little annoying things that will come after the warranty expires, so you don't have to remember to bring the card. Of course there're those who flagged themselves as enthusiasts and know cars in and out, even rebuilding one from scratch. That in itself is bragging. It is as snotty as buying performance cars for their price and prestige. Didn't check who posted the original question and didn't care either. The comparison is flawed because Camry is a sedan not in the same class as BMW, which is known for performance. The question looked sarcastic, and it looked like ""poor people who can only afford to buy Camry should not have a big head of trying to lease into rich people's world and drive a BMW"". I recent these forms for communications and views because these are the foundation that build to the poor children from heritage had to act apologetic and feel guilty -- for absolutely NO reasons. Money itself is not a crime, people make things what they are.For someone who know nothing about the mechanics of cars, I like performance cars. I like BMW but I won't buy another one simply because it's a BMW - the badge. The question would be more of a question of curiosity if it were ""why would a life long high-end performance cars owner choose to buy a Camry?"" I can tell you it's not for performance. Camry is a reliable car for daily commute if you take care of it's basic needs, but it's definitely not a car you would choose to do long distance. I drove a loaner out of town once and I can attest to that!MB is increasingly unreliable, and if I buy another one of them it's only for the name and not even for nostalgic. Yep, status. But which I don't care!Obvious answer why BMW over Camry is performance. To a lot of people it's the badge. "
"andys120","November 2012"," Why would non-enthusiast pick a BMW lease over a Camry purchase?I am an enthusiast and when my non-enthusiast friends (who tend to drive pickups and Subarus) ride me about getting a ""Beemer"" I tell them it cost about the same as a new loaded Camry ($26K). If there hadn't been a good supply of nice second-hand BMWs available at a BMW specialist near me I'd probably be driving something else. Buying used is a good solution for those who would rather own than lease, they are very well made and the depreciation curve is pretty steep. My 4 y/o 528iA (44K) cost about 50% of the new price and it's such a good car that I recently bought another Reitzle-era BMW, an 11 y/o 330Ci cabriolet (78K)which cost me about the same as a new Ford Focus ($13K).I'll admit that part of it's badge snobbery but there's also build-quality and wonderful RWD driving pleasure. :shades: "
"graphicguy","November 2012"," Interesting discussion. I don't know why others buy what they buy.

Maybe!What it does do is give me an appreciation of a finely engineered car capable of doing things other cars aren't capable of doing. To some, a Camry is the kind of drive that appeals to people (lots of them, given how many they sell). To others, a BMW or Audi or Porsche evokes the driving experience they desire.Frankly, I don't know why people buy what they buy. I know I do like the driving experience that BMW and Audi offers....over just about anything else.That said, I also have a ratty 200K mile Accord sitting in my driveway. I appreciate it for what it is, too.....just for different reasons.Some view cars as necessary evils. For the vast majority of us, a car certainly isn't a good financial investment.

Hard to call that cheap, but with 335is's and even plain 335i's stickering for over $60,000, it looks like a relative bargain.I test drove a 2013 M3 this past Saturday. Six speed manual of course. I'm sure the upcoming redesigned 2014 model with a 450 hp turbocharged 6 cylinder engine will be a great car. But there is something to be said for a 414 hp, 8,300 rpm redline, naturally aspirated V8. I expect the 2014 will be viewed as BMW's version of Porsche going away from the air-cooled 911 in 1999. Or Johnny Damon going from the Red Sox to the Yankees. Lost the hair, lost the soul. "

Otherwise, I might end up with a 2013 M3 at near giveaway prices. I will say that when I had my 911, my Acura TL was more enjoyable to drive then. I didn't feel like it needed to go beyond it's capabilities to be satisfying. It's a damn nice, economical to own, sporty sedan; if not an all out ""performance sedan"". And I could let the guy next to me in his 550i rev his engine without feeling inferior - knowing that I had a car in the garage that could run circles around it. Now the only other gas powered things in my garage are a lawnmower, leaf blower and chainsaw. Although I have to admit, the chainsaw fills a bit of my need to be manly, at a considerably lower cost than the 911 did.So if you need to save up for a Boxster, maybe get a chainsaw in the interim?

Will likely pay full MSRP and maybe get a free Porsche logo hat thrown in. Ah well, I like a deal but I'd rather have this car. And If I cut my brains out in a chainsaw accident and wake up wanting to turn the Cayman into a Nissan GT-R, that can be done.

"habitat1","December 2012"," As they say in big business - paying retail is for [email?protected]@kersWell if you were lucky enough to be one of the few hundred buyers to pick up a brand new Ferrari 430 or 458 at the MSRP, you could have driven it for a year, sold it and bought a GT-R with the profit. Of course, that would get you quickly knocked off Ferrari's ""A"" list for future purchases. Me, that's not a list I'll soon - or ever - be on.I hope this makes you almost as happy as me - I just put a deposit on a 2013/4 Cayman S at a discount off MSRP, and am #1 on their list for a customer ordered car. Porsche won't take the order for another few weeks and I won't get the car before April, but I think my shopping is over. Regarding the GTR, if you must have 0-60 in under 3 seconds for $100k, my choice would be to buy a 2-3 year old pre-owned 911 Turbo S. The only thing that will get you to 60 quicker is a Bugatti. The Porsche is a little more refined for my tastes. And doesn't look like it was created by an uncooperative committee of Nissan designers that used the Plymouth Barracuda for inspiration. Plus, Porsche still believes in offering manual transmissions - an unfortunate rarity in the world of supercars. http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/coupes/1206_nissan_gt_r_black_edition_vs_por- - - - sche_911_turbo_s_comparison/viewall.html "

The Turbo's depreciate at a faster rate than the GT-3 - as further evidence of what the serious enthusiasts really enjoy driving. The independent Porsche service place I go to has a legendary master mechanic and former race team member who has even disconnected the front wheel drive on a number of 993 and 996 Turbo's because of the enthusiast preference for RWD. "
"habitat1","December 2012"," And what track did you drive this GT-R? No track, I-270 and the DC Beltway during some non-rush hour times. And it was last year with a 2011 model.Again, great numbers on paper and there is no disputing the 500+ hp and AWD ability to get the 2-ton car around a track quickly. But until you drive one, it's hard for me to explain the unsatisfactory experience I had. This is just a sledgehammer of a car, nothing scalpel like about it, when you are driving it anywhere but the Nurburgring track. Nissan's answer to the Viper, not a Ferrari or Porsche. And, by the way, the RWD 911GT2 took back the title from the GT-R with a lap time of 7:18. Again, not that this matters that much to me. I want a sports car that is attractive, light, enjoyable to drive at 30 mph as much as 100+ and still let's me row my own gears, no matter how bad or slow I am.

The builds speed VERY quickly and can stop just as quick. We all have our likes and dislikes, you like the S2000 over a NSX, you like the Cayman and I like the Boxster.Now if Nissan can shave off 750 pounds from the GT-R I highly doubt you will fine a better car for the money... "
"habitat1","December 2012"," Now if Nissan can shave off 750 pounds from the GT-R I highly doubt you will fine a better car for the money...That 750 lb ""shave"" may involve a few hours with my chain saw and end up with something that looks more like a Cayman than a GT-R. No I suspect Nissan will continue to produce a nearly two ton GT-R and be unapologetic for its girth. As they have every right to be. My preference for a lighter weight, more refined, manual transmission coupe like the new Cayman S over the GT-R is just that, a preference. Most of my time in the driver's seat will be in sub-sonic speeds where nimble handling - and interior design - will be noticed, but the raw power of 545hp will not. Would I like more power? Who among us wouldn't? But if it's a trade off between 0-60 in 4.5 seconds and 2.9 seconds vs. giving up the enjoyment of shifting my own gears, a marginally ugly interior (IMO) and Barracuda inspired exterior, and a car that is ""clunky"" around town (Edmund's quote), I'll take 4.5. But that does not mean that I don't respect your choice to go with the GT-R based upon your preferences.It may be valid to call something ""better"" based upon a single attribute. But my choice of cars - and I suspect yours - involves several attributes, some of which are in conflict with each other and change over time. In 2005 I bought a 911S Cab at $10k more than the coupe. The soft top was a detriment to absolute track performance, but a joy for my daughters in the mini-back seats. Now I'm about to pay $3,000 more for a Cayman coupe than a Boxster. Go figure.Bringing this back to ELLPS, the trade-off preferences can be even more subtle. Nissan is often dinged on the lack of refinement relative to the G37 vs. the BMW 335i or even Acura TL-AWD. Other's might take the raw power and performance of a Subaru WRX and ask why anyone would consider a more expensive ELLPS. As you said, it all comes down to likes and dislikes and weighing preferences, not just a single attribute. "
"plekto","December 2012"," It sounds to me like you might be interested in the new Scion/Subaru coupes. They are light, agile, and perfect for zooming around town and up and down mountain roads. Plus, you could get one, modify it with a supercharger, and a ton of other goodies and still be 10K under the price of the Nissan or Porsche.As much as I love the Cayman, it's overpriced and they still haven't really fixed the problem with the output shaft bearings. The Nissan is simply too heavy to be considered. "
"andys120","December 2012"," they still haven't really fixed the problem with the output shaft bearingsMy understanding is that the infamous Intermediate Shaft bearing failures were cured when they eliminated the entire part with the adoption of the 997 motor circa 2007.

"habitat1","December 2012"," It sounds to me like you might be interested in the new Scion/Subaru coupes.Once again, personal preferences. I still like playing baseball with 20- and 30- somethings, but I'm a couple decades and entire headset past wanting to have something that would characterize me as a boy racer. I'll pay up and forego that $10k difference. No argument that Porsche pricing isn't a little painful...they didn't become the most profitable car company on the planet by accident. But, to their credit, the craftsmanship and engineering is right up there with the best on the planet. I sometimes wish Honda had evolved their S2000 into an S3500, but for now, there really isn't anything in a sports car format that appeals to me as much as the Cayman and/or 911. So I guess I'll pay up for that preference as well.The good news is that they did fix the rear main seal leak, if that is what you are referring to. Some time ago, in fact. I had a 2005 911S (997) and it didn't drip a drop of oil in 5.5 years and 30k+ miles. That problem pretty much went out the door with the 996 model of 911 and the pre-2008 (I think) Boxsters and Caymans. My independent Porsche mechanic has a 2007 Cayman with 120k+ miles that looks brand new, and he would claim it was all about proper break in. "

All Porsche designs that use the intermediate shaft design are going to fail. Not if, but when. Sure, they did other tricks to keep the things lasting a bit longer, but the overall design itself was rubbish.Just something to keep in mind when you think about buying a ""2 to 3 year old Cayman"". Be *sure* it's a 2009 or newer model, since the engines are horrendously expensive to fix. "
"habitat1","December 2012"," Not sure where you got your Porsche expertise, but you aren't related to my brother in law, are you? As a union electrical contractor, he is essentially forced to buy GM or Ford or suffer career consequences. So he comes up with comments like ""I'd be holding my breath"" on expensive repairs, mechanical failures, etc. when I bought a 911S back in 2005. As it turned out, he went through two Cadillac Escalades in the 5 1/2 years I had the 911, took massive depreciation hits on both, had POS quality issues with each, and had to actually sue his GM dealer over warrant repairs that were faulty. I had 3-4 oil changes and 1-2 minor warranty repairs that were all handled professionally. Yes, Porsche hourly service rates are definitely higher than Joe Goodwrench. But fortunately, I didn't need to use them, other than for a few oil changes. And my experience, as well as that of my colleagues, has been consistent with the fact that Porsche and Lexus have been interchanging top spots for quality and reliability the past several years. If you have had first hand Porsche experience to the contrary, sorry to hear that. Porsche is good, but by no means perfect, and the pre-2005 996 RMS issues were not handled as well as they should have been. But, if you are related to my brother in law and perhaps have an axe to grind against someone who prefers Porsche to Scion, that's not my issue to address. "
"habitat1","December 2012"," what would be 41.8K in today's dollars (ouch)...or 10K less than a BASE Cayman.I seem to recall a new Honda S2000 was still under $36,000 when they ended production for 2010. In November 2001 (2002 MY), the S2000 was at least $15-25k+ less than all of its competition of the day - SLK, Boxster S (base Boxster was only 201hp), Z3 3.0i. In addition, the S2000 had an options list that had exactly 1 item on it: pick your color. Everything else was standard - leather interior, power roof, etc.. It was a pretty spartan car compared to a Lexus, but it delivered on true sports car performance and engineering that only the Boxster S could match at a price of $55k, reasonably equipped. Which has now grown close to $75k, similarly equipped in 2013. Even the Base Boxster today - albeit a enormously improved car compared to the 2002 base Boxster - is $60k+ with ""normal"" options. A base Cayman for $52k?? Are you sure you don't want a steering wheel with that, sir? P.S. Edmund's Host, if you are watching: I recall that when I bought my 2002 S2000 in November 2001, the MSRP was $32,880 and Edmunds TMV for the DC region was $36,000, $3,200 OVER MSRP. In California, it was higher still. Perhpas you can check Edmunds archives to verify? This was 2 full years after the car was first introduced. The high demand, limited supply was still resulting in dealer premiums. I only got a discount because of an early snowfall, 10 weeks after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. By the following spring, I had offers to sell the car for more than I paid for it - back to the dealer. "

"habitat1","December 2012"," Thanks, although that doesn't show what Edmunds TMV was back in 2001. Which...is just fine. I need to reprioritize my time and focus on the future if I'm going to be able to write the check for a Cayman S come April. "

"plekto","December 2012"," Do a search via Google or Bing for ""Porsche ims failures"". Numerous sites explain that the issue affects all M96/M97 engines. The issue is that the design doesn't lubricate the bearings adequately. The problem is exacerbated by automatics and typical American driving patterns since the engine is designed to run properly (and lubricate itself properly) with frequent 5K RPM shifts. If you run it like you stole it and have a manual, it'll last about twice as long. If you put racing oil in it, you'll likely be fine as that's close to Euro standards. American oil is also far to low ppm zinc to give any level of fallback if the engine starts to wear out.According to independent analysis, they are rated for 90% reliability at 90K miles. At a constant speed of 60mph. Yes, that means you can expect 10% of the bearings to fail by 90K miles. And if you run it faster than that, it'll wear out faster. If you run low ppm oil in it or don't change it regularly, it'll wear out faster. If you lug the engine or have an automatic, it'll also wear out faster.The bearings are garbage and essentially need to be replaced like a timing belt at 60-70K miles to be safe. At $2500 cost. (10 hours labor plus $900 in parts last I checked, plus tax.) Quite a steep ""service item"". To top it all off, they look at you like you are daft if you question this logic. I mean, the first 15K mile service cost a mere $500 (a couple of rounds of golf), so why are you complaining about a $2500 bearing change every 4 or 5 years?You have to love Porsche dealers... "
"fedlawman","December 2012"," Or you install the LN Engineering upgrade once and you're good. "
"plekto","December 2012"," Yeah, that's the $2500 ""fix"". The one nice thing is that you can get a lot of used Boxsters and Caymans with blown engines for literally nothing. Rebuild the engine and upgrade the IMS bearings and you're golden.But buying new or CPO, yeah, get a 2009 or newer. All of that said, though, I dearly miss the S2000. They really need to make a replacement version of it. Maybe a little more bling and a hard top as well. I'd still rather have a S2000 versus a Cayman. "
"Kirstie_H","December 2012"," If you really, really wanted to know, you could use the ""help"" link at the top of this page, then choose the ""contact us"" option. There's a person, or several people, who provide historical values, but really only by request that way. "
"flightnurse","December 2012"," I have to to give it to Acura when the NSX had the snap ring issue, they stepped up and would replace the transmission with no questioned asked. Of course this only effected some of the 91 ans 92 NSX's. So how Porsche done the same thing with the problem? This to me shows if the manufacture really cares about its reputation or not. "
"fedlawman","December 2012"," Porsche sort of acknowledged the problem by beefing up the IMS bearing in later (M97) models. I don't believe there are many (or any?) instances of failure with the M97.Just one of several good reasons to just say no to water cooled Porsches IMHO...  "
"flightnurse","December 2012"," I have to say this has been an interesting threat about the IMS failure, I have extended my search for my fun car between the NSX and a Boxster S, now I am aware of the IMS failure, I know what I'm getting myself into. From the readings here it seems that the IMS should be replaced as a failure will happen at some point and the cost of the replacement is much less then the cost of a new engine. So if porsche is aware of the problem why haven't they helped owners out like Acura had done with the Snap Ring on the NSX? "
"fedlawman","December 2012"," Dont know. Could be the general European attitude about planned obsolescence. Who knows?The nice thing about the IMS issue is you can get an older Boxster for pennies, do the upgrade and end up with a really fine sports car for cheap.Ive been toying with the idea of doing this just to keep the miles off my 911. "
"flightnurse","December 2012"," I would think that Porsche could pay for the replacement of the IMS to the upgraded one for no cost, this would go a long way in customer relations and if an engine needed to be replaced because of the IMS, Porsche could pay for half or 3/4 of price tag. I'm not too sure how I would feel if I paid 85K for my new (2007) Porsche and 5 years later at 75K miles (or so) needed to spend 20K on a new engine because of a part that Porsche knew would fail... I'm surprised no law suits have been files over this. "
"flightnurse","December 2012"," Could be the general European attitude about planned obsolescenceI'm not too sure if this is really case or that the attitude has changed to have this happen. MB build theirs to last look at the W126 series S class. They are tanks, well build and have lasted. But of course this meant people weren't trading in their S class's as often and MB wasn't selling the cars they wanted.In regards to the Boxster, this is why I have been looking at them. One can get a 2005-07 at a good price. Spent 2500 for the replacement of the IMS and have a car that will last a while... "
"fedlawman","December 2012"," All you have to do is look at a new BMW, Audi, Range Rover, etc. to see that the Euro manufacturers obviously dont want the owner servicing the vehicle. We are supposed to buy new from the dealer, drive for 3 or 4 years, then trade in on another new one. "
"fedlawman","December 2012"," I drove a W140 S Class for 3 years. it was the last of the great Mercedes tanks IMO. What a fantastic boat! "
"flightnurse","December 2012"," LOL, I didn't like the style of the W140's as much as I did the W126s. "
"flightnurse","December 2012"," That really can be said about any manufacture these days. Our Genesis or our neighbor's new Altama. Yes, you can check all fluid levels and add if needed, but that is really about it. "
"graphicguy","December 2012"," We are supposed to buy new from the dealer, drive for 3 or 4 years, then trade in on another new one.I concur. I'd even throw the Japanese Lux brands into that mix. They certainly don't want the shadetree mechanic messing with the car.I know I used to do my own tuneups (now, you just change the plugs), oil changes (if you can find the oil filler tube, today), and brake jobs on all of my cars. It's too much of a hassle, now. Many times, it takes specialized tools.They like turning their inventory over new, and 4 years as used, ""Dealer Maintained"" cars, while you sign the dotted line for a new one.Personally, I'm not that brand loyal. I think the only model I've owned more than once would be an Acura TL and BMW 3 series.All the people I've known that have owned Porsches (3 of them) swear by their reliability and robust build. Can't disagree with them as they seem to stick with Porsches once it's time for a new one. "
"nyccarguy","December 2012"," Like fedlawman said, it is a shame that $30, $40, $50K cars are considered disposable in our society. Many people only see the out of warranty repair cost or maintenance cost & not the cost of depreciation.Today's cars are extremely complex. I have a thought in the back of my mind that I might buy the lease out on my 2011 328xi. If I do so, I'd like to be prepared. So I went & bought some Mobil 1 0W-40, a Mann Filter, & an oil filter wrench. I looked up how to change the oil on an E90 & found plenty of posts & how to videos. Then I get ready, drive my car up on to a 2 x 4 so I can get a look see. And there is a metal plate covering the underside of my engine to get to the oil drain plug. In order to get to it, I'm going to have to now find a way to raise the car. Dealers charge a lot of money to repair & maintain European cars. I really don't know how much less expensive using an independent shop would be. They still have to pay competent mechanics a good wage, pay over head, plus parts.Regarding Porsches. My Mom has had her 2011 Cayenne V6 for almost 2 years. She's racked up over 40K miles already & loves it. Maintenance costs are through the roof though (they wanted 300+ to rotate the tires & another $300+ for an alignment). So much so that she has the maintenance done at our local BMW Dealer. "
"graphicguy","December 2012"," nyc....that's crazy costs on your Mom's Cayenne. That said, doing it yourself, unless you have a garage, a lift, specialty tools, etc can prove to be more costly given how the German marques are engineered. I don't know if it's better, or worse. It is more costly, though (as you give a good example of with your foray into changing your own oil).I have an independent guy who's made a good living servicing German cars for the last couple of decades. He has so much business because of the outrageous dealership charges, you have to book him no less than a week in advance...even for a simple oil change.On my 335i, I had him change the oil in-between the ""scheduled"" free oil changes from BMW. BMW gives a basic oil change for $70-$80. My mechanic charges 1/2 that. But, he also doesn't give me loaner car, doesn't have cappuccino in his waiting room, nor any flat screen TVs to watch while you wait. He does have a little greasy tube TV that looks like a relic from a Walmart Black Friday Special, circa 1985.I haven't turned a wrench on any car for quite some time. Whereas, 15 years ago, I could do a complete tear down of a small block, by myself, in an afternoon. "
"stickguy","December 2012"," I could tear one down (assuming you took it out of the car for me!) but I guarantee I would never get it back together again. At least not running. But I always thought it would be fun to get a beater/junker to experiment on. Basically practice with the tools, and see how it all goes together. And then just have the parts taken away in boxes!as to service, if I ever do get an older BMW, there is a very highly regarded indy shop about 3 miles from my house. They are factory trained, very experienced, and supposedly reasonable cost (about what you would pay for any reputable repair shop, and way cheaper than a dealer).they only work on BMW and MB (well, they added Mini now). So I am sure they know what they are looking for before you even show up (all the common failures and gotchas).having them nearby makes me a lot less leery of buying say an E46, and that is where I would go for a PPI. "
"buya","December 2012"," That's about what they want for doing the same thing for LR2 at the dealer here, and it's not included in one of their affordable service plans either.You may find yourself still needing the help of a mechanic after you got the tools and electronic gadget. While it's good to read up and learn the work that might be needed on your car, so you won't get ripped, it's better to let the mechanic do the job because he has more experience than you on the brand (as your post seemed to convey).In my younger days I often thought why can't such mechanically superior European cars be available to everyone to appreciate? Now I see the reason -- repairs and maintenance. The car makers have made their cars affordable to many, but the R & M cost is a reason why some people would take the lease and dump the car when done.It would be wise to shop for a garage that service your BMW. My cars maintained at dealership because the garage guys I used aren't cheaper and not better either. Don't take recommendations for granted, and always price out at dealers and garage both for every job and read the forums for advice. Dealers won't say ""let's try this and see"", but some garage does, and that could be their ways to milk you out of thousands per try until nothing gets done and you wised up.Good Luck. "
"sweendogy","December 2012"," While I have not had a lot of experiance in the matenance aspect of cars- I do have a thought- the g I currently roll in is he longest I've kept a new car- I have had oil changes and breaks done in the car in its 32k miles and 5 years of ownership - while I don't drive a lot and own a low maintence Japanese brand (that was 12k cheaper then it's closest rival) I have learned that dealerships are negotiable - bring in that coupon- tell the service manager you saw the price cheaper- I have and am not ashamed to say I did not pay for the 15k service at 699- I got the tires rotated and oil change for 50bux vs a competitor that they matched- other items I've done ala Cart and also on discount - when they told me it was going to cost 300 per new tires I went to Goodyear and got better tires for half that- The free maintence thing is laughable as an advantage. I'll buy my own wiper blades for 20 bux to save thousands any day.Now only if my Infiniti and the winter gas were on the same page - city mileage has now gone closer to 10 then 20 "
"nyccarguy","December 2012"," That's an excellent point too sweendogy. Just like you did for the car, shop around. So many times the ""xx,xxx mile service"" is nothing more than an oil change with a bunch of ""check this, check that..."" When the tires were shot and needed to be replaced on my Mom's Cayenne, I bought them from a Good Year place for $189 each including mounting and balancing (it was cheaper than tire rack & you don't even want to know what the dealer wanted to charge). While the car was there, they checked the alignment & noticed it was way off, so I had them align the car for $59.99 + tax. "
"nyccarguy","December 2012"," Like I said, I'm going to try it in between the first oil change (this Tuesday) & my next one. There are a few independent mechanics around here that specialize in BMWs that I will check out just in case I do decide to buy the car out when the lease is up.It is nice to get a loaner car when the car goes in for service. I do have my Prelude as my extra car or if worse comes to worse, I can probably rent a cheap car from enterprise for the day and still make out cheaper than bringing it to certain dealers. "
"nyccarguy","December 2012"," I agree completely. I'd like to try it out ""just to say I did it"" type of thing. I've spent close to $100 already on 7 quarts of Mobil 1 0w40, a plastic pan to catch the oil so I can recycle it (and it doesn't mess my garage floor), a Mann Filter, and a special oil filter wrench before I even put once second of my time into this. I also have 3 children (6, 3 1/2, 1) & work 6 days a week (we are open M-F 7:30 AM to 5:00 PM & Saturday 7:30 AM to Noon). "
"habitat1","December 2012"," The free maintence thing is laughable as an advantage. I'll buy my own wiper blades for 20 bux to save thousands any day.Not sure I follow you. In my comparative shopping of a new 2014 Cayman S vs. 2013 BMW M3, it looks like that in addition to a roughly $14k difference in actual purchase price between the two, the 4/50 free maintenance from BMW would cost roughly $3,500 on the Porsche (40k miles is a big one) using the dealer. If I need new brakes during that time, add another $1,500+ BMW advantage. So that ""free"" maintenance on an M3 really adds at least $2-3k in favor of BMW to the M3 vs. Cayman S, even assuming I go independent on the Cayman service. As for Infiniti, that was a real joke between a friend of mine here several years ago. I had a 1995 Maxima, he had a 1996 I30. Exactly the same car mechanically, other than mine was a manual, his an automatic. I spent less at the Nissan dealer on service over 8 years and 120k miles than he spent in 7 years and 60k miles. Take Nissan prices for just about everything, multiply them by 1.5 or 2.0 and call them Infiniti prices. And then come up with a bunch of crap that the Infinii ""needs"", but the Nissan service manager never called for. Hopefully, your dealer experience is a little better than that. "
"stickguy","December 2012"," I have had a 2000 Acura 3.2 TL for about 4 years, and have always taken it to the Honda dealer. they were perfectly happy to service it. I am not even sure what the prices are at the local Acura dealer relative to them. But since until recently I also had 2 Hondas, it was a lot more convenient to get them all serviced at the same place! "
"habitat1","December 2012"," Our hometown PA Acura dealer is more reasonable and o higher integrity than either our DC area Honda and Acura dealer, so we try to have our two serviced there when we are traveling back. The latest sham is ""cracked engine mounts"". Chevy Chase Acura has told us that we need them replaced on both our MDX and TL. Local independent pointed out that the hard rubber mounts always get cosmetic surface cracks after a few years and it has no impact on structural integrity. Based upon our experience, Chevy Chase Acura is slightly above Bernie Madoff on the integrity scale, so if it's not warranty work that Acura covers 100%, we will never go there again. Unfortunately, part of the problem where we live is ""dumb money"" owners that will take their cars to places like Chevy Chase Acura for service, get screwed with excessive charges for suspicious work, and talk about how nice the car wash and vacuum job was. Without realizing that their wallet was vacuumed as well. Final example. Our MDX had a loose hatch latch that caused it to rattle. When in for routine oil change, they quoted my wife $300 to fix it saying it would take 2-3 hours. Another woman in the waiting area had same exact problem. She told them ""sure"" to the repair; my wife said no thanks. Brought the car home and in about 8 minutes flat, armed only with a Phillips screwdriver, I undid the plastic cover around the hinge, found the loose screw that had fallen out of the hinge and replaced it - with a lock washer, this time. I washed my hands, we went out to a nice 2 hour dinner with a bottle of wine and came back $175 ahead.Sorry for the Chevy Chase Acura digression, but for anyone in the DC area, be forewarned. "
"sweendogy","December 2012"," Regarding your post on a porshe and a BMW m3- Prob the reason you are not following me- this is Ellps chat - 14k difference minus the 3500 40k service, really, I'm talking apples to apples - I also mentioned the coupon and shopping around aspect of dealing with regular maintence costs- these cars are basically pretty easy- Gas, oil, tires and pads- most other ""problems"" are covered under the basic for the first 4 years - these cars have the engine upfront & trunk in the back- not vice versa- which I'm guessing makes them more complicated, thus costing more to fix. The Nissan Infiniti statement is funny, wouldn't a good friend tell his buddy - you have a maxima (i30) take it to the Nissan dealer for those oil changes. The upselling in service is not limited to luxury cars btw. "
"habitat1","December 2012"," I concur, the BMW free maintenance is much less of a benefit if you are comparing a 328i to an Acura TL than an M3 to a Cayman. I'll try to stick to ELLPS comparisons. Unfortunately, my friend with the Infiniti lived in Virginia and his closest Nissan dealer was a bit of a crook, as well. My Nissan dealer in Maryland - or perhaps just the ""red team"" service manager I was assigned to when I bought my car - was very honorable and reasonably priced. Unfortunately, dealership changed ownership and he retired a few years ago, so that's no longer the case. You are right again about upselling service not being limited to luxury cars. A couple of years ago, the local TV station did an undercover sting and caught the VW dealer charging for additional services that were not only unnecessary, but they didn't actually perform. Idiots tried to charge one elderly customer for an air conditioning recharging service on an older car that didn't have A/C. "
"tlong","December 2012"," Our hometown PA Acura dealer is more reasonable and o higher integrity than either our DC area Honda and Acura dealer, so we try to have our two serviced there when we are traveling back. I was driving to Orange County, CA to do some repeated consulting and my '05 TL started developing a power steering noise. I took it into a local Acura dealer where I had never been, figuring I would be out a few hundred $$ to get it fixed. I was SHOCKED that this was, by far, the best dealer service experience I have ever had. They writer was very nice, and he wanted the mechanic to hear the noise, so he had him ride along with me in my car (!!!). Then I got a ride to work. At the end of the day, I went to pick up the car and they fixed it FREE! They implied an o-ring might not have been installed correctly, so no charge! And they also torqued some bolts in the suspension to see if that would eliminate a creak I had. Top it off with a car wash, all at no cost.They could have easily taken me for a ride, and I wasn't even a local customer. Tustin Acura in CA. "
"habitat1","December 2012"," Too bad they are 2,500 miles from me. Was the car still under warranty at the time? "
"tlong","December 2012"," Too bad they are 2,500 miles from me. Was the car still under warranty at the time?No, over 100K on the car. "
"graphicguy","December 2012"," tlong....great experience from that dealer. I've always said, whether it's the most basic Civic, or the most expensive TL, the dealer will either make or break the owner's opinion of that particular brand.Several years ago, my Mother had a Cadillac STS that was under warranty, and at the time, the selling dealer was really taking her for a ""stooge"". She got me involved and I started questioning everything they charged her for that was supposed to be warranty work. As I started to find more and more malfeasance with this particular dealer, I decided to file lemon law on behalf of my Mother. Long and short of it, after many fights (since the Caddy dealer tried to deny they charged for work that should have been taken care of under warranty), GM agreed to buy the car back.I swore I'd never buy a Cadillac for as long as I lived (and have stuck to that promise). Cadillac lost two customers (probably more given my negative word of mouth) over one dealership's service dept. "
"sweendogy","December 2012"," I agree dealership experience is important - I like not having to go to the dealership at all-'or as few times as possible - "
"jg88","December 2012"," My process is to only have the dealer do warranty work on a new car. The exception -- oil/fluid changes while under warranty. All wheel/tire work is done by a chain -- when I get a new car I buy a lifetime alignment package that will include free rotations. Every 5k, the car is aligned, tires rotated. I usually max out on tread life that way. I would never consider buying a tire from the dealer either -- there are too many companies who will beat their price all day long. Ford comes closest to offering reasonable tire prices from their dealers, the rest are 30+% higher, or more.I concur with the ""dumb money"" theories -- dealers will overcharge as much as they can. Once out of warranty, I go to independents who may specialize in certain types of cars as they are usually ex-dealer folks who go out on their own. "
"buya","December 2012"," Very smart. My advisor on whichever car it was said their dealership sends their cars out for things like alignments, and so I took mine to a garage chain and paid $99 for it. I'd only need 1 alignment on my cars if any at all, and if the lifetime alignment package is more than $99, it'd be too much. But the service pack is a smart thing for those who need alignment a lot. One time an advisor ignored the alignment request because he said my car didn't need it, and the shaft can only be aligned so many times. Didn't know how true that was. Tire rotation is a must and it should be front and back rotate on normal tires, but left and right switch for staggered. But go to the garage or gas station garage that has the right size and ""star"" tools for your car! "
"buya","December 2012"," Dealers charging for services they did not perform. Absolutely! Think my dad had been routinely charged for services that never made at the dealership where he purchased his car, so I took mine to that dealership for check up and lo-&-behold they said some parts needed to be replaced. I asked for the bad part held for my inspection and the advisor shown me a greasy part near the back door to their shop. That was the last time we bought a car from that dealership nearly - ahem - 20 years ago.My preference is to cultivate a relationship with my advisor and head tech at the dealership and not have to try a garage after warranty is over and redo the same service at the dealers. "
"habitat1","December 2012"," but left and right switch for staggered.Don't think that works for most cars. Virtually every vehicle I've owned or shopped that has staggered wheel sizes also has ""unidirectional"" tires with an inside and outside. Meaning that all four corners are unique and they cannot be rotated. If you try to put a left front on the right front you will either end up having the outside sidewall facing the inside or the tire will be rotating the opposite direction intended. Not sure what happens if you put a unidirectional tire on backwards (i.e. rolling in opposite direction intended) but don't think I want to find out on a new Porsche or BMW. If the tires are not unidirectional, no problem, but that's the exception based upon the cars I know that have staggered wheel sizes (i.e. usually higher performance models). "
"flightnurse","December 2012"," BTW, oil change for my BMW is about $10 more then the local indie shop charges, and the Indie shop wont give me a free loaner... I'll pay the extra $10 for a free car. "
"flightnurse","December 2012"," This is not a problem on cars that do not have staggered wheel sizes, like TL's or G's, BMW and or MB. My BMW 330 has staggered and ""unidirectional"" tires and really haven't had a need to ""rotate"" them..So hows the 911 or Cayman shopping? Was at the LA Auto show, very much liked what Porsche has done to the Cayman and Boxster, but have a hard time justifying the price for a new one. Currently I only drive my personal car roughly 5-6K/YR, can't get into paying $850/m lease on a new Boxster S. "
"habitat1","December 2012"," I've put down a deposit to secure the #1 spot on a dealer list for the 2014 Cayman S. Earliest I would get the car would be late April, according to the latest release information. My ""build your own"" price on the Porsche website works out to an MSRP of $80k. We'll see; I can't place the order until Porsche gives the dealers the go ahead, which won't likely be until January. The only way I can do a purchase like this is to bite the bullet and pay cash. Do not want to be reminded of the frivolity of it all every month.On the tire thing, I think on 50/50 balanced RWD cars like the 330i, the tires naturally wear pretty evenly. It's on FWD cars with 60%+ of the weight on the fronts and the fronts doing both the steering and the driving that they wear considerably faster than the rears. Maybe my TL should have reverse staggering? "
"buya","December 2012"," Great point! I almost forgot the unidirectional thing! I had the staggered tires switched in a sedan type performance car and no one said anything to me. But that was back in younger days. The more recent sport car had one direction tires and the garage guy explained that to me too when he can't switch those tires. I thought it was just a Michelin thing. Less work, no complaints. It's all going to be history! Nice cars still appeal to me, but it's like vegans appreciating farm animals. I'm opting for a no fuss no muss use-and-toss car that is decent to drive and no batch concerns. Working on finding such wonder car at the moment.Good driving, good fun and good luck to all of you who desire or drive European cars or performance cars. "
"nyccarguy","December 2012"," So I took my 2011 328xi in for service and was hoping to get an F30 328i or X3 with the 4cyl turbo as a loaner car. As luck would have it, the loaner I did get is a 2011 E90 335d. I've never driven a diesel before and I am impressed to say the least.You definitely hear the diesel clatter at idle and at low speeds, but the 335d doesn't stay at low speeds for very long. Passing power in this car at highway speeds is completely 100% effortless. The engine is smooth at high speeds and you'd be hard pressed to notice you are driving a diesel on the highway. Now the bad part. I attribute this to the tires that have almost 39,000 miles on them and are close to shot, the car's 425 lb ft of torque, and the rain slicked roads, but I saw the stability control light flicker a lot more than it does in my car. I really don't know if I can do without AWD here in Connecticut.The dealer I bought my car from and service it at (not the closest) is about 34 miles away from my house. On the 98% highway drive, I averaged over 35 mpg doing well over 70 most of the way. "
"stickguy","December 2012"," I love diesels, and had quite a bit of seat time in one while my son was in HS (which shocking to me was 4 years ago). Huge torque. Still pretty slow though.

Though I know the trunk on my was way bigger! "
"nyccarguy","December 2012"," I know all about those. Our truck we have for deliveries is a 2006 Mitsubishi FUSO FE180 with a 4 cyl turbo diesel and 6 speed Automatic, & 14' box. Its not that fast and get crummy gas mileage:)Gonna give the 335d a workout on my way into work tomorrow AM:) "

"habitat1","December 2012"," Too bad BMW killed the 335d in 2011, and even worse, never offered a 535d here. I think that would have made a lot of sense.We get 30+ mpg on a highway cruise with our 5,300 lb X5d. Friend of mine made it back and forth from DC to Wilmington NC last summer in his 335d averaging 40+ mpg. According to him, the actual real world fuel economy of the 335d is considerably better than the new 328i (which his sister got, since the 335d isn't available). That coincides with our experience - in similar heavy city mix, our X5d gets 21 mpg and our 2005 MDX gets under 14 mpg. That's a real world 7+ mpg, 50%+ advantage, even though the EPA city ratings are only 2 mpg / 12% better (19 vs. 17). Now if I could only get my hands on one of these: M550d Sedan "
"sweendogy","December 2012"," I'm amazed that a dealer would loan a diesel in the first place, never mind one with 39k miles and with bald tires no less - I don't think I've ever been in a rental car with more then 25k miles - and dealer loaners I've seen are usually under 10k. I also have never driven a d- and would like no one day - one with that power and heritage must be cool. "
"habitat1","December 2012"," I'm amazed that a dealer would loan a diesel in the first place, never mind one with 39k miles and with bald tires no less Ha! You should have seen what I got a couple of years ago. Took my Acura in to my hometown Acura/Mercedes dealer for what was supposed to be an alignment and state inspection. Turned out that I had a couple of bent rims and the dealer needed to keep the car overnight. All regular loaners were out, so the owner gave me his 1980's vintage, pristinely restored 300SDL with about 200k miles on the odometer. Talk about a tank. It wasn't very quick, but it could have gone through a brick wall without slowing down. "
"flightnurse","December 2012"," Does Porsche have a European Delivery option? If so take it... "
"nyccarguy","December 2012"," Even just putting the gas mileage aside as an added bonus, the power that the 335d & your X5d produce is phenomenal.I would consider the cost differential as an engine upgrade. I don't think I could justify it for the fuel economy savings alone.I drove the car this AM to work and sat in some heavy traffic when I first got on I95, then on The Bruckner closer to my store, plus some crazy slow going on the local streets here in the Bronx. I've travelled a little over 65 miles so far & even with the traffic, my avg mpg is between 30 & 31. That is still a solid 10 mpg over what I average with the 328xi. "
"nyccarguy","December 2012"," They do, but it costs EXTRA unlike BMW's ED Program. "
"robr2","December 2012"," Does Porsche have a European Delivery option? If so take it...They do. Luckily this year they stopped charging extra to pick it up at the factory but other than transportation from the airport to the factory and a tour, they don't offer some of the benefits like Volvo and BMW - discounts, plane fare, hotel, meals, et al.But it's a Porsche.... "
"nyccarguy","December 2012"," Usually loaners do have low mileage on them & the dealers sell em off after 10K or so miles. Maybe this was some sort of ""program car"" or ""BMW executive driven car"" that they picked up on the cheap. I'll ask later.How much attention does the dealer pay to its loaner fleet? Someone turned the car in before me & the girl at the desk just checks the gas gauge. I'm sure nobody notices or bothers to tell if there is a problem.I happen to NOTICE EVERYTHING when it comes to cars. I checked the tires just now (it was dark when I left this AM) & the rears are down to the wear bars. Fronts still have some life left in them. I think the loaner needs an alignment & and also has a front left tire out of balance. My MOM once got a Cayenne S loaner from the dealer that was a 2008 with over 60K. "
"flightnurse","December 2012"," The reason why a 535d was not imported was simple, price. A fully loaded 535d would run close to $65K. The 335d was just something that BMW wanted to see if it would sell, it did, but BMW never fully suppoted it as far as ad time. BMW will be importing a diesel in the 3 series as well as X3 started in the first quarter of 2013, MB will be importing a GLK230 (a diesel) that is suppose to get 40 MPG on the highway and make 395lbs of torque. Now Habitat when you went to the BMW dealer to get your X5 were you in the market for the X5d or did the fact that BMW was offering the Eco credit which brought down the price of the X5d to the price of a X5 the factor you got the diesel over the gasser? "
"flightnurse","December 2012"," Not really, it is up to the dealer on what they use as rentals. I have had 530i, 325i wagon, as well as 330 convertible. I decided once to take my BMW to Scottsdale BMW and the guy ahead of me was given 750i as a loaner. So if I had gotten to the dealer 5 minutes earlier I would have had that 750i. I agree that cars should not have ""worn"" tires, but I can tell you those 335d have a easy time wearing out rear tires, all of the car mag's who had a 335d as one for a year stated that with 415 lbs of torque eat rear tires... "
"flightnurse","December 2012"," Oh right, forgot about that.... It's a Porsche... :confuse: "
"flightnurse","December 2012"," LOL !!!! I had a 1987 300SDL in 1989 bought it from San Diego MB, it had 17K miles on it. To this date it was the BEST highway cruiser I have owned. As you stated it was quick off the line, however, once you got above 10 mph it picked up steam, use to drive it to vegas from San Diego, on highway 15 I would put the car on cruise at 90 (that was the unofficial speed limited between Barstow and Vegas.) I would average 22 mpg and you couldn't tell you were going that fast. The leg room in the back was incredible and never had a complaint about it. The W126's and W140s were tanks, built better then the current W221. "
"robr2","December 2012"," What I meant is that if one is willing to pay for a Porsche (with the associated over the top option prices), then the cost of flying one's self to Europe isn't a big deal. "
"flightnurse","December 2012"," Same thing can be said about BMW,s when one orders a 650 4dr coupe, costing 103K, I think they can afford to fly to Europe too. But the whole Ed program is about driving YOUR car in europe and having it shipped back.. The discount is nice too. The 7 series that we build was priced $83K, that was before the ED price, which was $5K less so $77K would have been the price (special note, for 2013, the M sport package is free on the 740i, BMW will give you credit if you order it.) Yes, BMW goes give air fare but the restrictions on it aren't to my liking, and you can not upgrade using miles to first class or even Business. Also doesn't matter if you can afford 103K or $77K for a car, saving 5K on the car is a great program. "
"robr2","December 2012"," But the whole Ed program is about driving YOUR car in europe and having it shipped back.. The discount is nice too. Oh I completely understand that although I once had a co-worker take a side trip to Sweden to take delivery of a Volvo for a friend who didn't want the trip.I've looked at the Volvo program as that is the one I would most likely take advantage of.Their discount is about 8% off of MSRP. They include 2 round trip tickets tickets, one night's stay at a hotel in Gotheburg, transportation between the airport/hotel/delivery center and a Swedish meatball lunch at the delivery center.Sometimes, Volvo might have extra vehicles ready for factory delivery without an order and will toss some extra incentives on them. Further Volvo allows the buyer to pick and choose options outside of packages on a Euro delivery. "
"dino001","December 2012"," The only issue is Volvos sell at deep discounts with large amounts of incentives (at least recently) thrown at them, especially in form of dealer's incentives. Apples to apples, you may get actually lower price here than ED fixed price, so the benefit is the fare, one hotel night, dinner and ""free rental"" for two weeks. One could assign a price for it, so a comparison can be made whether it still is a good deal or not, moneywise. I suspect it's a financial break even plus experience and extra expense for the rest of the trip.I had similar thing on BMW - the dealer was not as eager to discount on ED, there was additional coupon on US delivery, so ED price was not really as attractive, basically about same, maybe $1000 lower than US street (final) price and I still had to buy a ticket. I also did not get best financing offer, either, as I had to rely on dealer's offer (no bank will give you a loan on car without a title, it is the dealer who needs to vouch for you). The terms weren't bad, just not ""best"" I refinanced the car right out of the US Customs' gates (at the time I booked 3.8%, refinanced into 2.6% APR).But experience is what counts. 138 mph on the autobahn (could not quite get to the top speed, not enough of runway), Rhein river castles, Aachen and Cologne Cathedrals... PLUS Performance Center delivery (one night w/ dinner and breakfast at Sheraton, half day at their circuits in Spartanburg). What was even better, I took the US (Spartanburg) delivery on December 23. Talking about perfect timing.  :shades:  Considering that I'm fussy on options (really fussy), I'd special order regardless, which would limit my barganinig power anyway. "

But if you wanted to go to Europe and planned on buying a Volvo, it might be a better deal.I had similar thing on BMW - the dealer was not as eager to discount on ED...Another positive on the Volvo ED - they have a published price that can't be negotiated. The dealer is paid a flat amount by Volvo to process the paperwork and prep for delivery once it reaches them. With all the other ED programs, one still has to negotiate the price.Considering that I'm fussy on options (really fussy), I'd special order regardless, which would limit my barganinig power anyway.In reality, ordering normally affords greater bargaining power. Dealer doesn't have to worry about paying floor plan on the car - it's punched as a sold unit ASAP. Selling it at invoice is probably more profitable for the dealer than selling over invoice on stock units. "
"habitat1","December 2012"," Now Habitat when you went to the BMW dealer to get your X5 were you in the market for the X5d or did the fact that BMW was offering the Eco credit which brought down the price of the X5d to the price of a X5 the factor you got the diesel over the gasser?I had an interest in the X5d for at least a year or two. The fact that they increased the eco credit to $4,500 in June, just as my daughter was getting her driving license and we could use another vehicle was good timing all around. If I hadn't gone for the X5d, it wouldn't have been a X5 3.5i instead. It would have been a Cayenne V6 6-speed manual. Had a deal to get one of those at a great discount that put it about the same pice as the X5d. "
"dino001","December 2012"," It certainly doesn't look that way in my experiences. Instant gratification seems to be most powerful motivator. It is strenghtened by dealer's incentives based on deliveries in next month. If you make an order to be filled two or three months from now, the dealer cannot factor any marketing support money that is expiring in two weeks. So you can get a price closer to nominal invoice, but if there is grand or two of dealer incentive (not consumer rebate) expiring last day of current month, that is not going to be part of the equation in special order. "
"habitat1","December 2012"," but if there is grand or two of dealer incentive (not consumer rebate) expiring last day of current month, that is not going to be part of the equation in special order.Think that may be case by case. My BMW dealer claims I can get the same near invoice deal from them on a custom order BMW M3 if I order by 12/31 as they would be able to give me on one of two that they have in stock on the showroom floor. I would still get the holiday and loyalty credits that expire 1/1/13, even though I wouldn't be picking up the car until March. They are still trying to tempt me away from a Porsche and I have to admit, the price on a new 2013 M3 is a heck of a deal, especially given the opportunity to custom order and pick up in Spartanburg. "
"rmorin1249","December 2012"," Go to the European Delivery forum on bimmerfest. There are plenty of dealers that will negotiate up from European Delivery INVOICE pricing. You can usually order a car from between $500 and $1000 over ED invoice. This translates to about an11% discount from US MSRP. "
"habitat1","December 2012"," That is correct, ED prices are negotiable....except, I do not believe there is any ED discount on ""M"" models, and obviously ED is not available on the BMW models made here in the US (X3/5/6). In addition, on some hard to get models, as in the initial introduction of the three series hardtop convertible, an ED order does not get charged against the dealers allocation, so they view it as an bonus sale and will be more aggressive in discounting ED than a US delivery car out of their limited allocation.

I do remember that the dealer was happy to do the ED for me since the ZHP cars were limited production and at the time, my car was now counted in their regular allotment. Now times might have changed and ED cars might be counted towards dealers allotment. But I remember last year when looking at the 5 and 7 series we were told that ED cars were not counted as part of their allotment. I haven't looked at Volvo's or MB's programs, but I do like the fact with BMW you can set up delivery at their performance center and have fun on their track there. "

Tuned out a bit on the Volvo section but all in all good show. Would also like to add the diesal chat very interesting as well. Less gas more torque sporty sedan always interesting. Does anyone think we will be using gas or diesal in the next 10 years, or is this new fusion technology Going to take over? "
"nyccarguy","December 2012"," Ok, so all is well after my 2011 328xi's 1st service. ECU was re-flashed which got rid of the cold start revving, a loose wire was found to be the trouble of the tail light on the left rear trunk causing the light to flicker, the hinges on the hood were adjusted so it is now aligned properly, & a faulty trunk latch will be replaced in about 3 weeks when the part arrives. The car was washed & vacuumed (believe me, it needed it).So I've got a few parting comments about the 335d they gave me as a loaner car. Between Monday night and tonight, I put 231 miles on the diesel loaner. The needle was at the 1/2 mark when I filled up and it said I still had over 300 miles until empty. I did a little more highway driving than normal because I had to drive my Grandma home after dinner (about 25 miles) and then return the loaner (another 28 miles). I filled up with Diesel that was $4.33 per gallon. Super at the same station was $4.19 per gallon. I did see another station that was selling diesel for $4.59 and Super for $4.29.In 231 miles, I averaged 42.3 mph & 32.2 mpg. I was driving normally and not trying to get good gas mileage, it just happened. I hopped into my 328xi and headed back home. I backed into the driveway and checked my trip computer. 38.8 mph average speed. 21.5 mpg.Both cars have their positives and negatives.The 335d obviously has a HUGE advantage when it comes to power (425 lb ft of torque - ARGH, ARGH, ARGH) and fuel economy (pretty much 10 mpg better real world). The passing power this car has is just unreal. Push down on the throttle and it just goes. Pulls like a freight train.My 328xi's steering is actually heavier than the RWD 335d. Handling was hard to judge because I was driving a car with tires that NEEDED to be replaced and it is someone else's $50K + BMW that I didn't want to wrap around a tree or telephone pole. The 425 lb ft of torque, RWD, & balding tires made the car's wet weather traction squirmy. I even saw the DTC light flicker a few times on dry pavement.My 328xi was noticeably quieter and smoother than the 335d. The around town diesel clatter didn't bother me, but the car's N52 Inline 6 just sings and loves to rev.The verdict. The diesel motor is just incredible. The fuel economy it gives is just an added bonus. For me to put one in my driveway would most certainly cost me more than the buyout on my 328xi, plus I'd have to invest in a set of dedicated winter wheels & tires, and possibly get a used winter beater (Jeep or Subaru).The other diesel cars on the market either won't match up to the way my 328xi drives (VW Passat, Jetta, Golf TDI are all FWD) or they are A LOT more money (X5s aren't cheap, even used). It has peaked my interest to give a 4 cyl BMW diesel a chance (X1, X3, 3 series) assuming they are out when my lease is up in September 2014. "

We don't know what he would have gotten on the trip since in the whole 5 years of ownership we never took it out of PHX "

"dino001","December 2012"," Well, using your key, C250 should also be called C180. BMWs naming convention is done on purpose. It is based on what a benchmark naturally aspirated engine should be to match its power.

"koctailz","December 2012"," I test drove both of these cars and found the Accord to blow the TSX away. They are both priced similarly, but I think the Accord can be had for $1 or $2K less than the TSX. The Accord has much much more power vs the TSX and better fuel economy with the cylinder deactivation on freeway. The Accord ride is refined yet it handles decently. The TSX ride is jittery. The TSX probably does handle better at the limit, but who drives like that anyway? The Accord is a 6 speed auto and TSX is 5 speed auto. The interior of the TSX is maybe a touch nicer, but with the Accord you get a backup camera without having to pay for NAV. With the TSX you have to get the NAV to get the backup camera. After comparing these I don't see any reason to buy the TSX. Am I missing something? I even think the 4 cylinder Accord is a much better value than the TSX. "
"sweendogy","December 2012"," Now take the same agrument and add the v6 accord and the standard tl. Same power - prob less refind but for the doh pretty similar I would guess. (Have?t driven the new accord.)Acura is the new Buick of Lux cars. Yes I said it 4 years ago and I'll say it again "
"koctailz","December 2012"," i haven't driven the tl either, but the specs between the v6 accord and the tl are pretty close. i do think the refreshed tl is a nice looking car, but totally overpriced. the SH AWD would be the tl to get but i have no use for AWD where I live. I do understand that the TSX is going to get dumped and there is going to be something called a TLX? Acura definitely needs to refresh these sedans with the introduction of the new 13 Accord. "
"sweendogy","December 2012"," The refreshed TL is better looking then it was - but for me personally its not enuf to get me salivating. Acura (honda) knew there was a problem with the TLs (dealers were telling them) from the beginning and they waited to long- they did not make the same mistake with the civic and quickly fixed the problem. "
"flightnurse","December 2012"," First off I hope everybody had a good holiday.... It's been nice having 3 weeks off, this has allowed me to do come clinical work, at times I do miss bedside nursing.So as some of you or most of know I have had my 330i up for sale, I placed only on the web, and at a higher price then what normal 2005 330i ZPH cars have been selling for. Since I am not in a rush to sell it so I figured I would place a higher price on mine. It was listed for 23K, with only 59K miles on it. After 4 months and many phone calls mostly by people who were trying to get my lower it down to the high teens. I received a call right before we left for San Diego for Thanksgiving, between myself getting that bug going around, and the potential buyer getting sick it was tough to connect, however, we connected, we meet up at a local BMW dealer, I figured this was safe for all involved. The guy lets call him Tommy, was waiting for me at the dealership when I pulled up. We chatted a bit, and went for a test drive, after 30 minuted we came back tot he dealership, I had the service manage pull up all the service records and warranty work that had been on the car. I had all my paperwork with me with all the work done on the car from BMW, and Autobahn Autosport (our local Dinan Authorized Dealer.) He was impressed with the car and all the paperwork I had, I even had the German Plates from the Euro Del and paper work from the shipping company. We parted way, and I he told me he was going to call me before Xmas. So a week before Xmas received a call telling me that he wanted me car and he wanted to offer me 20K for it. I countered back with 21K and it was a deal. I have a pay pal account set up, so he paid for the car this way, once the money was in my account, we meet (today 12-27-12) and I signed the paperwork over to Tommy. I'm sort of sad that I sold my beloved 2005 BMW 330i with the ZPH package, however, I thought I did well with it, I bought it for $45K, and sold it for 21K. I added about 5K of Dinan products to the car.So now I'm carless, but this is OK, so I get to go looking at cars, Have my eye on a couple of 2008-09 Boxster S's...Anyhow, I hope everybody has a wonderful new years... "
"graphicguy","December 2012"," FN....cool. I had an '06 330i before the TL and my current 335i. I never understood why BMW didn't use that version of the 3.0 (255 HP non turbo) in the 328i, instead of the previous 225 HP 6 cyl or the 240 HP 4cyl they currently use.A major snow storm hit my 'burg earlier in the week. Both the S4 and the 335i handled it with aplomb. It was very impressive given these cars' intended drivers.We never once felt the AWD systems (quattro in the S4, ""x"" in the 335i) doing their work, even in 6 inches of snow with an icy crust.Happy New Year to all of my friends here in ELLPS.

"flightnurse","December 2012"," Graphic I can not answer that question the 255hp 3.0 was/is a great engine, it made 20 more HP then my car, I think BMW wanted a bigger different between the 328 and 335.I've been waiting to hear from you in regards to the snowstorm and the Audi.. "

"nyccarguy","December 2012"," You've got me confused with din001. He's got the Sport Pkg, Stick, 328i Wagon. I've got an E90 328xi sedan.But since you asked... My car handles absolutely brilliant in the snow. We just had a nasty 2-3"" with an icy coating the other day. My car went on like it was 80 degrees and sunny. Yes I played around with it a little bit. I shut off the stability control and did some beautiful doughnuts in an empty doctor's office parking lot. I shut the stability control off again and did a power slide onto my street.I really do LOVE my car. It suits my needs perfectly. My 2 big problems are: 1. My wife likes it too and complained to me last night that she doesn't get to drive it enough (implying I need to take her Pilot at least once a week).2. What I'm going to do when the lease is up. After 15,000 + miles in 9 months, I don't think I'm going to find anything that drives remotely like it (even at it's inflated residual value) when the lease is up. "
"stickguy","December 2012"," instead of getting it at an inflated residual, you might do well with one of the other 400,000 2011s that will be coming off lease. May not be quite as loaded, but you could get (possibly) a much lower mile version CPO, for the same price as yours non-CPO. Getting on with 3 years/30K on it, means you would have another 3/70 warranty to play with, which should work with how you use it. "
"nyccarguy","December 2012"," It's actually funny how alike we think. I kinda had thoughts along the same line and started looking at prices of '08, '09, & '10 used & CPO cars after I posted my comment. I'm actually willing to take a less loaded car. Features that are a must are AWD, heated seats, 17"" wheels (there are some 16""s on '09s & '10s that are horrible looking IMHO), Automatic, & Adaptive Xenon headlights.There will definitely be a TON of E90 328xis out there when my lease is up to choose from. Only 1 will be MINE though. But for a substantial discount with a CPO warranty, less mileage, & cheapo financing, I might have to look to another 3er (just don't tell my car). "
"sweendogy","December 2012"," ""But for a substantial discount with a CPO warranty""I would go for any discount to your car to get the added protection of the cpo. Sure someone else drove the car before you but they also took car of the car with bmws ""free"" maintence plan like you are enjoying now. I also thing that cars will be easy to come by, a low mileage well equipped xi in the NYC area won't be hard to find. They are more common in town here then a ford. (All fords)The other thought would be to try to negotiate with the lender maybe there is flex on pricing- who knows. Can't believe you are worrying / talking about this now after just signing the lease. "
"fedlawman","December 2012"," I think you did well flightnurse Congrats! "
"nyccarguy","December 2012"," You are right about the fact that there are a ton of E90 328xis out there to choose from. I'll find the right one, for sure. You are also right about the fact that I shouldn't be worried about what's next considering I have another 21 months to go. It was just a thought that popped into my head at that particular moment.I'm definitely open to buying a CPO car that's a year or 2 older than my '11 with less miles to save a decent chunk of change compared to buying out my lease.We'll see what happens. "
"stickguy","December 2012"," don't forget, if you are buying it out, you are just financing a used car. Often they have those deals on the CPO with super cheap rates, or they pay the first 3 payments. "
"stickguy","December 2012"," but my BIL has a current generation BMW 550. Might be a 2010? Anyway, barely 25K on it, and tires are shot. To replace the OEM runflats was going to cost 2K. Ouch. Given that he hates the run flats anyway, he ordered a comparable normal tire, and that is going to only run about 1K, and likely have much better ride and handling characteristics. And for the savings, he will risk running without a spare! Just have to wait for the flatbed if the worst happens.I told him to just find a donut and a jack, and stash them in the trunk. I doubt that he ever uses the trunk anyway, so losing a little trunk space isn't going to matter. "
"nyccarguy","December 2012"," We're supposed to get about 5 inches of snow tomorrow. Should make for a fun drive home from work tomorrow afternoon. "
"stickguy","December 2012"," down by philly we should just be getting rain.Just spent the holidays in upstate NY, so saw plenty of snow (we got about 12"" Wednesday/Thursday). We came home tonight instead of tomorrow since odds are the drive down through the storm would have been a nightmare!Have to say though, in the little bit of snow driving (on a semi-plowed driveway) the RDX went through it like it was a drive road.

No problems. I'm not doing any full throttle burnouts. Nor am I trying to do an doughnuts. But, driving normally, no issues at all. Had a tiny scare when I had to stand on the brakes for some idiot who was going up a snowy hill (without getting a head start and no momentum) and started to slide backwards. I didn't feel ABS through the pedal, but could tell the tires were grabbing-releasing in quick succession. Tragedy averted (although the driver in front of me ended up in the median).335 ix has done very well, too.I wouldn't hesitate to take either car out in any weather short of blizzard conditions.I'm being chastised for posting and not getting ready for dinner.

"flightnurse","January 2013"," OK, I'm sitting in the US Airways Lounge in Charlotte waiting for my flight home (I missed the earlier flight) and was reading some of my Bimmerfest forums, of course some people are talking about how the Germans and Asian car companies are going to make the upcoming CAFE #'s. The consensuses is Diesel is going to be the way. I have to agree, We know that BMW will be bring over 4 cyl oil burn, same with MB and Audi will use a higher HP version of thier 4 cyl oil burn in thier cars. Mazda has been teasing the auto mag's in regards to their SkyActive D (diesel) engine. Mazda hasn't confirmed or denied that the diesel is coming to the states, but from what people have stated, it will. If this is true, I'm sure this will open the door for other Asian brands to import them. So what is everybodies take on this? What will Porsche do to meet these tougher CAFE requirement? Import a diesel 911??? "
"m6user","January 2013"," Yes, Mazda has definitely stated that the diesel is coming in the latter part of this year in the new Mazda6. I was just at a Mazda dealer a few days ago and they confirmed it. It's been confirmed in many of the Mazda6 reviews as well. The new Mazda6 just went on sale a few days ago with the gas engine only. the diesel is projected to arrive around the Oct-Nov timeframe. The CX-5 is also planned to get the diesel but it has not been confirmed yet as to timeframe. They will probably see how the diesel sells in the Mazda6 since the CX-5 is selling like hotcakes with the 2.0 gas engine already. Now that the new 2014 CX-5 is going to get the 2.5l engine it will probably appeal to an even broader market as the only real complaint anybody had about the current CX-5 was that it neeeded a little more zoom-zoom which the larger engine will provide. "
"habitat1","January 2013"," I don't know how the CAFE rules work and guess I should research this myself before commenting. But it seems to me that this is government regulation run amok. If there is a ""cost"" to natural resources or our defense budget because of our dependence upon petroleum, then charge a gas tax that covers it. And let consumers decide whether they are going to pay for the privilege of driving a Ferrari instead of a Prius. But the idea of forcing all/some manufacturers to limit consumer choices to achieve some CAFE target is a little f-ed up, IMO. Some people choose to live 50 miles outside of DC so they can have a 4,000 s.f. tract house on a 1/2 acre lot in a subdivision and others choose to pay twice as much for a 2,000 s.f. house close in so they can spend more time in it and less time in their cars commuting. Shall we tell homebuilders that they have to meet a certain corporate commuting time target?? I could drive a Ferrari 599 for my commute and burn less gas annually than the ex-urbanite that does 100 miles roundtrip in a Prius. What these bored government regulators really need to do is to kill Obama Care and take everyones tax bill and increase by the percentage that corresponds to the amount they are overweight. Double the penalty for any dependent children that are overweight. We'd end up with a balanced budget next year and a healthier country in a few more. Sorry, way off topic. I'll do some CAFE research at the Cafe this weekend. "
"dino001","January 2013"," During my family visit in the Old Country this Xmas, I drove my dad's Audi A4 1.9TDI (2005, I think). Would never switch my 328i for it (or previous WRX/STI, or any other good gasoline engine), not in milion years. The clacking sound is still something to get used to. I appreciate better fuel economy and torque, but everything else is better on a good gasoline engine: sound (as for pleasure of well-running engine), noise level, vibrations, weight. Yes, the torque is higher on diesel, but it lasts for 1000 rpm and then it's gone - and when it's gone and you forget to shift, you get run over. May not be such a problem for those new 7-, 8- speed automatic transmissions, but my dad's A4 had 6-speed manual. I love manual transmissions, but not on diesels, apparently - you end up shifting back and forth, always caught on wrong gear (car stops accelerating after the torque peak in merging/passing, or it starts vibrating when left on too high gear for current speed - often issue in city driving). No, diesels are not such a pleasure as some may like you believe. Some of those issues may be (have already been) overcome on newer models, but in my opinion diesel engine belongs to tractor trailers and other heavy duty workhorse machines, not for passenger cars. SUVs - maybe. "

"m6user","January 2013"," In 2001 I was in Italy a couple of weeks for business and drove some kind of small minivan like vehicle. I can't even remember the make but it was diesel and a manual transmission(5 spd I think). I was impressed with how quiet and smooth it was. I didn't find the torque disappearing and remember driving around lake Garda and the curvy roads enjoying the scenery and shifting through the gears. Freeways were also worry free. I remember being passed by a Smart on the freeway at about 150 klicks and saying ""holy crap, I wouldn't go that fast in that thing!""Point is, I think it depends on the particular diesel engine. I also believe I would try at a least a couple of modern diesels with 7-8 spd auto trannies before I made a blanket statement that all diesels belong in semis or farm tractors. "
"buya","January 2013"," Thank you. That was a helpful review. I almost forgot the turbo diesel lag that I felt in the bimmer I once had a fraction of a century ago. It was a good car, but the lag was still felt at times. And diesel wasn't widely available at regular gas stations either. There's no reason for me to reconsider buying a diesel yet, and if it's mpg I'm after, I may consider a reliable hybrid like Prius. I was about to reconsider turbo diesel cars. So thanks again.How do you guys feel about the Lexus 300h? Is it a prettied up Camry hybrid? Which would you buy? "
"dino001","January 2013"," Perhaps you're right, but VAG's 1.9TDI (previous gen 4-cylinder diesel) was a highly acclaimed motor, a special favorite in high-mileage used car markets, like my Old Country's (Poland). My dad's is abot 100k miles, which is nothing for those engines. Granted, that engine is also an older-generation, developed prior common rail technology. It is known for high durability and good resistance to abuse due to substandard fuels and hard working conditions. All great, but the price was noise, vibrations and short torque curve.The new enviro-friendly diesels are known for overcoming many of those issues (lower noise, not as much vibrations, better power delivery), but the price paid is steep - high maintenance and much reduced durability. So, if having to choose between noisy durable diesel, or quiet fragile diesel, I choose gasoline engine. I think many Americans confuse marriage of reason between Europeans and diesel with some kind of love without limits. Europeans opt for diesels mostly because their governments push them to do so by taxes on both vehicles and fuel and because diesels to get better gas mileage. In the world of fuel priced at $6-8, a lawn mower may be attractive for people mover. "
"ivan_99","January 2013"," What will Porsche do to meet these tougher CAFE requirement? Import a diesel 911???I think the average would be included in VW total...so the Golf's, Jetta's, etc would do the heavy CAFE lifting... "
"habitat1","January 2013"," Would never switch my 328i for it (or previous WRX/STI, or any other good gasoline engine), not in milion years.Not sure comparing a 328i to an older A4 1.9 TDI is a fair comparison. I'm driving a 2013 328ix loaner today with 1,400 miles on the odometer. Great car, but I have to say that the 335d would be my strong preference for both performance and fuel economy over a 328i. Had to shut off the engine start stop feature to maintain my sanity in stop and go traffic. There is no diesel clatter in my friend's 2011 335d and it definitely has more punch when you need to accelerate on the highway. He gets an honest 40 mpg on highway cruising at 75 mph and 30 mpg overall. The trip computer on the 328ix loaner shows 23.3 mpg overall; probably heavy city driving. That said, the current 8,400 rpm NA V8 M3 with a 6-speed manual is about as sweet as a 3 series gasoline engine can get. I'd be the first to admit that if a really sporty, engaging drive is what you want, hard to beat a naturally aspirated high rpm manual transmission car like the M3. "
"flightnurse","January 2013"," Dino of course some of the engine in Europe aren't as refined as others. To pass judgement on the car you drove in europe with one that are imported here is like saying, there isn't much difference in a M6 and a Yaris...Drive a Passt or Jetta diesel you will be quite surprised on how well they run and really how quite it is for a diesel. "
"flightnurse","January 2013"," Ivan, I'm not too sure about this, if it is true please post a link so I can read it. Because I'm sure Infiniti and Lexus would be linked to Nissan and Toyota. Since Infiniti, Lexus and Porsche are imported as their own brand, one would assume that they are separate brands. "
"dino001","January 2013"," It would not be fair, pricewise, compare 328i to 335d. To me valid choice would be 335i vs. 335d - that would be no contest, IMHO. I understand all the limitations of comparisons between new BMW and old Audi. However, to be fair i terms of pricing, four cylinder diesel is one to make real comaprisons to the lower-powered gasoline engines, whether smaller 6-cyl, or turbo four. My point is, US based consumers THINK they want diesel because they see them in Europe and assume that's what Old World people want. All I'm saying, popularity of diesel there is artificially stimulated by public policy, taxation and other incentives. Anybody, who enjoyed American-market based ELLPS, would never even consider a diesel, except perhaps commercial vehicles, like taxi cabs and such. Moreover, the traditional advantages of diesels are going away. Bottom line - still clacking engine, less so than before, but more upfront cost, more maintenance, more prone to failures, sensitive to fuel quality, who knows if will last as long as older generations.

"ivan_99","January 2013"," I thought all were based on the main company, e.g. GM, Toyota, Nissan...but it may not be that definitivePorsche would have needed to make the largest increase in mpg, however, the fact that VW absorbed the sports-car company means there&#146;s a good chance that Porsche&#146;s fuel economy will now simply be part of the conglomerate&#146;s overall average.""Good chance"" does not mean it is; not certain how it's determinedC&D article "
"scwmcan","January 2013"," Let's see aren't the new direct injection gas engines ( mostly) louder with a clattering on startup when cold, more sensitive to fuel quality( and carbonong up) and likely to be less long lived?

And yes they prefer the manual. I think there may have been something wrong with your family member's Audi, as that is not how I experience my diesel's power, and it is only a 40hp three cyl, but there is more than 1000 rpm of usually power, or perhaps it was just the corporate VW diesel was not really suited to a car the size and weight of the Audi, though I am sure the newer versions would be better ( they are no longer the top of the class for modern diesels, good but not the best).In any case what is wrong with having the choice of more diesel cars here, no one is going to force you to buy one if you don't want one, why can't those of us that do want one have that choice?

Town cars aren't the limo of choice these days, so it seems.Asking one of the Prius taxi drivers if he'd consider a diesel, his answer was swift and emphatic....NO!His reasoning was the hybrids and gasoline cars have the same longevity these days. Plus, the additional cost of buying diesel fuel offsets any additional MPG. Segueing back to ELLPS, our 335i and S4 both get 20-21 MPG+ in the city, and nearly 30 MPG highway. These are performance cars capable of 0-60 sub 5 sec times that will cruise all day at 130 MPH + in quiet and comfort. Manufacturers have tried to get diesels to be more appealing in the U.S. I know a small, but vocal segment like them. They won't be successful here, however. "
"flightnurse","January 2013"," Graphic I was going to head to Vegas for a quick turn around and spend sometime at the CES (use to go for work between 86-96.) The problem I see, is that a premium is paid for the oil burner engine, then the price of fuel is more too. Just as the cabbie stated, however, with the new CAFE requirements coming into play, 30 MPG wont cut for the car manufactures. In regards to hybrids, is there a hybrid sold in the US that does not have a CVT? "
"habitat1","January 2013","  I think unfortunately your ""dino"" forum name perhaps belies a few dinosaur like biases towards diesels? The difference in price between a 2011 335d and the 2013 328i is a fraction of the difference between a 328i and a old VW 1.9 TDI. The 2013 328ix I had as a loaner had a sticker price of just under $51,000. As far as ""anybody who enjoyed American-market based ELLPS would never even consider a diesel""? Are you talking about the 95% of American ELLPS buyers that end up in a slush box automatic with a non-sport suspension? Or the 5% that really want and buy a sport sedan? Because if it's the latter, unless you are in a 335is with a real 6-speed manual and sport suspension, you aren't giving up much of anything in the 335d. Its competitive 0-60, MORE than competitive 30-80, can be equipped with a sport package suspension, etc. I think I could spec out a 335d that would put it ahead of 90% of the so called American market ELLPS's on the ""S"" front. And the fact that it would get 30 mpg overall and near 40 mpg on the highway would be a bonus.Fact is, the 3 series has become a little less ""S"" with it's weight gains, size gains, and lower revving turbo engines. Great cars, no doubt, but the real ""S"" customers are probably heading towards a 135iM on one end, M3 on the other. So, given that, I see the 335d - and even more so the new breed of M diesels, including the M550d - being extremely competitive with their gas counterparts for the average American buyer. Especially those that consider themselves ""S"" oriented, but come up with various reasons for not getting a stick. As for more maintenance and reliability, that is the big advantage of diesels. We have plenty of 300TD's and SDL's in our area that are still chugging along just fine at 200-300k+ miles. Their counterparts - old 525i's have been recycled into paperweights long ago. I just put a deposit on a 2014 Cayman S last night. So obviously I'm not in disagreement with the fact that a high revving, naturally aspirated gas engine mated to a real manual transmission is the choice of preference for a sports car. But that's not what most 3.600+ lb ELLPS buyers are looking for, and I think current and future diesel technology will make more and more sense for the ELLPS application. "
"dino001","January 2013"," 1000 rpm was an exagerration, but I basically stand by my comments, also because I know more diesel owners than most Americans - not just my dad, but also number of friends and relatives. Pretty much all of them said the same thing - they all would buy an 8- or 6-cylinder gas cars, if not for the fuel costs. They DO NOT love their diesels same way I loved my WRX, STI, or E9x 328, or some other people love their Camaros, Mustangs, Corvettes, or even Acuras or Lexus. They buy those diesel cars, because governments in Europe made it impossible (cost prohibitive) to own vehicle like those listed above - not just by fuel taxes, but by excise taxes, registration fees, etc., all tied to engine displacement with sharp increases for everything above 2 liters. In that world diesel beats gasoline, delivering more torque and better fuel economy, indeed, mostly because gas engine fights with one hand tied behind the back. In the past, diesel fuel was also 20% less expensive than gas, not the case anymore, but it helped establish present dominance of the diesels there. However, the math is working less and less and there is a slight reversal in preferences. Those things take time, though. Anyway, call me a fossil. I'm not saying I'd never get a diesel, but as long as I can afford it, as long US government doesn't do same market rigging, as European, I take gasoline engine. "
"dino001","January 2013"," We have plenty of 300TD's and SDL's in our area that are still chugging along just fine at 200-300k+ miles. You missed my point, exactly. Those 300 TD are old style diesels, true million milers, indestructible machines that would run on vegetable oil. They were also noisy, slow, awkward. The new E350 Bluetec is nothing of that. Yes, it is quiter, fast, nice, but its durability is not million miles, by a long shot. The old magic of ""running forever"" is gone. Even commercial vehicle drivers (bus, truck and such) confirm that the new machines are nowhere near in terms of durability in comparison to the old ones. "
"buya","January 2013"," Your sentiments are understood. I would too pick naturally aspired strong engine cars over cars boosted with turbo/dual turbo, diesel engine and combined engines. EV is in its infancy and it wouldn't even be considered. Fact is, the car industry doing business in the States does have to follow mpg stipulations set by our gov't, and the diesel engine seems most promising in helping them adhere to the scheduled guidelines. The gov't is not acting to help drivers save money. If enough people drive diesel, the fuel will be widely available and being a byproduct or not it will cost a lot too at the pumps. Americans like muscle cars, and if diesel cars dominate the market without offering desirable zoom power, people may scream for the return of muscle cars. Curious which current diesel or turbo diesel car you think is the best? "
"dino001","January 2013"," Curious which current diesel or turbo diesel car you think is the best?There isn't much to choose from, at the moment. Traditionally MB and VAG have good diesel motors, I'm sure BMW can hold its own, too. They're all in different market segments. Can't say I have any real opinion, what is better. I was susprised to hear that PSA (Peugeot/Citroen) was considered one of best in its class. Honda and Subaru have late diesel entries in JDM and Europe, heard good things about those (it would be really interesting to hear how diesel boxer sounds). All majors (GM, Ford, Toyota, Nissan) have diesels in other markets, but bringing them here is not so simple, due to diferent environmental rules. "
"flightnurse","January 2013"," The new E350 Bluetec is nothing of that. Yes, it is quiter, fast, nice, but its durability is not million miles, by a long shot. The old magic of ""running forever"" is gone.Do you have the data to back up that statement? "
"sweendogy","January 2013"," I think I would worry about the electronic gremlins in the dash more then the engine with standard maintience. "
"dino001","January 2013"," I should have been less definitive in my post. It was an opinion, not a statement of fact, based on general MB (lack) of reliability record in last 10+ years, myriad of statements from automotive press, some anectotal report from commercial drivers of ""new diesels"". In other words, I should have written something like ""many people, including me, do not expect those engines last anywhere close to those 300 TDs, even when properly maintained - which in itself is more expensive and a chore"". There is also matter of complexity, the more complex those motors are, the more things can go wrong. Yes, it is an opinion. Btw, the last item applies pretty much to all engines. It will be much harder to run those new 250 hp gasoline turbos to 200k miles, too, not without expensive electronic overhauls, which nobody will be willing to pay for (you put in several thousands and you still get old car). I'm not even so sure about basic mechanical parts, like pistons, or shafts, either - in current drive to remove mass, optimize performance, redundancies are being removed, which in turn must cut into durability. Again, just an opinion, but based on some general engineering priciples I use at work in another field (structures). "
"nyccarguy","January 2013"," I agree with you dino001. Manufacturers that offer diesels don't work for me. I'd welcome the extended range & consider the price differential as an engine upgrade.VW offers cheap diesels, but frankly long term durability scares me. BMW's twin turbo Diesel I6 is a gem. I'm not in the market for a $65K X5d. Even CPO, they are pricey. The E90 335d is only offered in RWD.I'm not in the market for a $55K Bluetec E350 or ML 350 either. "
"scwmcan","January 2013"," You still haven't said why it is a bad thing for the diesels to even be offered here, get that you prefer a gas engine, and I respect your opinion and would never want you to not be able to buy one ( the Government may have different ideas, but that applies to the diesels as well), why shouldn't people who want to buy a diesel car have a chance to do so? Are you afraid that your preferred gas engined cars will disappear? ( not likely any time in the near future, as you said they are still improving them, and even in Europe they still make up half the market). In any case you are entitled to your opinion, and no one here would want you to be forced to buy a diesel, hopefully both engine types can finally be available here, and diesels can begin to build a bit of market share, but if they turn out to be as bad as you think ( hint they won't, but I do agree they may not last any longer than a gas engine now, who knows for sure, but they likely won't be any worse either). Hopefully you can see that some people are interested in getting diesel in their cars and are excited by the possibility of getting one that is not a VW. "
"m6user","January 2013"," In regards to hybrids, is there a hybrid sold in the US that does not have a CVT? Yes, the Hyundai Sonata and Kia Optima hybrid models both use the same reg auto transmission as their non-hybrid versions. "
"dino001","January 2013"," Oh no, you must have misunderstood my intent. I am never against choices, so if somebody makes it and somebody else wants it, I have no problem. Not for me, but sure, if there is market why not. I find my own preferences in minority all too often to ever even hint of prohibition of anything. I only contested claims that just because European market has a lot of diesel powered small cars, they must be great or even better than gas engines for non-commercial passenger cars. I basically think diesels would not be nearly as popular there, if not for government interference and heavy regulatory hand and steep disincentives for large displacement engines. In my opinion, American market, prior current administration's overzealous initiatives was closest to ""natural"", with some limitations of course. I would risk saying that majority of Europeans would take American sixes and eights without blinking. They'd keep interiors and suspensions of their current cars, but they would be more than happy to switch those 1.6 cdi, or whatever, to 3.5 V6, if the government only ""let"" the them. I don't mean those are prohibited, but they are prohibitively expensive due to government. The said part is, current Administration wants to do the same. "
"dino001","January 2013"," I also believe Honda CRZ can even be had with manual. But that is so-called soft hybrid. "
"scwmcan","January 2013"," Okay Dino maks more sense now.I don't think the American market was closest to natural as diesels have not been offered here due to overegulation, I do agree that the playing field was/ is uneven in Europe though, I would guess the percentages for diesel in the fleet would be somewhere around 15-20% or maybe a bit higher if everything was even in terms of fuel taxes etc, I think people are used to gas engines and how they run, that said the torque low down and the low revs of the engine will appeal to a lot of people as well, the fuel economy is still better ( though the gap has closed). In any case as more non VW mainstream diesel's get here we will see if there is a market for them or not, right now we can only guess, I know I like my small diesel, though I wouldn't mind getting something a little larger ( the size of a Mazda 3 or so) with a diesel and probably getting close to the milage I am getting with my smart diesel. I did grow up with European cars so am used ota smaller engine than most Americans/Canadians, so accept a smaller more efficient engine better than some. In any case each to his own, I am just happy to see some diesels coming here, and looking forward to seeing how they sell and how they are rated for fuel economy etc. "
"dino001","January 2013"," I agree there may be a anti-diesel bias in emission regularions here, so it is fair to say there would have been more of them in smaller vehicles, if not for it. Considering Europe has 50% penetration through heavy regulation, US has nearly zero, also due to bias, 10-20% ""natural"" penetration makes sense to me, if regs were left neutral. There are legitimate uses for diesel in smaller vehicles, mostly in high mileage highway application, a bit less in city, but still. Cabs, minivans, some SUVs, especially those used hauling boats, or outdoors/off-road. Anything that hints severe operaton, heavy duty, long running times. Diesels last longest when kept warm, virtually on at all time, running at constant speeds. "
"flightnurse","January 2013"," I know this is the ELLPS forum, however, the topic goes all over the place, so here is the official introduction of the 2014 C7 Vette. 450hp 450lbs of torque, not too bad.http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2014-chevrolet-c7-corvette-stingray-z51-photos-- and-info-news?src=spr_FBPAGE&spr_id=1458_6594116 "
"habitat1","January 2013"," Again, just an opinion, but based on some general engineering priciples I use at work in another field (structures).I respect your general comments, but I think you need to take blind opinion-ism and replace it with a little more objective research and analysis. For example: According to NADA, the retail resale value of a 2008 Mercedes E320 CDI with 75,000 miles is $26,065. The resale value of the same E350 is $22,925. The E550, $27,750. If you increase the mileage to 120,000, the CDI begins to approach the E550 resale and is well ahead of the E350.There is no doubt in my mind, based upon everything from objective resale values, to experience of friends and colleagues, to what I have heard and read from both mechanics and mechanical engineers, that the current Mercedes Bluetec and BMW diesels are MORE durable and less likely to require major repairs than their gasoline counterparts, especially in high mileage use. You are entitled to form your opinions on whatever biases you may have, but I think a bit of actual research may prove them to be incorrect. "
"sweendogy","January 2013"," While others post albeit interesting posts on porshe and gms corvette - a few ellps have been announced today. Yep the new Infiniti, MB and Lexus. Just want to make sure we are all in the same chat here. "
"nyccarguy","January 2013"," Thanks for keeping us on track sweendogy;)I saw a pic of a ""320i"" on BMW's Facebook page. Anybody know what the specs are on that? "

"nyccarguy","January 2013"," So have the likes of Dinan & Turner Motorsports started extracting more power from BMW's 2.0 L Turbo 4? Maybe this 320i will be the decontented model enthusiasts want. If the 328i can be chipped, then I'm sure a 320i can as well. "
"flightnurse","January 2013"," Dinan works hand in hand with BMW, I would assume as soon as the car hits the shores one will go to them.So here is a link for the new Infiniti Q50 has lots of techie stuff, so far they only talk about the V6 and Hybrid...http://www.infinitiusa.com/all-new-q50/?next=Home_Page.PFA.Button.Q50_Micro "

Again, with the advancements in gasoline power, and hybrid technology (as well as electric cars) I don't think diesels will be anything but a niche, at best, here.I think this is slowly changing, VW sells every single diesel they import, same for Audi and MB. With the new wave of diesel coming in more mainstream cars this is what it might take to change people thoughts. "
"sweendogy","January 2013"," Agree with flight- had a buddy in mass who had to go to Detroit to get a golf vw- couldn't find one on the east coast. "
"scwmcan","January 2013"," I agree at the moment it is the self fullfilling prophesy, Americans won't buy diesels ( hatchbacks, wagons, manuals etc) so we won't bring them here, thus nobody buys them because they aren't available, meaning that no one else brings them. I think there is a market for diesel's ( and the rest) if only they will bring them, VW and the rest of the Germans seem to be doing okay with them, we will see what happens with the other diesels that are said to be coming, if the sell more will follow. Like I said in an earlier post I think you could get up to 25% of the market being diesel, another 25% or so hybrid, maybe 40% gas, and 10% other in the near future, with the other percentage growing in the long term, with gas engines being the loosing group, diesel may get higher if they can get an economical bio diesel out, Natural gas may get some ( but I think it is better used for ther things, the market may disagree) electric will get some and will increase as range increases and charging stations appear along at least the highways, hydrogen may come if they can figure out how to produce it cheaply enough, and using less energy to get it than it gives, and who knows what else could happen, or the worst could happen and there won't be any personal transportation for normal people. "
"sweendogy","January 2013"," I would choose cold fusion or the flux capacitor. In a cheap Eco car diesels or hybrids work if they can bot for similar dollars and save mucho dollars in gas. That's why they work in Europe - things change- look at ford selling all those V6 full size pick up trucks . "
"flightnurse","January 2013"," So again, why does VW, Audi and MB sell every single diesel they import? Now granted we are talking 50-60K units a year.. What is interesting though, VW.Audi and MB do not do a real mega advertising blitz on them either and they sell every single one. "
"flightnurse","January 2013"," According to my BMW dealership you can order a 320i starting in Feb with a March del date. You can build one on BMW website, I believe they have done it right, both Auto and Manuel are no charge, Limited colors and interior, limited options, one can be had for under 40K that is almost fully loaded. Would be interesting to see what Dinan can do with the engine, 180hp is OK, but 240 is even nicer...Now in regards to the wagon, my dealer tells me that the wagon will not be imported, however, it is on BMW USA website. I'll find out myself Sat when I'm at the Detroit Auto Show. I'm in the planning stage of going to the NY Auto show, and one in the NY area planning on going? would be nice to go through it with other car enthusiast... "
"dino001","January 2013"," I would believe the website, not the dealer on the wagon. It is clearly in ""Future Vehicles"" tab, not ""concepts"". I think there will also be 3-series GT coming to the US, as well. I love my wagon so much, I'd not get the new one, but if they sell 335i GT with manual, that's the one I could consider buying instead of my wagon. I think 335i is likely, just as 5-series GT is only sold in higher output engine versions (535 and 550). Manual - that may or may not come. If they keep it in line with rest of 335 offerings, it should be available, but no saying for sure.320i - that's news to me. I got to check it out. Not that I'd buy, but it is curious. It basically means they think the market is ready for low-powered BMW. "
"dino001","January 2013"," Wow, the pricing on F30 is simply outrageous. I optioned 320i to ""dino's minimum"": red (metallic), sports and premium package and split fold down back seats (must - THEY ARE STILL $500 OPTION :mad: :mad:  ) and you fly by 40 grand on the sticker (around $41K). No sunroof yet (another grand). Add that, Navigation, xenons, anti theft, BMW Assist to roughly match my E90 wagon you get over $45K on the sticker, just about thousand less than my wagon's sticker (and that's ""new"" car, so don't expect big discounts). And that is for 50 hp less, four cylinder (rather than 6), no automatic headlight, no homelink, less metal, they want just about the same price.Granted, my wagon was last year of the platform, leather was ""free"", but still. Just amazing what some people think their product is worth. I'm pretty sure the market will verify some of that pricing wishful thinking. Can only imagine those lease deals. "

"dino001","January 2013"," The wagon will still be sold as 328i, I believe. I may be wrong about that, though. "
"dino001","January 2013"," I looked closer and it seems it's getting stranger by a minute. 320i uses 2 liter turbo with 180 hp @5000 rpm. 328i uses same 2 liter turbo with 240 hp @5000-6000 rpm. That's 70 hp from same displacement. The spec page shows torque of 184 lb-ft (320) vs. 255 lb-ft (328) as similar revolution range. Those are big differences. Acceleration 0-60 is 7.1 sec vs. 5.8 sec, but I bet it looks completely different for 50-80 mph, which is much better measure of driving experience (European magazines test this), basically showing passing ability and strength against wind resistance.So unless the gas mileage gain is trully significant, I see this trim failing miserably. I suspect they introduced it only to get better CAFE and to justify even more price hikes on 328 and 335. "
"robr2","January 2013"," 320i uses 2 liter turbo with 180 hp 5000 rpm. 328i uses same 2 liter turbo with 240 hp 5000-6000 rpmSame engine, different tuning.I suspect they introduced it only to get better CAFE and to justify even more price hikes on 328 and 335.I think they are introducing this trim in order to increase the selling/leasing price of the 328 and to increase unit sales for bragging rights.One can lease the 328i today at $369. Let's say the 320i leases at $349. Then it gives BMW the room to move the 328i to $399 a month while still offering the frugal buyers the 320i for $50 a month less. "
"dino001","January 2013"," I know, it is the tuning. But it seems to me, such move will be justifiable, if fuel economy gains are substantial. So far, they are ""TBD"". I'not a lease buyer (not that I'm against them, just never found one I liked, as wagons don't have same level of subsidy as sedans), so I can't comment if $50 per month is ther right level. Leases can be done at almost any payment level, what counts for me is the sticker and street price. Loaded 320i at 45 grand, almost as much as my E90 328 was, is jumping the shark. "
"robr2","January 2013"," Loaded 320i at 45 grand, almost as much as my E90 328 was, is jumping the shark.If you tick any boxes on any BMW, the prices become ridiculous. $50K + for a 335? Ridiculous IMHO. "
"nyccarguy","January 2013"," Tick a fair share of option boxes & a 335 quickly approaches the mid - upper $50K price tag. "
"sweendogy","January 2013"," Yeah it's official - it's jumped the shark- BMW 3 series no longer Ellps -hosts please remove it from the right hand column and add another acura.

I've been saying it for years bmw makes great drivers cars but they are not cheap- sure they might be the enthusiast choice but for 9/10ths you can save 20% and get a comp car with better technology and more hp. so are you really getting a better car ?

"nyccarguy","January 2013"," Buying out my E90 at the end of it's lease seem like a better & better idea;) "
"scwmcan","January 2013"," Partly it is lack of competition, and partly it is because they are some of the best cars in their classes for fuel economy, and I think I am responding even though your comments are probably for Dino. I am a diesel supporter and think the market has been suppressed, I think that if there were more offerings we would probably have around 20-25% of the market being diesel, therefor the current 2% is unrepresentative. "
"habitat1","January 2013"," sure they might be the enthusiast choice but for 9/10ths you can save 20% and get a comp car with better technology and more hp. so are you really getting a better car ?That's the ""better"" question that should really have a ""for you"" attatched to the end, since everyone has their own priorities and preferences. I could cancel my 2014 Cayman S order and get 40% more horsepower for $20k less in a new Corvette. Does that make it ""better""? Not for me. The Corvette design, albeit improved, still looks like it has to many legacy Pontiac designers trying to get their two cents into it. And I don't need to spend anything for a car that I don't like to look at.You are an Infiniti G guy - I would have liked to join your camp back in 2004, having had a great 150k experience with my 1995 Nissan Maxima SE. But I was disappointed in the lack of refinement in the Infiniti G35 sedan vs. the TL 6-speed. I had to make the tough compromise of going with a FWD car, but given that it was/has been a daily driver and we have a second home in the snow belt, I accepted the trade off. I certainly respect those that go the other way, and the G37S 6-speed is a damn nice car, but is still just a perplexing notch away from the engine and transmission refinement that I think Infiniti is capable of. Also, let's not forget that Japanese horses are a bit more of the Shetland style than Germany's Clydesdales. The former 335i (haven't driven the new one with a stick), was still the quickest ELLPS on the market, in spite of a 30+/- rated horsepower disadvantage to Infiniti. And as quick as the 450hp/450 ft.lb Corvette is likely to be, I still doubt it will significantly outrun the 911S in spite of a 50hp/125ft lb advantage on paper. "
"dino001","January 2013"," Sween, I'm afraid the competition will keep up (in terms of pricing). Everything is getting more expensive. Loaded Ford Focus is getting close to 30 grand on the sticker, same goes for many other compacts, loaded Accord crosses 30 grand in a snap, Lexus raised the sticker for its hatchback hybrid by three grand or so without clear increase in its content (don't know too much about this vehicle to say, but saw a headline), so why wouldn't BMW want to charge 40+ grand for its detuned entry level 3-series with couple of options? I bet Infinity will soon come up dreadful with G25 replacement, which will be opportunity to ""reset"" pricing for it and G37. Even Acura with its traditional value approach, made a move down, but mostly by rebadging and redressing Civic, which I would hardly call an attractive ELLPS. However, ILX is an opportunity to move prices on next TSX up (provided they will they keep the car, I sure hope so). Everything is getting more expensive. We all have to deal with it. Price limits set 10 years ago no longer apply. "

"flightnurse","January 2013"," Sween, I'm afraid the competition will keep up (in terms of pricing). Everything is getting more expensive. Loaded Ford Focus is getting close to 30 grand on the stickerBingo.... Mark my words, Dinan will have a reflash for the 320i, and it will keep the factory warranty. So a 320i for less then 40K and have the same performance as a 328i, is a good thing.The new Wagon, will be an excellent value, with the diesel engine. "
"habitat1","January 2013"," Flight, You conveniently avoided my previous post with an excerpt from Dinan's own website that forewarned that, essentially, there is no free lunch and ""reflashing"" will result in greater engine stress and wear. Go back to my previous post for the direct quote or read through their homepage. And Dinan's willingness to match BMW's 4/50 engine warranty is not much consolation when modern engines should easily last 150k+ miles. Hell, I could probably do fine over the next month or two having a 5 hour energy drink for breakfast, lunch and dinner. But I don't think that would be a wise long term solution to just eating right and getting exercise. I don't know the percentage of daily driving 3-series buyers that go to their local Dinan store for a pick me up to try to turn their 328's into 335's and their 335's into M3's. But my guess is the percentage can be counted using less than the fingers on one hand - and a thumb isn't a finger. I do know that the resale value of an everyday BMW that has had the ""reflash"" or other engine modifications is significantly reduced. And I suspect that it's not permitted in a lease. It certainly will never qualify for a BMW CPO warranty.So the idea of reflashing a 320 might be an option for you and a handful of your buddies, but that's really not comparing factory apples to factory apples for 96%+ of the market. Maybe 99%. "
"stickguy","January 2013"," I was checking out the website at the local BMW dealer recently. Some nice 2010s (maybe 11s also?) and the service loaners looked like a particularly good deal.I really want one. Someday. I guess 6 years from now when I might be able to buy myself another car, I may be able to afford a 2010!I had such a great plan. Get me wife the 2007 X3 I found for a good price, then get me a slightly used 328 for every day duty, and something cheaper for my daughter. Would have been the same price in total of what we ended up getting (3 cars), but I would not be stuck with the cheap old one!she just got hung up on having to have a brand new car. "
"andys120","January 2013"," Stickguy, I resisted the siren call of BMWs for most of my adult life because new ones always seem just a bit too expensive. I passed up on the 2002s, 320is and the wonderful E90s until one fine day I stopped in at a BMW reseller near my office and priced second-hand E39s.I ended up getting a 4 y/o 2000 328ia for about half the original MSRP. I've put 100,000 miles on it in the eight years since and it still looks and runs great. That strategy was so successful that I decided last winter to get a 2001 330Ci Cabrio to serve as my winter ride while I'm in Arizona for the cold months. This particular car had just under 80K on it and cost about what a new Focus would. It has given me no problems at all thus far.BMWs have a pretty steep depreciation curve. Why not take advantage of the fact that so many of them are leased (with strict limits on yearly mileage)and grab a lightly used one.Buying used is the best way to enjoy Bimmers IMO. "
"flightnurse","January 2013"," Simple you have the money to spread around multi dealership trying to decided what you want to buy, we all get that. There are people who can not, so that is why turner companies are out there and have done very well. Dinan works with BMW, anytime Dinan does any work, whether it is stage 1 suspension kit or supercharger kit, the VIN # is sent to BMW. The failure rate for Dinan engine work is very low, about the same as BMW themselves. So having an Dinan or just go to your local BMW dealer and buy a B7 from ALPINA. Turners today are the what they were 20 years ago, I would only work with turners who have a working relationship with the manufacture, i.e Dinan.So I understand you don't like tuners, that is fine, others do. There are many guys on Bimmerfest who would tell something else, I just love watching the videos they post of 335i's playing with 911S on the freeway and the 911 guys doesn't get it... A couple of guys have 90K on their 335i that are making 440hp RWHP they have been from day one of ownership (original owners.) havn't had any major engine problems. "

"habitat1","January 2013"," I didn't disagree that Dinan is one of the best, most reputable tuners around. And they can be a relatively good bang for the buck in performance. I simply restated what they stated on their website: asking more out of a smaller engine will besult in more engine wear. So my take is that somebody that is very performance minded, goes to the track on occasion or regularly and doesn't care about shaving some life off the second 100,000 miles on the engine, the Dinan option is a viable one. But for those that are counting on the car being a daily driver for 8-10 years and do not want to take the risk of Dian's admittedly increased engine wear, might think twice.I have a friend who took his 996 Turbo to over 600hp/650 ft lbs at the wheels through a Porsche approved tuner as well. The car has been timed at under 10 seconds in the quarter mile, putting him a few tenths and a couple million dollars ahead of a Bugatti Veyron, so yes, I understand the economics. I just still don't see you acknowledging the increased engine wear factor - whether or not that is of importance to you, it will be to many. "

They are not looking forward to the new M3, twin/triple/quadruple turbo 6, more power and better mpg notwithstanding. There is something about the visceral feel of an 8,400 rpm naturally aspirated V8 that they don't want to see lost. They view the M5 similarly.

The engines today that are build as turbos wont self-destruct like engines 20 years ago. There is always a risk when added more boost to an engine than what the manufacture had planned. This is why people need to reframe from increasing the boost too high, there is a fine line between power and reliability. "

I have had no major issues with the car. I have all the necessary services performed and the oil changed every 5k miles. Only downside to the Acura is that it run on premium fuel. Other than that, it is a very good car. This car is still quick and will outrun and outperform a lot of cars. Resale value is also very good on Acura's. "

It's a truck, and its truck engine is not to be slighted. We've got nearly 130K miles on it, and it's running strong. However, putting this engine in a ""sport sedan"" is questionable, IMNHO.My TSX is going to hit 70K very shortly -- has needed almost nothing and runs very well.Sometimes those old posts were made by people who still monitor Edmunds regularly -- not often, but it does happen.

"markcincinnati","January 2013"," Well I would agree that there are no test reports pertaining to the Q50 -- or if there are, I can't find them or don't have the time to look.But I thought the specs were revealed. I know that I printed out the current G dimensions (wheel base, overall length and width, etc.) Also somewhere there is a discussion of the two engines the thing will offer on day one -- including HP and torque.My admittedly fuzzy recollection: Q50, same wheelbase as G37; Q50, 2"" wider than G, Q50 about 2"" longer than Q. Same 7 speed transmission in the Q50 as was in the G37 -- and that is the only transmission offered. Same 3.7L engine in the Q50 as was/is in the G; the hybrid uses a 3.5L engine -- similar to the set up in the M37 and the M hybrid.Q50 can be had in both engine variants with AWD.Now, insofar as the full run down of specs (like can be found about the G37), I have not been able to find a source for these specs pertaining to the Q50.Overall, the new Q50 will be longer and wider and probably ""feel"" like a major size upgrade over the G37's. I assume the Q50 will be a slightly smaller, more agile, quicker version of the M37 -- or a slightly larger, more agile, quicker version of the G37.I am looking forward to driving one -- hopefully the sport package includes beefier springs, struts/shocks, anti-sway bars and brakes, in addition to sport seats and a steering wheel with paddle shifters.I see no big deal in the dropping of a manual transmission. The up take on manual transmission versions was probably less than 3 or 4% in any case. My assumption is Infiniti let the stick shifts go due to market apathy.I would expect a small price increase -- real, but not huge (not yet anyway.) "
"dino001","January 2013"," Q50 is bigger than G, 50 seems also quite a high number (by their own new naming strategy, it is about half way between 10 and 99). I'd bet there is a model below this one, (Q30?) coming (smaller size, engine would give them better fuel economy credits and some ability to capture market segment below current G). If so, Q50 may be priced much higher than you think. Everything is going up. If 320 can be priced at 45 grand (with options), who knows where this can go. "
"flightnurse","January 2013"," Dinio I would agree that the Q50 is going to be higher in price, and that a smaller car will be placed under the Q50. Something like 1 series or A3. Now in regards to pricing of the 320i, a fully loaded 320i is $46K, Nav is a stand- alone option on the car, I would guess that most people would go for a 320i with Premium package, and Nav, which is 40K. But you can get a 320i well equipped for under 40K, "
"flightnurse","January 2013"," According to Infiniti's web page, the drive-train of the Q50 is a carry over, so performance should be able the same, maybe a little faster or a little slower. Many people stated that the ATS was going to be a faster car because it made more HP in both turbo and V6 models, however, all the mag's have shown that the BMW turbo 4 and turbo 6 are faster. The Germans know how to put a car together, they feel that all parts work together, this is the problem with other cars makers, maybe with the exception of the Italian high end cars. I hope the Q50 is a great car, competition is good for everybody and only makes things better in the long run. Yes, prices are going up and ALL cars. It will be interesting to see what the top of line Q50 will go for with all the technology they plan for it. "
"markcincinnati","January 2013"," Priced MUCH HIGHER? I would think if, to use made up but approximate numbers, that an Audi A4 or BMW 3 (something) can be ""nicely contented,"" which I suspect means, these days, Premium Package, Premium Paint (and Infiniti doesn't, currently, charge for any color they offer), Nav Package, and Sport Package or Technology Package (but not both) for something between $45K and $49K -- depending on the ""either or"" packages and metallic paint, bla bla bla, that Infiniti would be -- even with this new presumably sexy Q50 -- hard pressed to come in at parity with the Germans.I mean, really, my last A4 (a 2009) was $49K -- for $49K I'm going to stick with the German car. I wouldn't pay $49K for the G (or the new Q -- at least not until it is vetted by you all here on Edmunds and the motoring press, etc.)I would think the Q50 will have to be very nicely equipped (meaning all the bells and whistles Infiniti can offer -- but not the hybrid version) and a few grand less to win, to conquer the pro German buyers.I leased my current Acura TL SH-AWD Advance ONLY because it was much less than a 2012 A4 comparably equipped and a hell of a lot less than an S4 which the TL somewhat ""imitiates.""I'll scope out a new A4, BMW and probably C class. Then I will do my best ""objective"" comparison with and without a consideration of price.If the Q50 turns out to be BMW-like and is hundreds less per month in payments or thousands less in MSRP (and/or street price) and is either contented at or greater than the BMW, I'll very probably give the Q50 serious consideration. If the Q50 is close to the ""cost"" of the German rivals -- with even somewhat close content, the German is with very high certainty going to be the chosen one.I could be wrong -- but, not uncertain, of course -- and perhaps the new ex-Audi alum, Infiniti CEO will want to pump up the Q50's MSRP to achieve parity with the German ""B"" segment from the get-go.My logic, hopefully not specious, is that the Infiniti Q50 no matter how much it is called the Japanese BMW will not be able to command BMW prices until such time -- if ever -- that people start calling the BMW, ""the German Infiniti."" :surprise: DOH!Homer "
"dino001","January 2013"," I'm still struggling to get over those new prices. I mentioned that already, but 320i sedan, if comparably equipped, would be priced HIGHER than my E91 328 wagon, with couple of (small) things even missing. Basically, 60 hp or so less, less metal, cheaper interior, pay the same. I dread the day pricing of new 328i wagon will be released (I assume it will be 328, not 320). I suspect it will start in low 40s shooting to something like 55 grand after putting same equipment, as my current one.  "
"sweendogy","January 2013"," According to other sources they will expand the offering to include some Mb parts- as noted here...http://www.worldcarfans.com/113012953195/infiniti-q50-to-get-turbo-4-cyli- nder-and-a-dieselSo does that make them half German.This was mentioned in some of my past posts ( you can search) that they have a platform agreement to share.""Many people stated"" ok that's a switch from the last post- but if you did a search it's a select few - ""Interesting to see what top q50 will go for"" I could bet its going to be less then current 335, and prob closer if to ""top"" BMW 328 will go for and offer more( in tech for sure).

"graphicguy","January 2013"," mark....I think a point can be made that at least the 328i and the 335i motors are WAY underated as far as power is concerned.As you made mention of, getting a G (or now Q50) or an Acura TL to butt heads at the $50K mark puts them among the best of the segment (namely, the BMW, MB and the Audi). They don't want that fight if I had to guess.Speculation, but sounds like the Q50 will be larger, with the same power trains. So, performance with today's G would be similar.I'll reserve judgement on looks until it shows up in the flesh. But, if it comes in anywhere north of $45K, it's going to cannabalize the M, which is close to that number discounted. Following the train of thought that the Q50 will be a slightly smaller M (will it become the M50 with the same 3.7L?), and given how slow the M is selling, anyone care to make a deduction on the new Q's sales numbers?BTW, the local Infiniti dealer is advertising cars (relatively) cheap right now. $7K off a G37x. $5,500 off a G25. $6K off an M. A little ngetiation and probably beat those prices by a few hundred more. "
"flightnurse","January 2013"," Dino it is all relative, when I bought my 330i and the price I paid compared to what a new 335i is. But as we all know prices goes up and not down. So the new 3 series wagon is bigger then your's and the biggest complaint with the E90 was rear passenger room, and the 2013 wagon will have more room. I'm hoping that the wagon will come in RWD and AWD, I haven't gotten any conformation on it, which is odd, as I'm sure the final product has been approved. "
"flightnurse","January 2013"," Graphic here in Phoenix the infiniti dealers have been taking $4500 off most G37s, maybe this is how they are selling so much, lets just discount them to a point that it makes sense to lease one over a BMW or Audi. "
"dino001","January 2013"," So yes, it is relative. You expect prices to go up. But one expects also quality to at least remain, if not improve. I do not see this in new 3-series. Well, replacing 330 with 335 few years back at similar price was a great deal, as 335 is much stronger than 330 and gas mileage was maintained if not improved. But the new 320 is going to be priced about same as previous 328 - and that is not a good deal. Especially because:- the steering feedback on new 3-series is a step in WRONG direction- quality of materials on new 3-series is clearly result of cost-cutting spree (chep ""hard"" switches, cheap ""ratchet-like"" feeling iDrive, cheap ""hard"" door latch from 80s).- 50 horses was sent to pastures (180 vs 230), but you pay just about the same; you will gain miles per gallon, which some people will appreciate, but I find my E91 at 23-25 mpg on the daily commute satisfactory (not mindblowing, but decent). I would consider 320 a good deal, but at price point about 5 grand below. And the got to fix the steering, the interior feel and the damn door latch. "

About 2 years ago looked at the M37 with interior and options great, but transmission did not shift well. Test drove the QX56 great pickup and great vehicle. Based on infiniti's trend the inside of the Q50 showed be very appealing. My concern is how it will drive as I am concerned about the transmission, only a test drive will answer that question.

Ja Wohl) whereas the Japanese only offer 'bundled' options (Tech Package, etc.). "
"sweendogy","February 2013"," Totally agree- the basic options (leather, Lights, heated seats) are standard on the Japanese brands. "
"nyccarguy","February 2013"," I agree with you that there is nothing wrong with ""normal"" cruise control. I just stated that because MB touted Distronic in their ad.I also agree with you about a good windshield mounted GPS. My BMW's fully integrated navigation is nice to have, but if I were to look for another E90 328xi, I could live without it.Where I live in CT, the back roads and even the Merritt Parkwayare not well lit. I love my car's Bi-Xenon Adaptive headlights.AWD isn't a requirement (especially since the CLA is a FWD car). I like having it, even if it gives me a ""false"" sense of security. If I were to buy a FWD or RWD car, I'd have to buy snow tires for it. If I were to buy a dedicated set of snow tires and winter wheels, that'd be basically not too muich less than the cost of what the manufacturer charges for an AWD system.As far as looks go, to me there is no single determining factor that impact whether I like the way a car looks other than the wheels (rear end is second). I really like the way my 17"" split 5 spoke (value package) wheels look on my car. The Sport Pkg Wheels & the ///M SPort Pkg Wheels look fantastic on the E90s as well. Some of the ""base"" 16"" wheels on the lower optioned 328i E90s make the car look down right cheap. I would never buy a car with wheels I don't like and say to myself: ""I'll get a set of sport package or ///M Sport package wheels in the spring."" I'm sure the car (as most are) is ""best in it's base configuration."" Like others have said, how many of these base or low optioned cars are going to be at the auto shows, in press fleets, on dealer showrooms?Look at something like a Wrangler Unlimited. In it's base form (Sport), it is perfectly capable and will handle a lot of snow and even some light to medium duty off roading. How many Wrangler Sports do you see driving around? Where I live, I see a lot more Saharas (High $30K Sticker) and Rubicons (Low $40K Sticker). "
"dino001","February 2013"," ... is fold-down rear seat. I think for BMW or Benz to demand $500 for it on sedans is a true scandal and I'm shocked they are getting away with it. What's worse, many dealers actually do not order this option, so I can bet there are many trully surprised owners of 3-series, who discover their seats don't fold down first time they try to put something bigger into their trunk.Xenons? Yeah, I think this is a disapointment that Germans charge extra for those. It should be standard today on ELLPS.Leather seats? I'd agree that in US-market it is also a big disapointment that BMW or Benz demand almost two grand for that, but knowing a bit about Euro market, I can certify that Europeans at large do not revere leather uphostery nearly as much as Americans. Many straight out prefer high quality cloth over leather on both their home couch and their car. One could call it charitably a ""cultural difference"". MB Tex is reporteadly a very high quality material, both in terms of appearance and durability, so it is even preferred by many. Quick inventory browse shows it is a majority on C250 models, which seems to confirm that assertion. If they sell, they can't be so bad. I bet many people actually think it is leather (as it is faking it really well).I don't know about BMW, their leatherette has much less footprint. It may mean the quality differential is greater. However, BMW also bundles leather with its premium package (MB does not), which is considered a must, even by selling dealers (BMW dealers actually order the cars they want within model allotments), plus it was even a free upgrade when E9x was being phased out (I know it was $0 option on my 2012 wagon).Anyway, I remember, when I added sunroof and those fold-down seats to sedan, suddenly the wagon (where it was standard) was not more expensive, at all. Tells me a lot about the mindset and market. I guess it is their effort to expand the buyer's base to those ""aspirational"" purchasers (not just by leases, but also by playing with content level), whereas wagons, coupes and convertibles do not have to carry that burden.

"flightnurse","February 2013"," Yeah- try finding a base car on any dealer lot. Phoenix Motor has 25 C250's that are under 39K... Half are 37.9K and under.

"dino001","February 2013"," It is impossible that those 37K-39K Benzes have leather. According to MBUSA.com, to add leather seats ($1750), you have add premium package ($2500), which means even without metallic color ($720), you have to add $4250 to sticker, i.e. price HAS TO cross 40 grand to get leather. The MBTex looks like leather, but it is not. Many dealers are just terrible in car descriptions on their websites. All they give you is price, colors and list of standard equipment, which they call ""options"", probably to confuse you. Or perhaps they don't undertand meaning of word ""option"". Assuming some low level secretary inputs the data, it is possible, I suppose. BMW, MB and Volvo dealers are worst when it comes to description of their stock. At least those from my neck of the woods. Surprisingly, Cadillac dealers show exact descriptions of their stock, including package/option codes and everything. The lower you go in brand, the better it gets. All Ford, Toyota, GM, websites are great when it comes to accurate stock description. Go figure. "
"sweendogy","February 2013"," So msrps on Germans are misleading because you dk what exactly is in the said car. Interesting.

Btw if the new mb 1 series is Ellps then so is the ilx. Now I'm not an acura fan in its current state of bland but will say if they are Ellps ( and to me that's debatable) they have pricing and packaging down. "

"bunit23","February 2013"," I have this going one another forum and thought I would bring this to a more universal sight too. I will be purchasing a car in the near future and I am going for CPO. I really want an AWD, so the S4 is my first choice. I heard the Quattro is sick. The car will mostly be used for Road trips and Weekend driving. I have a older Nissan Maxima that is my daily driver. My main issue with the Audi is that most people state that it will be costly and frequent, in the future, and I plan on keeping the car for a long time. My 96 Maxima currently has 171k on it. I live in San Antonio Tx and it can get pretty hot. Are there any reasons I should avoid the Audi besides costly repairs??? I am not a wrencher, but I am not afraid to dig in. I am open to other cars too Please give me suggestions!!! So far the cars that caught my eyes are: Infiniti G37x (looks cheap in most areas, but still a great ride) Lexus GS350 (Never owned a Toyota and this one seems pretty nice) Audi B8 S4 (so far has all the specs I want and I like to have cars I don't see on the road all the time) ***BMW 335xi is not on my radar because I see way too many BMW's out here.

"dino001","February 2013"," I don't know. All I saw on the website, if you took least expensive C250 starting at $35350, but not really because there is non-optional $905 manufacturer's ""transportation charge"", i.e. it REALLY starts at $36,255 MSRP (that is case of deceptive advertising, but it's a different story). Then any time you wanted to add leather, it required also a premium package, which in turn moved the price to 40+ grand. Your quoted car seems C250 Sport Sedan ($36,580) with standard 5-twin spoke wheels (for that line) and $475 worth of options, which ain't much - perhaps it is some snap-on navigation they mention. I do not think it is an internet There can be small discrepancies, as car prices change over the year. Definitely no leather - MB Tex (high quality polymer) is standard seat surface. No, this car does not have $2500 ""sports package"", it is C250 Sports Sedan. There is a difference, but the dealer probably doesn't know it (or pretends not to know it).Edit: Adding Sports Package to a red C250 Sports Sedan jacks the price to 41 grand (you have to add premium 1 with it, too, total bundle $4800). I doubt dealer would advertise such car for 37 grand. Considering the wheels, it is simple case of misinformation/misdirection. "
"dino001","February 2013"," S4 is best choice for fun, but in spite of being CPO, I would keep some good money on the account. If you have the money go for it. If you look for some low payment type of deal, or are not prepared to spend more on the car than just buying price, go for Infiniti. "

I sold it earlier than I normally do as I was worried about more costs/problems. But it was never unreliable or left me stranded.I now have an Acura TL with 130K and pretty near nothing has gone wrong. It's more reliable and cheaper to own than the Audi, and a very nice car. Costs aside, I'd pick the Audi. Just be prepared for some extra $$, which you might not need, but you never know. If you are concerned, you might be able to buy an extended warranty. "

"graphicguy","February 2013"," tlong.....you and I have the same taste in cars.....TLs, Audis, BMWs.Before the GF bought her S4, she did her due diligence. Personally, if I like a car, I'm all over it. But, I don't give much thought to reliability. And, quite frankly, I don't put much stock in Consumer Reports reliability rankings, as I consider them little more than the CR faithful (who they base the reliability rankings on) as confirming foregone conclusions. That's a different topic, though.The GF talked to everyone she knew who currently owned, or at some time owned an Audi in the past, about their ownership experience. While not scientific, and probably only numbered a dozen people, without fail, Audi ownership experiences were positive. pletko....well smack me silly and call me foolish. I like sport seats (that are heated). I like trick DSG transmissions. I like big fat leather steering wheels in my hands while driving. In other words, I'm one of those fools you describe. I'm good with that.Had this discussion with a friend while at a SuperBowl party last Sunday. He owns, among others, a BMW 6 series. Nice car. Not sure what the drivetrain is, but I think it's a V8 with a manumatic. I've ridden in it several times. I even drove it once (to take his inebriated butt home). It definitely is big and heavy, and you feel the mass and weight. It's not a particularly good handling machine, and it's not particularly quick. It's what I consider a poseur. That said, it's pretty and it costs a lot. Both of those traits fit my my friend's personality to a tee. :P We had the GF's S4 at the party. As we got into discussions about cars, he found the S4 not ""blingy"" enough for his taste. That alone made the S4's status move a couple of rungs up the status ladder for us.As we were talking, he asked me what I did not like about the TL. In all reality, I couldn't list one thing. There were some niggly things that maybe would bother me more than others (like a hint of torque steer on quick starts from stop). But, nothing that was a show stopper. Granted, the S4 and my 335 are faster and handle better. Plus, the suspension/ride/handling compromise in the Germans and 2nd to none.But, the TL SH AWD will get you to 80% of what the Audi will do. There are some things that the TL does that no other car I've ever owned was able to do. Now, these are minor things, but noticeable nonetheless.For example, I've never owned another car that had more comfortable sport seats than the TL. Nothing is perfect. But, for me, the TL's sport seats were about as close as you can get. They're bolstered perfectly and are comfortable while holding you in your seat. The HVAC system heats up and cools down faster than in any other car I've ever owned, too. And, it holds the perfect temp (that I've set) better than any other car I've owned.Ergonomically, at least for things like window switches, seat belt, steering wheel, etc., I could get in the TL, and with one smooth move reach and click the seat belt without reaching....all the while having my hand fall in the perfect location to the start button.Up until the B&O system in the S4 (which is insanely good), the TL's stereo was the best I had ever heard in a car (that includes some high buck aftermarket installations).Point of all this, even designs that are long in the tooth, like the TL, are still really good ELLPS these days. And, I certainly don't feel foolish for liking the options they come with. "

The price of $37,055 is really a base model with one thing added which is a aftermarket nav system, that integrates with the radio, just like the OEM nav system. It's a pretty slick system, so with the base price + shipping the car is $36,255, then add the nav system $800, this is how you get the $37,055 price. So it is possible to get a base C250, and the dealer I posted has many of them. "

"dino001","February 2013"," I'm an options fool, too. I don't buy those over the top stuff (like adaptive cruise control or lane departure thing) unless it is part of a discounted package. I am complete agnostic of wheels (never really understood why people care so much) and often would even prefer smaller rims, as they gove you more comfort, plus those really low profile tires look just stupid, IMHO. However, I want most items related to convenience, safety and sports suspension. I would not touch 3-series without their sports seat (their std. seats are terrible), I a fool for xenons and trully like the swiveling aspect of them. I'm a fool for a sunroof, fortunately it was standard on my wagon (and bigger, too). Parking sensors, keyless entry/start - yes please, especially that it was offered in one big package with two or three other things. Navigation - first I didn't want it, then they dropped the price by about $600 (they actually dropped the price of premium package, when it was combined with nav), so I took it. I like the screen, I like the routing, I despise the POI search (totally subpar in comparison to Garmin). Voice control came with it, doesn't work very well, especially in addresses (1 out of 5).I don't need all the appearance stuff, but I appreciate them. I opted out of M-package, but there are times I look back and second guess it. I saw a M-pack 328 wagon same color and year on a picture and it looked even better than mine.

"dino001","February 2013"," I had '03 WRX and later '08 STI. I live in Florida, similar to Tx. I loved them. The fun is on ramps, tight corners. The neutral feel in the middle of the turn and ""forgiving"" nature is unbeatable. The 03 WRX didn't have traction control, but I never needed it, even in big rain, even when tires got a bit worned out. It gave me plenty of warning and self correction just by easing on throttle. I have a RWD 328 now. I love it, too. It is different, but it is not as neutral, especially on corner entries. I love to hit the throttle half way through the turn, but it is classic ""slow in/fast out"" scheme. AWD gives you ability to come in too fast and still correct in the middle, keep the control and come out of the turn in decent terms. "
"flightnurse","February 2013"," You are correct and I'm sorry, it was Billperksii who wrote that no one would find a base car on the lot.. "
"flightnurse","February 2013"," I also assumed it was the ""internet"" price too which it wasn't it is a base care with an aftermarket Nav system that was designed for C230 and other MB for 2013. "
"dino001","February 2013"," Understood. If anything, I see the similar trend in stock of my local dealership. Vast majority of C250s they have there are low-option level between 37 and 40 grand MSRP. Moreover, there is very little stock of C300 or C350 lines. If you are an options fool (like I am), you would actually have a hard time to find C250 with the goodies. Very few cars with leather (MBTex seems to rule there), sports pack, some have premium pack, but unlike BMW, Benz charges for leather on top of premium pack.I woulnd't buy one anyway, but it is interesting to see what dealers think sells. It appears to me that BMW dealers tend to have better variety of options (from strippers to fully optioned), perhaps not at all times, but it is easier to find content level (and price) closer to anyone's preference (except for manual transmissions - those were non-existent in Tampa Bay last time I checked), which means they anticipate customers for every level of content, whereas Benz dealers seem to think people want the the star on the hood, but don't really care for the extras. But as I wrote in the past, there are some particular practices on both lots that are beyond me (like those fold-down seats on 3-series sedans, available as stand alone or part of cold weather pack and since Florida cars don't need cold pack, almost none of the ordered sedans get fold-down seats :mad: ). "
"dino001","February 2013"," No, I'm almost sure those are all MSRPs. The math and pictures seem to support it (standard wheels, standard seats, standard interior). You get to 37-39K levels when you take bare bones and add couple of small options (metallic paint, some accessories, etc.), or one package (like premium for 2500). "
"sweendogy","February 2013"," Talking about pricing and packaging - most chatter I've ever seen about this rig on these channels- no one is talking about what you really get with this 37k MB- a weak engine and sub group performance - I guess you do get the keys with the star on it - you get to walk into a dealership with 100k cars around. I still can't wrap my head around German premium car companies charging for leather on any car. "
"dino001","February 2013"," I feel your pain, brother They charge because they can. If they couldn't, they wouldn't. BMW had no charge for leather in last couple of years of E9x sedans and wagons - not because they were so nice, but because they couldn't charge and still get target sales. F30 came and extra charge for leather is back.  "
"graphicguy","February 2013"," dino....I always seem to look at Benzes when I'm in the market. That's about as far as I get given they really aren't all that sporty of a drive (until you get into the really high buck AMG versions). And, I try to understand the allure of them.Perhaps I'm only looking at the ""run of the mill"" MBs like the Cs and Es. I just can't make that leap. They aren't built any better than a comparable Audi or BMW. They certainly don't perform better than either of those. And, these days, not even the Japanese can claim tech or reliability superiority over Audi or BMW.For the same, usually less money, you can get something that's better, in most ways, from BMW or Audi.I'll have to assume that pushing the Mercedes marque down the ladder with the CLA is taking a page out of GM's marketing book. ""Hook them on a low priced Chevy (in Mercedes' case, a CLA), and move them up the model ladder"".That Mercedes Star, at that price point, is going to open up their market to perhaps one that they wouldn't necessarily want.Hope to see the CLA at the auto shows.

Why do you think that most dealership bring out that ""worksheet"" and ask you what you want to spend a month.Car segments are changing, and some cars in which YOU do not think fit in the traditional ELLPS, but they do. It will be interesting in the next 3-5 yrs what will be considered ELLPS. "
"graphicguy","February 2013"," FN.....I can't even remember the last time I drove a Camry....at least 2-3 generations ago. And, I've never driven an ILX. So, not sure if I can answer your question.Would I look at them? Sure! But, as most of us here are, I'm a car fanatic. I'm interested in all cars.Generally speaking, the customer for a Camry probably wouldn't consider any Mercedes for no other reason than they think maintenance and repairs are too costly and frequent. That perception can be debated. But, perception is reality in most people's minds.I know the 2 years I've owned my 335i, I haven't spent one nickel on maintenance due to BMW's 4 year ""no maintenance cost"" plan. The GF got a 4 year maintenance plan for the S4 where everything is covered. That was extra cost, and I can't remember what it was. When she asked me about it, it seemed reasonable at the time so it wasn't anything extraordinary.I've had the BMW in once for warranty work. The driver's leather seat had an area that was discoloring. They didn't re-dye it. They actually replaced the entire seat cover. Aside from oil changes and I think a software update they did for IDrive the last time I had the oil changed, that's been in.The GF's S4 has only had an oil change and tire rotation. That's it.Will a Camry be the same? They have a reputation as being trouble free. But, it sure seems like I read about a whole lot more recalls the last couple of years regarding Toyotas, than I hear from Benz, Audi, BMW or Acura. I don't pay much attention to Lexus or Infiniti. So, I don't know if an inordinate amount of recalls extend to those brands or not.I see the CLA's customer as being a young (20s) person not really looking for performance. But, one who's looking for an entre into the German marks and the alleged status they bring to the table (whether that status is real, or imagined).For a little bit more than a Camry, they can have a Mercedes, regardless of whether a CLA is or is not the better performing car. Something tells me you're going to see dealers back load those cars with the crazy wheels, spoilers, etc that make most of us cringe. But, that's the type of customer the CLA will appeal to. Dealers better get ready for a whole new type of tire kickers entering their showrooms once the CLA is released.Personally, I like the looks of the CLA. That might change when I see one in person. But, given that I put a higher priority on overall performance with my lux, I doubt I'll consider a CLA as something that would sit in my garage.I'm betting a Camry SE with a V6 will out handle and out accelerate a CLA. Yet, they won't be cross shopped by that same 20 something. "
"flightnurse","February 2013"," Graphic, I believe the CLA will get the AMG treatment, which will give it some performance. I agree that the CLA will bring a whole new type of customer to MB, just like GT-R brought a whole different buyer to the Nissan Dealer. Lots of changes happening and it will be interesting to see how the dealers will change. "
"stickguy","February 2013"," the real question though is if the CLA will be grounded to the ground. "
"graphicguy","February 2013"," the real question though is if the CLA will be grounded to the ground.Love it....made me grin, stickguy. FN...Be real interesting to see how the CLA dealers handle the onslaught of the ""hat backwards"" crowd.I saw one of the funniest sights I can reacall in quite some time. Saw an older Altima last night with what looked to be cheapo LCDs haphazardly strewn in the headlight casing. I let him get in front of me, and sure enough, he had LCDs in each headrest, playing some video, but no one was in the back seat to see it.That always makes me chuckle. "
"sweendogy","February 2013"," ""hat backwards crowd?"" - how they are handled by the dealers...throw in the Altima story and we have a red flag.I think they will do just fine ""accepting"" this crowd. Do all German cars some with a snob option or is that extra- like the premium paint? "

"m6user","February 2013"," Sorry, but just because a car has leather, some bells and whistles and MSRPs at the very low end of the ELLPS price range does not put it in a luxury category nor does it put it in a performance category. I don't believe anybody that buys a Fusion, Camry, Accord or Passat with a V6 and leather believe they are bying a luxury car just because the price overlaps the bottom of the ELLPS. They just know they are getting all the NAV, big sound, leather etc and realize if they wanted all that in a real luxury car they would be paying north of $40k, not north of $30k. + "
"flightnurse","February 2013"," So what is the ""official"" definition that _we_ must follow M6 of what is a ELLPS? Are you the grand Car Czar to tell us what models are and are not ELLPS? Or are the manufactures the one who do it? "
"m6user","February 2013"," No need to get your shorts in a twist. I absolutely am not saying I make the decisions. I kind of think the list at the top of this page does a decent job based on real data which I believe is based on consumer feedback and NOT on someones arbitrary opinion. I'm just saying that non-luxury makes don't pretend to be luxury so why should we put them in that category just because the top of line in their bread and butter cars cross slightly over into the absloute bottom of the ELLPS prices. Toyota makes the Lexus and calls it their luxury car and provides the warranty, service, dealership experience to go along with it. They don't market the Camry as luxury....they market it as value.If you can't tell a Camry from a luxury, performance sedan just by sight, feel and drive than you really should buy the Camry and save some money as you will not appreciate the difference.

"andys120","February 2013"," I saw my first Caddy ATS (outside of an Auto Show). IMO it's the best looking car they make. This one was Metallic Pearl White (a color that does not favor most cars). "
"sweendogy","February 2013"," Pretty cool from the pix I've seen I like as well with big wheels- also think (and seen) the largest caddy, forgot the name- is a looker as well.Flight I did not say its the quickest to 60, said I liked the looks - so you can correctly quote that. "
"flightnurse","February 2013"," Interesting I would place the Hyundai Genesis V8 is the category that you are saying. Hyundai is a Econ brand car company, however, owning one now for a while, I can tell you it is ever bit a luxury car. It's not a ELLPS, I would classify it as a ELLC (Entery Level Luxury Car.) It doesn't have the refinement of a E class however (but pretty darn close), the price difference is $25K too. Isn't perception part of this equation? Look at the first and second generation Lexus ES, just a over the top Camry, however, Lexus couldn't get them on the lots.... "
"andys120","February 2013"," also think (and seen) the largest caddy, forgot the name- is a looker as well. Interesting that you forgot the name (XTS) but symptomatic of the mess they have made at Cadillac (and Lincoln as well as others) of naming the variousmodels. Nomenclature should be the easy part but they can't seem to get it right and when they do, they mess it up (ala BMW). "
"carnaught","February 2013"," You are SO right about the car nomenclature. Everything in Lincoln is a ""Mark"" (MK), and all Caddy's are ""touring sedans"". I guess Continentals and DeVille's no longer have any cache :confuse: . "
"flightnurse","February 2013"," Continentals and DeVille's are synonyms with old people and both GM and Ford do not want anything to do with that. Lincoln was always the sporty of the FMCo luxury divisions. Now, many people could make an argument about this that both Continentals and DeVille's made sporty/stylist cars. However, it appears that both companies have decided to go down different roads.ATS, nice care, have been able to rent 2 of them, both with turbo's. Not as roomy inside as say a A4 or 3 series. XTS, nice car, it is large, rented it once, over all, better then the car it replaces however, the V6 is weak in the car of its'size. "
"carnaught","February 2013"," Continentals and DeVille's are synonyms with old people and both GM and Ford do not want anything to do with that.Agreed, but it would be nice if they could remake that image. The ""not your father's Oldsmobile"" and ""not your Uncle Olaf's Volvo"" isn't always successful  . "
"sweendogy","February 2013"," If I bought a new caddy , I would get an old school emblem from a deville or cineron - and slap that to the back, but i would not haphazardly do this - make it look good- would also consider a couple of headrest TVs. I miss car names as well. I think the Cts-v is a great start to get youth into the showrooms - 500 hp monster that still comes in stick. Lincoln on the other hand has a long way to go, besides changing the name of the company to bring youth into the showrooms . The new technology of its self driving car is pretty cool thou- "
"rayainsw","February 2013"," I wonder what will 'trickle down' to the next TL?http://www.edmunds.com/acura/rlx/2014/road-test.html- RayAcura used to be on my radar.... "
"markcincinnati","February 2013","  I read the test report, today in USATODAY on-line, of the new Acura RLX. The price came in at $61,000. The thing is, this was a front-wheel-drive version and it was noted that the AWD version wouldn't be here 'til fall and that the way the thing got to AWD would be by the addition of two electric motors one each driving a rear wheel. Comment was that this would add complexity and cost (and a heavy battery pack.)The car is probably every bit as nice to drive as Healy says it is, but for $61K you can get a very well equipped Audi A6 or BMW 5 (both of them AWD variants.) The Acura isn't ugly, it's just boring looking, too.What were they thinking?What will drift down to the new TLX (or whatever it is called)? Will the TL at least retain the availability of SH-AWD (I think only AWD TL's should be offered -- to really be in the ELLPS class)? To my eye a top o' the line Passat looks more ""premium"" than the RLX (and the current TL -- and I know, I have one.)What makes something belong to a certain class -- it seems the lines have become blurred somewhat. There is no way I would put this new RLX in the LPS class, despite a $61K MSRP (as tested.) I thought too that Lincoln was having a case of wishful thinking when they wouldn't allow their new baby to be tested against an Avalon -- since the Lincoln folks clearly didn't want to see their new Lincoln Motorcar hanging out with the riff raff.And, I do agree with a previous poster, that the Genesis certainly seems to pass the smell test insofar as it being able to pass as a premium or at least entry-level-premium, if such a thing exists. I mentioned my airline pilot friend -- a long time BMW owner/driver -- got a Genesis R Spec hot on the heels of owning a BMW 5, and he loves it. He probably doesn't count though since he usually just goes from his house to the airport long term parking and back. A 5 series probably was overkill for his twice weekly commute.In any case, I started out wondering who in the wide-wide-world of sports would pay $61K for a front-wheel-drive Acura. I don't see it. :confuse: "
"mlevine","February 2013"," I would wait to see reviews on the RLX after it is out a year before buying it. Acura's key cars hace been the TSX, TL, and its SUV's. Not sure why they are have this model in the line-up. Infiniti finally got rid of the Q45 as it did not sell, and marketed the G and M series successfully. "
"sweendogy","February 2013"," I agree one should wait on an Acura product but not due to quality but to performance because the current line (awd TL included) is a dog and has been since the tsx and TL redues - it's amazing how long they have gone without producing a solid exciting sedan- the mdx is in what it's 6th year in current form and by far it's best product- but I've been saying this for years. Yes Infiniti hit it right with the first g, the second even better- coupe convert and awd right in the form of what they are chasing - & somehow offering much more at price (dollar for dollar even the biggest BMW lover could not disagree) - they did it right lets hope the new q50 continues this but I will miss the g name. Dk much about the M or its impact- sure its a nice car but even as an Infiniti fan has it left a real mark? I don't know. "

Not sure that the current version is a ""dog"". Road and Track review of the top super handling TL has very good performance numbers and specs compared to BMW and others who have the ""magic"" RWD.. Wife and I having owned a 2001, now a 2004 and 2007, we are waiting for an ""elegantly"" styled and nicely performing next gen. Have driven the current gen as a loaner, agree with car magazine testers that steering and on-center is a problem compared to our 2004 and 2007. Will Acura have a redesigned Acura TL in 2014? Or, will it be later. "
"sweendogy","February 2013"," Well look at the sales numbers and tell me they are not a dog. I would look again, now styling asides, and terrible by most accounts, BMW audi and Infiniti (don't dk about lex) make better cars then then TL. The tsx is a nice accord alternative but not a better car for thr price. You and the wife can own as many TLs as you want but until acura makes a better TL they haven't had a good car since the previous TL (which you have oned, bravo) "
"mlevine","February 2013"," Acura seems to make good quality cars. They are solid vehicles, but honda has never been about being stylish. Initially when the M sedan came out it appears it was very popular. The recent generation M took a hit with its looks and transmission problems. "

How much could this thing possibly cost? MSRP of what, $36K to $39K? "
"flightnurse","February 2013"," NYCAR, GM has tried this many times and have failed, last time was with the G8. For this car to be successful, GM has to make sure that the car is screwed together correctly, and have a premium feel to it. The price is right thought. "
"flightnurse","February 2013"," The tsx is a nice accord alternative but not a better car for thr price. Sweeny even though the TSX is a European accord, it is not an alternative for the US accord. The US accord is more the size of the TL. "
"sweendogy","February 2013"," For the price it's an alternative, right? Same engines.

"plekto","February 2013"," The tsx is a nice accord alternative but not a better car for thr price.Sweeny even though the TSX is a European accord, it is not an alternative for the US accord. The US accord is more the size of the TL.The Accord that they sold in Japan until the model change this year was the same Accord that they sell in the rest of the world as the Accord.Except in the U.S., where they called it the Acura TSX and charged a premium for it. What we got as the Accord over here is a car that's in-between the Civic and the Accord, called the Inspire. The Accord that we get over here now is a special-built car for the U.S. market and as such it still is a kind of bastardized car that's really not the same thing that they sell in Japan.If you want the real ""Accord"", buy what they call the TSX like the rest of the world does. It's a far better vehicle than the over-sized mess that we are now getting. Personally, I'd take a CPO TSX over a new Accord. If I wanted a car that was that big and drove like the new Accord/TL, I'd buy a Buick or maybe a Toyota Avalon. "
"nyccarguy","February 2013"," I used to be as anti GM as they come. In my eyes, they've really done a complete 180 compared to the garbage they put in the showroom in the '80s, '90s, & the better part of the '00s.After 2 superb ownership experiences with BMW X5s (2004 & 2007), my Dad decided he wanted a bigger vehicle. He bought a 2010 LTZ Tahoe. After 2 years & 50,000 miles he traded it in & bought a 2011 LTZ Tahoe. After years of driving imports, my best friend bought a 2009 LTZ Tahoe & then traded it in on a 2011 Tahoe. Are they as we'll designed as the German or Japanese cars? No. GM does seem to be making great strides. Enough so that if one of their vehicles (like the SS) drives the way I like a car to drive, that I'd have no problem buying one. "
"mlevine","February 2013"," In my daily dealings I have had people like the design of the prior M generation than the current one. The same can be said of the prior QX56 and newest design. I was almost going to lease the M37, but multiple issues with the transmission shifting prompted me to stay away. I am still a fan of the M37 and compare it to the E class MB and BMW 5 series. "
"flightnurse","February 2013"," For the price it's an alternative, right? Same engines. Leather , parts., larger cheaper, newer - The TSX is smaller than the last 2 generations of Accord, I don't think its the same engine either. Price could be in line, but the people shopping an Accord were not cross shopping a TSX. Friends who bought a TSX never once went to a honda dealer and looked at an accord. http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2014-chevrolet-ss-sedan-photos-and-info-newsJust another Aussie built RWD... When Rick and I were in Australia a few years ago being car nutz, we checked out some of the Ford and GM cars, as far as overall design they are different, not just that they are RHD, they do their own thing when it comes to design. Not saying that it was right or wrong, just different The G8 was a good car, however, the dash design was not what Americans liked. Like i said, I hope GM doesn't screw this one up. "
"flightnurse","February 2013"," I like the M too, however, for the price I think a 5 series is a better car. The price for a M56 is slightly less (1,500) then a 550i. I'd take the twin turbo V8 over the INfiniti V8, and a 550i can be had with a manuel, something the infiniti lacks. The E class is not a sport sedan unless you look at the AMG model. "
"sweendogy","February 2013"," If price is inline - why would they not shop accord vs tsx? Both have a 4 and a 6 engine - both are Hondas and both can be had with leather- both are fwd. To me it doesn't make sense not to cross shop. "

"m6user","February 2013"," Because his two neighbors didn't think to do it so he extrapulates that out to the entire U.S. population and considers it fact as usual. I always look at similar models from the luxury brand versus mainstream brand. Sometimes, depending on inventory or market trends you can actually buy the luxury brand for almost the same price. Case in point was when my wife wanted a SUV and she had decided on a Pathfinder. I knew the QX4 was virtually the same thing but much nicer outfitted and was going away. We made a killer deal on the QX4 that was actually less than we could have bought the Pathfinder for. I'm sure there are plenty of people that look at loaded Camrys versus ES, or Accord vs. TSX or even TL, or Fusion vs MKZ. Sometimes you can move up to the luxury division for very little money and have a better warranty, dealer experience, etc. Obviously, this won't always work but it's worth the effort to look. Ergo.....cross shopping. "

"flightnurse","February 2013"," Because his two neighbors didn't think to do it so he extrapulates that out to the entire U.S. population and considers it fact as usual. Well lets get the facts correct, they weren't neighbors, they were friends. They are the typical US buyer, they are not car enthuses. They do not understand the differences between a pathfinder and the now defunct QX4. What I think is interesting is, how you and sweeny try and use YOUR car buying experience and say that is the norm for car buyers. Why do car magazines, only test Accords, Camry's, Altima, Malibus, Focus's and not add TSX, MKZ, ES350? "

"m6user","February 2013"," Too funny. All we are saying is that some people do crossshop like that based on our experience in response to your huge survey of a couple of friends and coming up with a definitive statement that nobody does. I don't think being an ""auto enthusiustt"" puts anyone in a special category. Even people that don't live cars have brains and can recognise value. I never even insinuated that most people crossshop those kinds of cars but I know that a lot do. It's silly to assume that just because a couple of friends don't do something that eveyone else in the country doesn't either. If you would say something like ""IMO I don't think most people shop for cars that way based on a few of friends buying habits"". Then it's clear you really don't know but you have an opnion. But, you rarely do that. You just make definitive statements based on huge assumptions.I would agree that most people probably don't crossshop that way and that is one of the reasons that the car mags test cars that are recognised to be in the same category. However, I think another big reason is that car companies don't want their cars compared to economy cars or luxury cars respectively so that is probably one of the conditions that the car companies have when loaning a car for a comparo. In fact, I just read somewhere where Lincoln wouldn't provide a MKZ because the mag wanted to use it in a comparo with some mainstream cars. I read a lot of car sites so I just can't remember where I read that recently.If you frequented a lot of the other Edmunds forums or owners forums of mainstream cars you would realize that a lot of people are comparing a Camry to ES etc. "

It's kind of silly to pretend that every buyer is the same. I know when I was looking at more compact premium sedans a number of years back, I looked at the Passat and the Audi A4. I also looked at the Accord, TL, and TSX a number of years ago. Some people who are very badge conscious won't do that. Others will not care about a badge as long as a vehicle has what they want. And what they want has a lot of variation, too. Some people look at ELLPS for the ""L""; some look more for the ""P"". Depending upon which factors are important, cross-shopping with the more ""plebian"" brands may or may not occur.What I suspect is true is that there are *fewer* people who will cross shop. But not nobody. And any of us who pretends we know that percentage is just guessing. "
"dino001","February 2013"," There may not be a large overlap in Acura vs Honda buyers, but as long as prices overlap, there will be. Some people look at what they can spend first and then they have large flexibility on what they can buy. I'm one of those. O don't look at brands, or labels, I look at what's there. When I was buying my '03 WRX, I cross shoped it with Passat wagon. According to your creed I shouldn't be allowed because they're different cars addressed to different people - I don't care. When it's time for my 328 to go, my next car may be anything between Ford Focus and 5-series. Am I allowed to shop like that? "
"kainnyc","February 2013"," I feel you and yr smart to recognize it! It's the only way for Mercedes to compete with lexus, and Acura! A Kia has way more features! "
"markcincinnati","February 2013"," Here is a perspective -- I have no proof that this is any more than an anecdote. I suspect, however, the following perspective probably is a data point, therefore of some statistical significance.For years I was a brand shopper -- the brand I chose was Audi. Even during the ""Audi years,"" I did, from time to time, shop BMW's. Even when I could see a difference in the cars, I would always factor in a characteristice ""for the money."" For some time Audi A4's or A6's offered more content for the same money or less money for similar content (compared to the BMW 3 or 5 series).Note: all but two of my cars for a period of time were obtained via a 36 month lease.When looking at cars based on lease payments, I have found -- even within the past 3 years -- that Premium cars generally have lower lease payments than their down-scale cousins and non-cousins. My assumptions why this is so have to do with residual values (which, as we know when they are high tend to reduce monthly payments) and manufacturer's ""support"" (subventing.)Additionally, there are times that the Premium cars are more sharply discounted off MSRP, which also tends to lower lease payments.If, for instance, a Honda was shopped against a ""similar"" Acura (in the eye of the beholder and for purposes of this example) the Acura typically cost ""about the same"" as the Honda -- and at times (during the calendar end of year sales season) it is possible to lease an Acura for less than a Honda.Another example, Audi vs VW -- here you'd think VW would not want Audi subvented leases to cannibalize VW sales, but, it happened/happens. Were the shopper to cross shop a VW (as an example only) Passat and compare it (based on lease payments) to an A4, it is possible (or has been in recent times) the A4 will cost about the same as the VW and the Audi will be quattro, have an 8-speed auto and be otherwise equally or better contented than the VW. I am not saying these cars are comparable, based on Car & Driver, Road & Track or Automobile magazine comparison tests. Typically the Passat will be compared to a Camry or maybe an Avalon or Maxima. Yet, if you wandered into a giant ""auto mall"" it is not beyond the pale to imagine someone standing in the Infiniti lot which is adjacent to the Nissan lot to wander over the parking lot to look at the ""fill in the blank"" and make a comparison of the cars without regard (at that moment) for ""price"" or monthly payment.I am driving a 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD Advance with two accessories on it, which pushed to pre-disounted MSRP over $47K (or maybe over $48K). Since I got a 13% discount off of MSRP on the car it was actually $100 less per month and 6 months term less than a slightly less expensive Audi A4, which is what I thought I would end up with.Normally, I would never have cross shopped the A4 with the TL (even though it is possible the car magazines might have run comparison.)But for 6-months and $100/mo more for the Audi. :surprise: The TL seemed a bargain.

"dino001","February 2013"," I see your way of buying, but it's not for me. I NEVER leased and it is not likely I will start any time soon. This may be a function of cars I have bought and continue to like. Subaru doesn't subsidize their leases much (residuals tend to be close to market value, they sometimes lower the money factor), even the 328i I bough last year (wagon) had lease with MF way too high for my taste. After I factored 15K miles/yr I need (perhaps a bit less, but not much), all the extra fees that come with the lease, lease was not even close to be considered. It was something like 5 yr. loan at below 3% or three year lease with extra fees and equivalent MF around 5% (after conversion to interest rate) - and the residual wasn't awesome, either. No can do in my book. If I were getting a sedan or coupe, sure - lower MF would compensate for higher fees. "

"m6user","February 2013"," It's not the ""typical Camry LE buyer"" that I believe is looking at an ES. It the absolutely loaded Camry V6 XLE buyer that is looking at the almost $34k MSRP. They think maybe they can get in a base ES for similar money but they would have to give up some bells and whistles like NAV, JBL etc. The base ES is $36995. So there is only a $3k difference. I don't imagine a lot of people do it but I know there are some as eveidenced just by the people that have commented here. And $20k difference is quite an exaggeration....it's $13500 diffence between the LE and the ES.

GM's solution was to reprogram the oil life sensor to be more sensitive, but it really doesn't solve the issue which is that synthetic oil is only good for twice what conventional oil is.metal3883, ""Cadillac CTS Engine Problems"" #604, 11 Dec 2012 5:17 pm32 pages long and growing.

"markcincinnati","February 2013"," My 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD Advance (whew!) is my first non-Audi since my first, a 1978 5000. Immediately prior to the Acura I had a 2009 Audi A4 2.0T Prestige with the sport package option.I may have (I do have) some issues with the Acura -- but many/most of them are of a cosmetic nature -- but, now that Acura bought new wheels for me (3 of the 19"" wheels were bent so badly that they could not be road-force balanced), I have no issues with the steering. The wide and low profile tires that were on the Audi and on this Acura can be the source of some ride stiffness, but I have no issues that I can comment on that have anything to do with the electric power steering.The TL SH-AWD Advance is very well equipped, smooth driving and riding, yet agile and nimble (due to the wheel/tire combo and the sport suspension).It does seem to be not an unreasonable imitation of an Audi S4 when one factors in the S4's $11,000 premium when similarly contented -- if you can get past the controversial styling (yes, even the toned down 2012 still has too much ""beak"" for most folks.)I will shop Acura (among others) for my next car when the lease is up on this one -- at this point, I would shop the upcoming TLX, the Infiniti Q50, the Audi A4, the BMW 3, the Cadillac ATS and CTS and probably the Volvo S60. The Acura suffers from NOT providing its owner with an experience that is not crystal-clearly differentiated from the Honda upon which it is based.Some people think that Acura's best feature is that it comes from the Honda Motors Corporation. Others, like me, wish it wasn't quite so obvious that it came from Honda's loins (so to speak.)  "
"jpp75","March 2013","  Sad that GM still has oil/engine problems on the Caddys. My uncle bought a 2002 DeVille with the dreaded Northstar.

He now drives an Infiniti and will never consider GM again, and I can't say I blame him. "
"plekto","March 2013"," The CTS doesn't have oil issues from a design standpoint. What is happening is that people need to learn that with an oil life monitor and synthetic oils, that the gauge usually will be telling you how much life/protection is left in it.If you run it down to 0%, it's not time to change it. It's that your synthetic goo has turned into water in terms of protection capability. You should never let it get even remotely close to 0%. "
"dino001","March 2013"," If 0% trully means zero protection, the designer of CTS should be fired, because it's a poorly designed messaging system. It should be such that ""zero"" means ""change now"", because that's how normal person would understand the message. I trully doubt that is how it's designed. As an engineer, I can tell you we work with factors of safety and other means to tell us that when the calculation shows an element is ""over the limit"" it does not mean ""run and hide"", it only means ""do something to improve the situation"". We NEVER design things to be on edge of destruction, whether it is a house, a bridge, or a machine. If we did, nobody would feel safe in them, as they would literally fall down somewhere, every day. Only things like spacecraft or similar ""new frontier"" items where risk calculation allows for safety factors to be cut to razor thin margins, would have ""zero life left"" mean ""tell your wife you love her"". If you are telling the truth, CTS HAS oil issues - big ones. "
"robr2","March 2013"," The CTS owner's manual for 2013 shows that when the ""Change Engine Oil"" soon comes on, it should be changed with 600 miles and that the oil showed by changed at least once a year.that the gauge usually will be telling you how much life/protection is left in it. When the oil life percentage in my Explorer gets to 0%, Ford says to change the oil within 500 miles. That indicator has a level of safety built in. "

Mostly that was true, but not always. Several people posted who seemed credible and checked their oil on a regular basis. At some point the engine started using a quart of oil every few hundred miles, and that was a disaster for the average ""set it and forget it"" driver who wouldn't know how to check or add oil to save their souls.The 3.6 engine has serious issues, possibly related to the cam drive system, but in any event the symptom is sudden onset high oil consumption followed by engine failure.

"dino001","March 2013"," Yes, they do. By law, American market cars have to have lights aiming unevenly, biased to the right. You could see it in xenons because they are so bright, but the same is with regular lights - that is, unless people tamper with their settings, which I see done a lot. Some guy thinks he can't see, so he ratchets the up, blinding everybody else.BTW, Other markets (like European) have different regulations (even aim, there are other differences, too). However, US-versions of European brands have US-market settings, obviously. "

"plekto","March 2013"," When the oil life percentage in my Explorer gets to 0%, Ford says to change the oil within 500 miles. That indicator has a level of safety built in. Evidently, in the CTS's case, 0 life was really very close to 0% and there was no leeway. GM changed it to be twice as sensitive (2011) so it tells you it's time in about 6 months or 6000 miles, which gives you a fair amount of leeway. Note - anything less than about 25% protection is running into greatly increased wear with synthetic oils. If you are running an older (2011 or older, evidently) CTS, letting it drop below 50% oil life remaining is causing increased wear and problems. I ran into this a few years ago when I was looking for a car for my parents. And back then the mechanics at the dealers were all saying to get it changed at 6 months/6K miles. (the manual says almost twice that interval) That they didn't do a recall is a whole other problem, but the mechanics certainly figured out what had happened with the oil life sensors several years ago. So the engine isn't the issue. In fact, it's the best engine GM has ever built. It, not too surprisingly, wasn't really designed to run on synthetic goo which some marketing genius managed to pass off as ""oil"". GM kind of found this out the hard way, it seems. NOTE - there is nothing that says that you can't run semi-synthetic in the car, either. In fact, the newer oil that they put in it at the dealership when you get it changed (on 2011+ models at least) is actually semi-synthetic. GM doesn't want to admit that their engines shouldn't be run on pure synthetic and are ""suggesting"" their new DEXOS standard oils. Yes, it's buried way way in the fine print, but DEXOS is semi-syntietic oil under a new brand name/standard to try to confuse the issue, since they spent over a decade ruthlessly pounding into everyone's head that pure synthetic oils were better than conventional ones.(which is not true, obviously)So the fix? Switch to semi-synthetic ASAP. Change oil every 6K miles/6 months. Ignore the computers and change the oil religiously at those intervals. Semi-synthetic costs about twice as much per change, but you change it half as often. "
"markcincinnati","March 2013"," 2012 3.7L V6 Acura engines didn't come with synthetic oil. Of course the dealer will sell it to you -- but if you don't ask you will get non-syn when the oil change indicator comes on (which is at 15%).I have used 100% synthetic oil from the first change forward. I change the oil damn near the instant the 15% indicator comes on -- and, of course, I always use a new filter. I bring my oil into the dealer, since at the beginning I didn't know if they actually even had syn oil. Are you saying that synthetic oil has a shorter (in miles or time) life span of ""protection"" but that semi-syn is better in that regard? I thought that one of the hallmarks of 100% synthetic was that it was able to hold more dirt and crud in suspension than non-synthetic oils (meaning, I assume) that you could use synthetic oil for longer intervals without engine damage or for shorter intervals for even better protection than non-synthetic oils.I've not heard the argument to use semi-syn; it seems if half synthetic is good, that full synthetic would be better still. :confuse: "
"dino001","March 2013"," Yeah, I had same thoughts. The comment on synthetic simply didn't add up to me either. Knowing that European brands/models and all other brands marketed across the Pond (that includes GM, Ford, Honda et al.) come with synthetic-only maintenance with intervals 12-20 thousand miles, depending on the brand (they did that about a bit less than 10 years ago). You have to use specific brand (or approved brands), or you void your warranty, but the idea is to cut into number of visits in garages. Seems it didn't catch up in the US because the dealers would rather see you four times per year, so they can always find something to do. In exchange, you get cheapest oil they can buy, but since you change it every three months, it doesn't matter that much (in their mind anyway). It would be an outrage if customers suddenly stopped coming just because the oil got better and doesn't need to be changed, wouldn't it? Not in this country, we don't allow things like that. Plekto's short synthetic life comment make no sense to me. Even oil companies today sell full syntetic oil with indicated intervals on the box north of 10 thousand miles. They woudn't do that, if the product didn't meet that. They have interest in selling more stuff, not less. The advantage of synthetics is supposed oil particle size and chemistry, which in turn is supposed to provide both better lubrication and lifespan. "
"ivan_99","March 2013"," I always thought synthetic was only useful for engines that 'used' it; akin to premium fuel...only engines that ran hot (turbo's, etc) benefited. The life of the oil wasn't necessarily greater.Suppose it doesn't matter...to maintain your warranty you need to use what the manufacturer specifies anyway; hopefully they get it right  "

I own my car - I do 2 oil changes a year and use a synthetic blend- no real reason why I choose it - it's cheaper then full synthetic and cost 10 bux more a change vs the regular and it makes me feel good for some odd reason- "
"stickguy","March 2013"," I would have to check the manual, but I assumed my Acura (2013 RDX with the 3.5l) used semi-syn. I know my 2007 Volvo S40 uses that (I asked when I took it in for the first time last year).but for the Acura, it will get what they put in it, since the dealer will be doing it. "
"plekto","March 2013"," Are you saying that synthetic oil has a shorter (in miles or time) life span of ""protection"" but that semi-syn is better in that regard?

No, it doesn't have a shorter life span. It's more than double, in fact. The issue is what happens when both are put under stress or are reaching the end of their lifespans.Synthetic oil is slippery goo that is only protecting the engine's internals due to the anti-wear additives that are part of it. When those run out, the goo essentially has the protection of water, or close to it. If you are near the end of its life and, say, it's a cold winter day, the synthetic has all gone down into the crankcase other than a thin film left on the internal parts. If the levels of anti-wear additives are too low, you're in trouble as there is nothing to fall back on.Natural oil has anti-wear additives as well(to help with higher rpms and pressures), but when it reaches the end of its life, the oil itself retains a fair amount of low rpm/starting anti-wear properties as long as it hasn't suffered thermal breakdown.(synthetic oils are better in this regard) In fact, oil will retain most of this natural level of protection even when it has been reduced to sludge. The reason you should run semi-synthetic, as GM is now recommending, though not openly (new Dexos standard), is because when the synthetic runs close to the end of its lifespan, there is something to fall back on. Semi-synthetic works for pretty much all engines and is incredibly resistant to abuse as well. That it's cheaper is also a huge plus.And, yes, almost all other manufacturers have their oil life sensors tweaked to be very sensitive with a massive safety margin if the car is running on pure synthetic. You'll never have an issue with a Honda because the synthetic isn't even halfway to its real end of life. (use it in a lawnmower or whatever if you drain it yourself - it'll still work for that just fine, even used) "

"plekto","March 2013"," And... nothing in that article is counter to what I was saying. :P #1 is about 3K oil changes. This is of course, about *oil*, which has a certain amount of natural lubrication ability no matter how old it gets. I use conventional oil in my ""commuter"" car (It's almost 15 years old now) and routinely run 4 or 5 thousand miles in it with no problems. My Dad's CTS is showing that it's time to change it at about 5-7 months, typically, which correlates with what the service center mechanics now recommend.Not a huge difference, well, other than price.... I sometimes get the feeling that we're getting scammed into buying new technology.#2 - #5 are common sense, IMO.#6 is absolutely correct in that you can swap right over to semi-synthetic for the extra level of protection that it affords if you forget to change the oil. Semi-synthetic is awesome stuff, IMO, that gives you the best of both worlds for hardly any more money. #7 also was touched on in my post, though indirectly. Conventional oil is not inferior to synthetic oils in normal driving conditions. The video that the article links to on this assumes that synthetic is always superior other than price, though. Most of the press also assumes this. Nearly every claim about synthetic oil being superior is based upon racing or extreme conditions, as well, where it does make a difference.If you are racing the car or are using a high revving engine (7-8k+ RPMs), there might be some added protection. But it's going to make no difference in your Jeep or Civic.http://autos.aol.com/article/gm-engine-oil/""Further, GM says that if a customer has an engine failure that is traced to oil or lubrication issues, and if the customer does not use dexos 1 oil in their gasoline-powered GM vehicle, that act alone could void the warranty.""Note - Cadillac originally mandated Mobil 1 full synthetic in the CTS. That they would change from full to a blend and make it mandatory is telling. "
"dino001","March 2013"," If you are racing the car or are using a high revving engine (7-8k+ RPMs), So if you have a new crop turbo engine (revs are 20K+), if the turbine bearings are lubricated by same motor oil, you better get a synthetic - which is a usual recommendation by manufacturers. The conventional oil could coke on those quicker than 3K miles. "
"plekto","March 2013"," Obviously. This also affected Porsche, Mazda (RX-8), the Honda S2000, and several other cars with high revving engines. Conventional oils simply couldn't take the punishment. And as engines get to be smaller and higher revving, with more turbos in the mix, you'd need a synthetic blend as a minimum.Look, synthetics are superior to conventional oils in every way but one. The base stock of both oils is not the same. While the synthetic has vastly superior properties in most aspects, it's also so highly refined that it provides little protection by itself (almost watery with no viscosity). Conventional oil does to a degree. Then they add the additives to it to make it the oil you and I buy. This isn't an issue at all until you get to a scenario where the oil gets too old. In essence, there is no failure mode for synthetics. They work perfectly until they don't and the engine blows up. So ""whatever, I'll change it in another month"" simply is asking for trouble over time. Conventional oils just sludge up and while that's a huge separate problem, your bottom end bearings usually won't grind themselves into oblivion. "

"plekto","March 2013"," Synthetic are superior on paper, BUT, that one problem is really a giant one, potentially, as it conflicts with the #1 goal of oil, which is to keep the machine from self-destructing.

"andys120","March 2013"," I spent a good deal of my adult life coming up with reasons not to buy a BMW--not worth the asking price, snotty, pretentious owners, not good in snow etc etc. I finally succumbed when I stopped by a local independent reseller/service center and saw low mileage E39 Fivers going for about the cost of a loaded CamCord. I'd driven enough Bimmers to know they were very sweet to drive and I'd known enough owners to know they were well-made so I swallowed my reservations and acquired a 44K mile 528iA. I still have it 8 years and 100K miles later and I've since bought a 77K mile 330Ci Cabrio.The real BMW enthusiasts aren't the swells running around in leased M3s, they're the guys like me running old but quite serviceable cars and enjoying them because they're well-made and great to drive in a way that your average FWD sedan could never be.

It is the order of items they decided to pay and acquire that made them paying student loans in 25 years.

"stickguy","March 2013"," just because you have some student loans doesn't mean you have to live like a pauper or drive a junker.My son is about to graduate, and will have some (but not exorbitant) student loan debt. If (please!) he gets a job soon, we will have to do something about a car, because I don't really want to send him away to depend on the well used old one if he is depending on it to commute.so, a lease may make the most sense, since there won't be any money left really to put down on something decent, and you would still need a large loan. so, the student loan will be just 1 more monthly obligation in 9 months when they start, though putting extra toward it will likely make a lot of sense, depending on the interest rate.Still, getting started in life, as long as the payments are not a problem, no reason not to live a normal life.Now, my nephew the intern, I think he has close to 300K by now piled up (200?)

If they have that kind of money to put down on a lease they could just buy a pretty good used car for that, no it won't be fancy, but it would be more financially sound, that said that certainly isn't what they have to do, and they are free to go for the fancy car if they want, it is one of the reasons we live in the area we do, people are allowed to make their own decisions, but they are also supposed to live with the consequences of those decisions, not go blaming someone else for them and ask for handouts. Anyway I am getting off topics so I am going to stop. "
"sweendogy","March 2013"," Scwman- classic responce - my rebut - evenif it's 4k down and that's an if- you get a brand new BMW (with ""free maintence"") for 3 years - and if you are a recent grad and have an entry level job- you don't have to worry about a new transsssion -'or something similar that you would get in a used car- plus you don't have to pay the full nug at pickup. - a good used car that's 5 years old depending on model is a min 10k. Lux cars could be close to 20 or more. Not saying anything wrong with a used car - but a new car under certain lease requirements and given certain situation is not a bad option- and could be a better option. Rock onI got an integra GSr in 2000 for 25O a month 1500 down- could not get a better deal- had a 3 year lease- warrantee - no issues- I was a young buck just out of college - last 3 cars have been bought new- all bought- but even if I had the money I would still finance because the rates are so low- case in point- after trade we owed less then 5k for my wife's crv- I financed for 60 mths at .9 because rate was so low- not because we didn't have the extra 5- all about what fits "

"stickguy","March 2013"," well, I used an example, but was not considering a BMW for a new grad.

"scwmcan","March 2013"," I have no problem if they can afford the payments, as I said they can do what they want, and you did bring up the BMW which is what I replied to, it would be slightly more reasonable to get a new civics or whatever, but that was not what was being discussed here, it was the leasing or purchasing an entry level luxury car right out of college. Now nobody but the actual person knows what their financial situation is so really we have no business deciding what they should be doing with their money ( as I stated in the my original reply) and the payments on the BMW may be about the same as on the civic ( though with a bigger upfront payment) so why not go for it if you can and want to, but in general it make more sense to have fewer and lower payments to get yourself out of debt before you go adding new debt, of course I agree with the size of many peoples student debt they can't put their lives on hold for twenty years, but a lot of people seem to want it all as soon as they graduate and get into further financial difficulties, I guess all I am saying is they have to make sure they can actually afford what they buy, and that they have to be aware that just because you get a job as a fresh graduate doesn't mean they are going to still have that job in a year or two ( in today's workplace there are very few guarantees) and that they also need to budget savings so they can afford to survive and continue to pay for things in the event they do lose that great first job.

"dino001","March 2013"," Those friends I had, who paid off student loans in just a few years, did not live like paupers. This forum is about ELLPS, which has word ""luxury"". Last time I checked the definition, it meant things that are not necessary in life. Last time I checked the word ""pauper"", it meant somebody deprived of the basic goods and services. There is world between those two point. A three year old domestic or imported compact car is not beyond dignity of a recent graduate. Plenty of people live like that and are not considered living like paupers.I'm not going to tell anybody how to live their life, I just rebuff claims that life without a nice car is somehow going to less fulfilling. There is no entitlement of having a nice car when one graduates from college, or medical school. Those feelings are internally developed due to social pressure and marketing. Does not mean we all have to obligue. However, if somebody considers a new Lexus or BMW more important than being debt free, it is their choice. But is was a choice, not necesity. All I ask then is that one does not say later ""it was not my fault"", ""nobody could see that coming"", or similar excuse phrase, when things don't go according to plan. "
"dino001","March 2013"," All standard leases include GAP coverage. Putting money down on a lease is a bad idea, period. It is usually based on desire to lower payment and projecting what one should do on a loan, where large downpayment is actually a good idea. The difference is in completely different type of risk in each of those financing schemes. Loan puts risk of ownership on the buyer, lease puts it on the bank. So banks will love people putting money down on a lease. "
"nyccarguy","March 2013"," Dino - I don't like to dispute what you say because you always research before you make your point (and very well I might add), but I think GAP insurance laws vary by state.

Where I live now (CT), GAP is something they push on you in the F&I office. "
"dino001","March 2013"," On the leases or loans? I never leased, but every article I read about leasing said GAP is now standard with leases. Perhaps our hosts (kyfdx) could confirm/deny this. Btw, even if I am right, it will not surprise me if some dealers double sell to uniformed. "

"dino001","March 2013"," I liked 9-2x, they were Subarus all the way, but with small value added in (available leather, HID lights, nicer wheels, all on top of the line vs. Subaru did not offer it in WRX, only STI).

The tires are crappy in snow and the throttle takes a light touch.. "
"dino001","March 2013"," I second that. I'm not objecting to people buying/leasing cars often, I actually have done that, too. I'm definintely not a 10-year holder of a purchased 3-year old car, the longest stint I have done so far was 6 years, I also owned another car until it was 8 years old (I had it for a bit more than 4 years). It is wonderful that system made it possible and convenient for somebody to drive a virtually new car all the time (and a nice one) and move from one to another in a seamless fashion, without big hassles. It is also true that some manufacturers subsidize those lease deals, which is effectively lowering their sticker prices without actually doing so. Even with all of that, constantly paying a portion of three years of depreciation (even if it is lowered by a subsidy) is more expensive than buying a car (cash or loan) and say staying just couple of years beyond the warranty expiration. The sweet spot would be eight to ten years, but even six would do for most of the situations, except extreme ones. Many say ""you can't own a car beyond warranty, it will fall apart and cost you a fortune"" I say there is no evidence of such and let an extended warranty pricing be a guide. Since that is a very profitable product (number of people get fed by just selling them), and 100K mile extension with small deductible on ELLPS will not exceed $4K (most likely it will be about three grand) adding that plus extra planned maintenance of about another 2-3 grand (also most likely less), gives us AT MOST 7 grand average price of extended ownership. In fact, majority of people will pay much less, some unlucky ones will pay more. Nobody will convince me that two times (even) subsidized three year depreciation plus interest (money factor) and fees (two acquisition fees - $1500, two disposal fees - $500-$1000) is less that one time 6-year unsubsidized depreciation plus interest, but no fees plus extra maintenance and repairs/ext. warranty. And 6-years old well maintained car is still nice enough, IMHO. The only time the lease thing MAY be a trully cheaper alternative, is when the car is simply not driven by the leasee/owner, or to be more precise, when it is one of those (sorry Nurse and Doggy) ""leader ad"" deal, when the mileage limit is something like 8-10K per year. That will change the math in lease's favor, even with fees. However, for a normal commuter living in places like mine (no real public transit, 15-20 mile one-way just to get to work), the three year lease, even heavily subsidized, is a much more expensive proposition vs. extended ownership. It offers a convenience to those who will not be able to stay with their three-year old car, but even then it can be a tossup. Hwere is an example: in late 2008 I bought the STI, which I sold in early 2012 (3 years and change). In November of 2008, Lehman Brothers just went bankrupt, nobody was buying anything, Subaru offered $2500 off price that was already 2% under invoice PLUS 0% APR financing for 63 months. Basically $36.5K (plus fees, TTR, roughly $40K total) sticker became $29K ($33 with all taxes and fees). Three years later I sold it for $22.8K, 69% of total transaction price. It just so happened that the Japanese earthquake choked the new car supply to the point that used ones had prices beyond ridiculous. The lease offered at the time of purchase was at somewhere around 50% residual, i.e. $18 grand (not subsidized, and MF and all fees were definitely NOT zero). It was just a fluke, but even if I sold/traded the STI at originally projected value of $18K, the lease MF and fees would still be far more than the financing of the loan. At that time I investigated the lease becuase I did not consider STI to be my long-term choice anyway, but even with that the purchase showed to be much better course of action. "
"graphicguy","March 2013"," ky.....how'd you do this a.m. driving around?Noticed you're looking at a ""Saaburu"".

That was on top of the $50 Mastercard I got from Ford at the Chicago Auto Show.Car companies sure like to hand out money to people who aren't in the market.Dino...while I rarely keep a car past its warranty period, I agree...today there's little reason not to. All cars are more reliable today than at any time in history. "
"kyfdx","March 2013"," Roads were just wet on the ""good"" side of the river, so no issues... Still have my snows on the BMW... It's my wife that drives the G37X and she works from home....

(but, not everyone works 24/7.. lol) "
"graphicguy","March 2013"," Good to hear everything is safe in the ""holler"". No issues up here, either.Given the dwindling market for Saabs (regardless of their origins), I'm suprised the dealer didn't offer to split the difference with you. If you get it, can't wait to hear the road story bringing it back. "
"flightnurse","March 2013"," Fed, its simple, because they want the latest and greatest, the ones who much have that are the ones who keep company's like BMW and Audi's alive. Now granted, I will be in the market for a new car soon, I'm running low on my free days from national.I plan on buying, and keeping my next car, just like I did with my 330, so I have the new 3 series wagon, with the diesel engine or the 3 series GT with the diesel engine on my radar. I don't plan on modify the car, like I did with the 330, just plan on driving it. "
"dino001","March 2013"," I don't think those are coming with diesels any time soon. Wagon will probably be only 328i/xi and GT will be 328i/xi or 335i/xi. Diesel is not even in new sedan yet, I'm not aware of plans to introduce it there, so it will take years, if at all, to make it to the wagon or GT. You can hope I'm wrong, of course. "
"dino001","March 2013"," New wagon just showed up on BMW website. Only 328 xdrive, but all four trims (modern, sport, luxury and M). Pretty high starting price ($42.4K including destination. BTW, what's up with their stupid ""starting at"" with a price without destination? How can I get one without destination? Don't you hate it when they start off with a blatant lie?). However, I'm sure when you price sedan to match wagons standard features (all wheel drive, fold down rear seat, sunroof), the differential is about 2 grand. I understand one may or may not want those, especially x-drive, but it's only fair to add to make apples to apples comparison. In ""Dino's minimum config"", i.e. red metallic, premium and lighting packages, anti-theft system, sport trim, including upgraded seats, sport transmission package (apples to apples), the price differential is about 2 grand ($49.6K wagon, $47.7K sedan). Steep, if you ask me for a (nice, admittedly) turbocharged four cylinder engine. Nice car, but no thanks for now - I stay with my E91, which cost me a few good thousands less, has extra navigation, a few more conveniences, including keyless entry, shades, homelink, parking sensors, basically another several grand of options on top of what's already high price. I can only imagine the price for 335i GT, when it comes in  . I probably will have to wait even longer, if I wanted one.I also noticed they finally made split rear folddown seat standard on 328/335. Interestingly enough, 320i does not have it standard. Talking about leader ad there... They really make it so they can advertise ""starting at"" with $299/month, or maybe even $259/m lease if you don't want leather. After loading with leather and stuff, it tops 40 thousand bucks, 45 if you really put ""everything"" on it, but not by whole lot, so there is real price separation with loaded 328i. To me, it is pointless, but I guess for those looking at white an blue propeller in front and nice handling, but not much more, they get something there. It may be even selling OK. "
"nyccarguy","March 2013"," Leasing is more expensive. I most definitely agree. In 18 months (yes math majors, for those who care I've had my 328xi for a year already), when the lease is up on my car I'm going to buy (finance). So in my case, the lease will have worked out less expensive than if I would have bought the car. There are 2011 328xis out there NOW selling for close to what my lease buyout is (in 18 months).You are right about out of warranty repairs being cheaper than buying a new car. What's the WORST case scenario with a BMW? iDrive crashes at 75K miles and needs to be replaced? What's that going to cost? $4000? So even if you have to outlay $4000, then pay for the 75K oil change, it is still cheaper than spending $50,000 on a new one. People like things shiny and new. They like to not pay for out of pocket repair costs. Most times because they live outside their means in the 1st place. "
"nyccarguy","March 2013"," Half of the fun is getting there. Literally. I actually went & drove the car for our esteemed host. My NAV routed me through beautiful, downtown Lodi, NJ. I think Lodi is Spanish for ""roll 'em up."" "
"dino001","March 2013"," Leasing is more expensive. I most definitely agree. In 18 months (yes math majors, for those who care I've had my 328xi for a year already), when the lease is up on my car I'm going to buy (finance).Wow, I'm impressed. I know I already did say ""I told you so"", so this time I'm just ""I'm glad you saw the light"". No, seriously - from what you wrote last year about your finances and preferences, I thought right away then that if you trully liked the car and it proves to be good to you, buyout will be best option. You got a great lease deal, the buyout will only take away a little bit, as you'd pay back some of that subsidy from the inflated residual. But you still keep the other discount and you still keep low finance charge. The only reason to back off is, if over those next 18 months the car developes some serious issues, and I mean serious ones, not just window motors, or hose faults. Hopefully in 18 months you won't see any issues to spook you out of it. BTW, hopefully not jinxing it, my only visit to a dealer in 19k miles/17 months was to do a basic maintenance. Not a single reliability-related issue - and why should it, really. This is advantage of buying a seasoned model, one that they worked out all the bugs before. The car has couple of annoyances, but they are due to design, not reliability. I can't stand the Point of Interest search on my Navigation. I think it's trully pathetic (categories, A-Z search, time it takes to display results, etc.) and several hundreds for an update of such a subpar system is simply ridiculous. It is 10% value and 90% brand, I'm not as inclined to pay for such mix. My ipod nano sometimes does funny things - when I turn the car off and back on, the podcasts turn into fast forward (high pitch fast speach). All I need is to reset it by switching back to music and back to the podcast again. It is annoying, but I doubts dealer would even be able to replicate the issue and if he did, he'd say it's my ipod's fault, their car is perfect - so I don't bother. What could go wrong? A lot of things, engine, transmission, electrical gremlins. All of it could be really costly, over ten grand even in really bad scenario. However, the real question is what is a chance? Small, very small in fact. Extended warranties are sold as insurances against catastrophic issues, but most of the time they serve as prepaid service for small nuisance stuff, costing less than the warranty itself. It is a peace of mind, indeed, but somewhat expensive. I'd rather buy such peace by having money in the bank and using it only when actually needed. "
"graphicguy","March 2013"," nyc....what a very nice thing to do. I had heard about the Saab/WRX, and the quest to ascertain its condition.I do remember those cars. They were Subaru WRXs with a slightly modified SAAB grill and trim (when GM had a stake in both).At one time, those cars could be had on the cheap brand new. Now, SAAB is gone and Subaru is no longer affiliated with GM.I actually thought about getting one when they were blowing them out. But, at the time, I had no need.Again, kudos to you. "
"nyccarguy","March 2013"," When I decided to get rid of my Acura, it was for absolutely no good reason other than ""I didn't LOVE it."" The crummy brakes & lifeless electric power steering had a lot to do with that, but it would have been much more financially responsible of me to have kept it. Right now I'd have less than 2 years worth of car payments left & a car with 70,000 miles that would easily surpass double that. I treated myself by leasing my BMW. Once this lease is up, I'm going to stay off the hamster wheel. I'm going to buy whatever car I decide. I've got a sort of crazy short list in my head that includes but is not limited to:Buying the lease out on my 328xiBuying a used or CPO 2011 328xi with less miles (and less equipment).Buying a CPO 335xiJeep Wrangler Unlimited (4 door, 4WD Convertible = very cool). The prices on these used are utterly ridiculous though.I'm going to set my MAX budget @ $30K. Once the lease is up on my BMW, I'll have less than 2 years left to pay off my wife's Pilot. So once the pilot is paid off, I'll be able to double up on whatever I get next & pay it off early. "

"flightnurse","March 2013"," Dino, BMW stated that the sedan and wagon will come with a 2L 180hp Turbo diesel. I'm not expecting them until the 2014 MY. You can build a wagon on BMW website currently delivery wont happen until June. in regards to the GT, I don't see why BMW wont add the diesel to it either again, I'm not expecting it until MY 2014...

"dino001","March 2013"," Fair enough. I think that's generally a good news to finally have lower power 4-cyl. diesels available, even if I don't care for them as much as the other guy. I read of 320d coming in, which finally makes much more sense than the older 335d. 335d was a rocket, but the case for diesel is in its fuel economy and car range, not in racing abilities. 180 hp diesel is definitely a better choice for the market and may even find some good following, as long as they price it correctly. It will give you a ""feel"" of 220-240 hp gasoline acceleration feel, just shorter in duration, because of rev limits. If the transmission is good, this may be a really good car. I wouldn't buy one (as long as gas stays around where it is now), but I see why somebody else would. "
"sweendogy","March 2013"," Dino was shocked at the short length of this responce- I actually got thru it thank you. Sorry about the nano, Maybe Steve jobs not happy you bought a BMW.

I thought the first Gen of iDrive was bad, this Ford system is horrible.... "
"flightnurse","March 2013"," Dino, when it comes to gas prices, talk about difference in prices. In Calif Diesel is less then Premium unleaded, and with the 30% increase in MPG of diesel over gas, people who understand this will buy them. In Phoenix, currently Diesel is less then regular unleaded, so this means the price difference between Diesel and Premium unleaded is roughly .35/gal. Now will this stay this way, who knows, but as long as Diesel's price does not exceed premium unleaded by 30% there is a savings. What is the average price of Premium unleaded (PU) and diesel in the tampa area? How much does it cost to fill the tank with PU and how much would it cost to fill with with the same amount of gallons with Diesel? I'm sure the difference isn't that much but the savings on the diesel would out weight the cost.  "

"robr2","March 2013"," My local Shell has Premium at $3.95. Diesel is $4.15. It's hard to justify the extra for diesel fuel. "
"michaellno","March 2013"," My local Shell has Premium at $3.95. Diesel is $4.15. It's hard to justify the extra for diesel fuel. Same here in Colorado - Shell has PUG at $3.75 and Diesel at $3.95. "
"dino001","March 2013"," Yeah, Florida too. Diesel almost never falls below regular, most of the time it stays either above or just below premium gasoline per gallon, probably more often above by 10-20 cents. It is not available at my Costco station, where I fuel every week (i.e. the effective differential is even higher, as Costco charges less than say Shell or BP). Considering diesel engines cost more and need more maintenance, the mpg differential needs to be really substantial to offset the fact that I don't like how it drives vs. nice smooth gas engine. At least 20% better mpg number before I even give it a time of my day. "
"michaellno","March 2013"," At least 20% better mpg number before I even give it a time of my day. I also suppose it depends on the type of driving you do and what you use your car for.My wife has been getting about 22MPG on the last few tanks now that she's been in her new job for 3 1/2 weeks. This is a 2010 Mazda CX-7 that requires premium. She likes the security of AWD here in Colorado and the hatchback capacity since she is now toting about a lot of materials for the job.About the closest diesel equivalent would be the Jetta SWG - but it doesn't offer AWD. A small or mid-sized SUV with a diesel and high 20's combined fuel economy would be just about right. 20% above 22 is 26 MPG. "
"nyccarguy","March 2013"," Diesel in NY and CT are always higher than 93 Octane by at least $.15/ gallon "
"plekto","March 2013"," I fail to see the logic, though.My local Shell has Premium at $3.95. Diesel is $4.15. It's hard to justify the extra for diesel fuel. 12,000 miles/25mpg = 480 gallons of fuel. X 3.95 = $189612,000 miles/30mpg = 400 gallons of fuel. X 4.15 = $1660That Diesel is more expensive is an illusion. The reality is it's less expensive over time. "
"robr2","March 2013"," But the upfront $3,000 premium would require almost 13 years to break even. "
"stickguy","March 2013"," NYcarguy made a good point about this. You are paying more for a better engine upgrade. Not that much different on the BMW than paying to go from a 328 to a 335 or a 6 to an 8 on a 5 series. "
"robr2","March 2013"," You are paying more for a better engine upgrade. Not that much different on the BMW than paying to go from a 328 to a 335 or a 6 to an 8 on a 5 series.But IIRC, there may be some other upgrades as well. Does upgrading to the diesel give you anything else? "
"dino001","March 2013"," Only if you consider diesel a better engine. Gas mileage is just one part. To me diesel is not a better engine for a sports sedan overall. Minivan, SUV, pickup truck, yes. Small sedan, sports sedan, convertible, coupe, no. Just an opinion, of course.On price point, $3000 price difference can be partially recouped at resale, so it may not need 13 years to pay it off. However, as I just stated, I consider diesel an inferior choice in terms of driving experience, thus it is not sufficient for me to just break even with gas. To put it simple, to even consider diesel, it would need to pay itself vs. gas in just two-three years, so after five or six I could really say it was cheaper. "
"plekto","March 2013"," You beat me to it. Diesels, especially if they somehow have a manual transmission, are absurdly high on resale value compared to their gas cousins. Case in point. I can't literally buy a working/reliable Mercedes 240 Diesel with manual for under $4K. Almost 40 years old and it's still hard as hell to find a good condition one as nobody wants to sell theirs. Recent VW TDIs are also incredibly hard to find used as people just don't sell them unless they are literally falling to pieces. "
"scwmcan","March 2013"," I'll give you the sports sedan engine, as well as sports car, but not the every day sedans, the way the majority of people drive them they wouldn't even notice the diesel engine, except for some very slight noise dig fence, in fact most would prefer the low down torque of the diesel. Even in the ports sedans, in Europe they claim the best 3 series is the 320 d with the six speed manual ( I may not agree either BTW, just stating the Euro Mag's opinion). Also so far at least part of that $3000 is extra equipment as the diesels here tend to be a higher trim level than the base car, the manufactures are not offering base level trim with the diesels ( they are doing the same so far with most hybrids as well). I think this will start changing and we will see what the true cost of the diesel option is ( though reall with direct injection, turbo gas engines seemingly becoming the norm there is not much extra on a diesel anymore beside the particle filters, and there is talk of them be required on the gas engines soon too). Also someone said that diesels require more maintenance, I am wondering where that cames from? "

Of course they are going to hold onto them - their only really choice is to go buy the same vehicle, just a few years newer. "
"graphicguy","March 2013"," Rightfully or wrongfully, diesel cars really are little more than niche vehicles here in the U.S. Not sure why, except diesel fuel, at least in OH, usually runs from 30 cents/gal more than petro....I've seen the delta go as high as 75 cents more for diesel.In short, it makes no economic sense. Diesels do offer a little more low end torque, but they also usually give up some HP and higher end revs in the process. So, I consider that a wash.Car makers try and try (mostly the Europeans) but they just won't get a foothold for all the reasons stated.For those who are fans of diesels, there are a few models to look at. I don't think they'll ever remotely be widespread, however.pletko....it's going to be hard to find any 40 year old car in great shape, not only diesel Benz's.  I don't think VW brings all that many diesels to the U.S. to begin with compared to their selection of gasoline cars that they bring here, so TDIs will be hard to find. "
"flightnurse","March 2013"," Interesting so the cost difference is only $4/tank between the two, now if you smoke or go to start buck you spend more on your vice than a tank difference. Plus you get 30% better MPG.. "
"flightnurse","March 2013"," Considering diesel engines cost more and need more maintenance, What is the price difference? .20/gallon and if your tank hold 20 gallons you are talking $4/tank difference not much of a difference. However, you get 30% better mileage.More maintenance? In which way? "
"flightnurse","March 2013"," The break even point all depends on how much you drive? When we were at the VW dealer looking at the Passt, they had a chart that showed the break even point on all their TDI. The average drive drives 15K miles a year for VW the break even point is roughly 4 years, of course the longer you hold the car the more it pays you back. For some, owning a diesel is not the best think because they do not keep their cars long enough, for me and my partner it does since we hold on to our cars longer than most. "

"dino001","March 2013"," There is an extra maintenance around emission systems due to regulations. Depending on the manufafacturer, it may amount into urea injection tank refills (Mercedes Benz), or some other emission control activities. It would be best to check with the manufaturer or dealer on the maintenance schedule. I would not believe everything dealer posts on their sales floor - or to be exact, if they say it's 4 years, it probably is 6 to 8 to break even. BTW, I don't believe modern diesels would last as much as older ones. There are already indications (in European markets) that the new crop suffers from same issues that undercut gas engine's longevity (electronics, sensitivity to fuel quality, leaks in turbos, etc.). "
"dino001","March 2013"," It still would if you got 25% gas mileage and resale value was high. If diesel gives you only 10-15% gas mileage boost, not so much. Also, some ELLPS (not many) may not require premium gas, which would make needed differential even higher. "
"albert72","March 2013"," check out this link - the new diesel engines are vastly more complicated than the old school MB diesels. Crunch the numbers, ie greater cost to buy, greater cost of fuel vs increased mpg. Also try to figure out incremental cost to maintain. Depending on how much you drive and the % of city vs highway, it could be 8 years to breakeven and in that amount of time, a lot can happen regarding fuel prices, disparity in price between gas and diesel and of course, drivetrain technology and improved mpg. http://www.myturbodiesel.com/1000q/DPF-Adblue-FAQ-VW-Audi.htm "

"leoblue","April 2013"," Hello everyone, I'm new to this forum. I'm sorry in advance if my question has been discussed before (haven't been able to go through 15000 previous posts yet, but I will). And also sorry in advance to BMW 3series fans because what I'll write may sound like I'm trashing BMW. But in fact, on the opposite, I'm looking for your help to make the case that BMW 3 is still the right car for me. That's all for the opening, here's my story:I'm having an Acura TL2004 at 125K miles. I love this car, inside out. But recently, it's been having so many problems that I decided it's time for a new car. Actually, my TL has been having quite a few problems since the warranty expired but I kept fixing it hoping that problem would be last but it's not the case...Anyway, since I'm looking for a new car, BMW 3 series is on top of my list thanks to all what I read about how great it is... a benchmark for the performance segment....So I test drove a BMW 328i xdrive and a 328i 2013 model last week, and here's my first reaction:- Interior: far worse than my TL, materials look cheap and feel cheap. The seat leatherette looks like it's not fully stretched leaving ""waves"" here and there (hope you understand this, English is not my native language). The steering wheel stitches feel rough on the hands. For me, the best phrase to describe the cabin is ""made in China"" kind of stuff (just the feeling, not fact)- Performance: trying to overcome the disappointment with the interior, I was hoping that the German approach was no nonsense and put all the money into the driving experience. However, I felt only marginally better driving dynamic and that's only achieved with Sport mode because when I started with Eco mode, I could hardly tell the improvement vs. my TL. You may say that I'm not that sophisticated a driver to really feel the difference. But the fact is that when I drove a Toyota Camry and a Nissan Maxima just a few weeks ago (rental cars), I clearly felt the difference with the Camry and Maxima feeling like it's ""floating"" on the road vs. my TL's my firmer, controlled and composed dynamic. Driving 80mph in the Camry and Maxima I didn't feel as secured as in my TL. I was hoping for that ""leap"" from the TL to the BMW 3 but it was not the case.Long story, hope I didn't bother you too much. Here are my questions:- Have someone owned both Acura TL (04-08 model) and BMW 3 series? What's your opinion about the 2 cars? - Could my limited excitement be due to the fact that the test drive was to short to really feel the difference (I was on each car (328i and 328i xdrive) for about 20 mins)? Or could it be because the TL is really good and all that driving performance superiority of BMW 3 was compared to the mainstream car like Camry so I didn't feel that much of a jump? I still really want BMW 328 to be my next car and I hope you could help me to really understand the difference. Thank you very much. "
"carnaught","April 2013"," I had an '04 TL and then an '06 and '09 325i and 328i, respectively, among many other cars. The TL drove admirably well, but not exceptionally. It felt light and much less planted and confidence-inspiring compared with the two 3-series BMW's. The Acura developed numerous squeaks and rattles and the leather seats wrinkled and showed wear. The TL was reliable but with a much more ""hollow"" feel compared to the firm and steady and rock-solid feel of the BMW's. The interiors of the BMW's, although not the best in the business, wore well and were ergonomic (I happened to like the iDrives I had in each.). While I could ride with others in the BMW for prolonged time without fatigue, for example, the passenger seat in the Acura felt compressed like sitting in a hole or on a commode.Leoblue, these are just a few observations of mine on the differences of the two cars; keep in mind that this is a very subjective thing. You have to buy with a car that appeals to you. There are many fine car choices you have and you should not go solely on other's opinions but mainly the opinion that matters the most, your own. "
"dino001","April 2013"," One thing is BMW has many options and lines. I would not even touch leatherette interior. The wood or sport line inlays look so much better than standard silver, it's not even funny. Sport and M lines have much better seats. I understand there is also different suspension on M line, not sure about sports. If you option it right, not just get some base level from the dealer's lot, the car will be different. The only true downside is the price. To get ""right"" BMW, not just the badge, you got to pay more than starting price. Worse, many dealers don't even keep good cars, not to spook buyers with 50k+ stickers. I looked my dealer's and it seems majority are basic, one two options, not even those designer lines, which trully add nice touches, for a price of course. Bottom line, if you aren't ready to pay up, you better go with Acura. The price is simply better, especially if you want to stay well below 50 grand. "
"xrunner2","April 2013"," To get ""right"" BMW, not just the badge, you got to pay more than starting price. Worse, many dealers don't even keep good cars, not to spook buyers with 50k+ stickers. R&T said this about the 3 series: ""The 3-series, which used to make so much more sense than the 1, is now a perfectly nice car that barely registers on the fun-to-drive scale."" Barely registers according to them. They also said that it focuses more on electronics than on feedback. So, all of this probably does not matter to many people who mainly buy these cars to ""show off"". To say that they have arrived. To say that they are sophisticated. "
"dino001","April 2013"," I agree. The F30 loaner I got was a real disapointment in terms of feedback. But it was larger and faster than my E91, so for some that's enough. R&T is probably excaggerating, because all others go same direction, but it may not be as far off. "
"tlong","April 2013"," Welcome to the forum Leoblue.I have an '05 TL, very similar car to yours. Fortunately for me, at 130K I've had very few problems.I also have found the BMWs underwhelming on test drives. Like you, I really like a nice interior and that's not BMW.I could suggest you check out Audi A4 or Mercedes C-class. Those cars are still taut and handle well, but would have the nicer interior that you may be looking for.Good luck! "
"graphicguy","April 2013"," With everyone else here. I'm a big fan of both Acuras and BMWs. The new edition of BMW 3s (known as F3x series) really are a significant departure from their fun to drive roots. They're still good driving cars, but to get the premium features you noticed missing, you have to option a 3 up close to $50K.I'd look very seriously at the new TLs, particularly the SH AWD versions. They are super handlers and good performers. Plus, they still have some of the best tech in the industry.The Infiniti G37x is really a particular ""buy"" right now because the new version will hit dealers in August. So, they're blowing them out.Lots of good deals on really nice cars right now. "

"leoblue","April 2013"," Thank you everyone for your advice. This weekend I continue the saga to find my next car and here's the report.Mercedes C-Class C300 4MATIC- I really like this car. It looks refined outside and elegant inside. The ride is composed though it feels heavy and a tad slow (vs. my TL. The C300 has 248hp + AWD vs. my TL 258hp, that maybe why)Infiniti G37x:- I like the G37 design but it's dated. Not much change even since the G35. And overall, I find the ""G"" styling works much better with the coupe than the sedan. Interior is decent, nothing wow but overall good impression. - Man, this car is fast. 328hr really works here. However, like many have said before, the engine is not refined.- So my overall impression with the G37s is so so... I think Infiniti know it so they throw in an outstanding lease deal right now.So at this point, I'm kind of leaning toward the C300Then the next morning, I took my TL out for an oil change. While waiting, I saw a Cadillac dealer right across the street. I hate Cadillac ""Art & science"" design language, to the point I think I'd feel embarrassed driving one. But I've been seeing and hearing enough about the new ATS that I decided to give it a try. Cadillac ATS 2.0T- First off, I think the ATS looks the best among the current Cadillacs (the new CTS looks very good too when I saw it at the NY Auto Show but it's not current yet). It looks sporty and smart. The LED arch looks better in real life than on TV. The interior looks pretty nice too with attention to details. Some negatives: the dashboard stitching is a good attempt but looks fake. The high gloss center control looks cheap. And the silver buttons line up ""Transformer"" style looks kiddy. I thought only ATS suffers from this layout (perhaps the designer tried too hard to make it look young) but surprised to find the same button line up and layout in the CTS. Too bad, without these negatives, the ATS cabin could be one of the nicest in its class. - The drive: Awesome. Wow, this is the first time that I feel the ""fun to drive"" that people have been talking about. It feels light and fast, yet composed and firm. The only car to this point that I want to keep on driving during the test drive.- After the initial excitement, I went home and did some research about the ATS, owner's review. It looks like the CUE still has a lot of problems and gas mileage is far below what Cadillac claimed. It's kind of expected for a car in its 1st year of its 1st gen. - So I think the ATS is a great car but not a car for now. Now, the remaining candidates are BMW 328i xdrive and MB C300 4MATIC. Then wife said: BMW. So BMW it will be!  "

If so, fine choice!in this group, I will say that driving them all is key. "
"graphicguy","April 2013"," lexusbuyer...based solely on your user name, I'd say your mind is alreayd made up?Gotta agree with stickguy here. All are fine cars. But, if you are looking for that isolated feel of an ES350, you'll probably be disappointed in the others you're looking at. Nothing wrong with that. It's all personal preference.I think the ES was either new for this year, or last year at the earliest.What are your priorities in what your looking for? Those might help with your decision making. And, it might help us understand which way to steer you. "
"dino001","April 2013"," Lexus ES is front wheel drive, whereas the other three are RWD-based, or AWD if you choose such. That makes a big difference in handling on ramps and corners. Lexus is Camry-based, but I would not say it's just a Camry, because that's not really fair. However, it will definitely share some characteristics with its common sister. If you are interested in feel of luxury at a great price, quite and smooth ride, especially on long trips, don't really care (or can't even understand what we are talking about) about handling, ES is absolutely perfect. I'm not mocking you or anybody else who doesn't care about handling. I know a lot of people like that and I don't think of them any less. They sit in Crown Vic or Taurus and don't miss what I would, makes them happier and that's fine. They're happy with engine pull. Again - not mocking anyone, just stating the fact. ES350 will have all luxuries (and possibly more) that you want and money still in the wallet left, great corporate reliability, plenty of clever stuff inside. I was impressed when I saw some features in my coworker' s. It's a fine car, just not for me. I like sharper steering (new BMW is already too dull for me, I like the previous models more) that RWD or AWD can offer, don't mind to pay for it with bit more road noise. I like manual transmissions, if I can have one, I'd gladly pay for it. Some ATs are really good, too, I just take MT as long as I can - just me. I can't say much about G37, other than it was developed to chase 335 buyer with lower price point or 328 buyer with same/similar price point but better performance. It is a bit ""old tech"" today, but it may be a good thing. BMW and MB need to improve gas mileage, so they go with these 4-cylinder turbos, G37 stays true to high output naturally aspirated V6 that is not very frugal, but is a rocket. They can afford it, as I believe, their mpg is averaged with parent Nissan (I don't know for sure, but why else wouldn't they come with similar engines already?). I would call it most ""old school ELLPS"" of the bunch. If I needed one today and could afford it, 335 is best FOR ME, but I have no problem with somebody saying ES350 is better FOR THEM. I can even see why and acknowledge those as valid reasons. Bottom line - it's trully matter of priorities. "
"ilexusbuyer","April 2013"," Thank you cdnpinhead, stickguy, graphicguy, dino001 for your input.So far have only driven lexus, so I still need to drive others to see what I like personally. What I wanted to get here was experiences from others. My Priorities : - Luxury - smooth and quiet driving - least maintenance cost - good mpg - roomy (would like the back seat as wide as possible for 3 to fit comfortable. Have two car seat and still have the middle person have enough room). - I really do not know more about handling besides the smooth and quiet I mentioned above. - value for money - long term (like go 200K or more without issues) - brand name Any other car that fits the criteria above besides the one I have listed? "
"graphicguy","April 2013"," Looks like a Lexus fits your bill.Maintenance costs are going to be a bit high. Have a neighbor who has two ""Lexi"". He is contstantly complaining about how high maintenance is, even for routine maintenance. Then again, someone has to pay for those oppulent showrooms.Any of these vehicles will go for 200K miles. As you're aware, strict maitenance is key, however.Value for money....hmmmm....looking at that and low maintenance desires, smooth ride, big back seat, have you looked at one of Hyundai's premium cars? The Equs or Genesis? They have great warranties. My son had an Elantra and it was uber cheap to maintain. And, it lasted him a good long while. "
"m6user","April 2013"," I think you should look at the Acura TL. It's front wheel drive like the Lexus, gets excellent MPG, rated very high reliability and low maint especially if you plan on keeping it a long time(which you indicated). The German cars will no doubt cost you more time and money after you get out of warranty time and miles. If you have to deal with snow the Lexus and TL being FWD will be a little better for traction. The Acura TL also comes in a AWD version but based on your stated use and not caring that much about the handling I wouldn't recommend it as it is heavier, get less MPG and cost several thousand more. Why pay for it if you're not really going to use it. The Germans are all RWD with AWD being optional but if you have to contend with a lot of bad weather and snow you would probably need the AWD which, again, raises the price and lowers the MPG. If it were me and I had the same buying criteria that you have, I would go with either the Lexus or the Acura. "
"ilexusbuyer","April 2013"," Thanks m6user. I did try out the Acura TL also. It did not feel as smooth as lexus and also felt a little small from inside (compared to lexus). The controls on lexus were much better also. I guess, these are the personal things one notices after the test drive. Overall, I like Acura TL also. I live in norcal with no weather/snow issues. "
"m6user","April 2013"," Yes, the Lexus is a little smoother and bigger inside as it's now based on the Avalon and not the Camry as someone else mentioned. In fact, if you're not totally immune to a Toyota versus Lexus you might take a look at the Avalon. From what I saw at the auto show and from what I've read about it, it seems to have an almost luxury class interior and the same drivetrain as the Lexus for about $5-8k less money. "
"flightnurse","April 2013"," For work I travel, and rent a lot of cars. Lately I have been renting many Buick LaCrosse's I have to say, I'm pretty impressed with them. They are comfortable, roomy, good power and get decent MPG. The price difference between a Top of the line LaCrosse and ES is about 10K, which is a lot of money. As graphic has pointed out, you are sold on the Lexi, why waste your time looking at other cars when you will have a hard time being objective looking at other cars. However, if you can be objective, the LaCrosse should be one to look at. BTW, what is your price range you want to spend? Also look at the new Toyota Avalon, again, you will save yourself about 10K. "
"nyccarguy","April 2013"," roomy (would like the back seat as wide as possible for 3 to fit comfortable. Have two car seat and still have the middle person have enough room).I think you are looking in the wrong class (size wise) of cars. Any of these will fit 2 car seats in the back, but fit a 3rd person comfortably in the back with the 2 car seats? I don't think so. Are we talking high back booster seats or 5 point harness seats that need to be LATCHed in? Have you looked at the Toyota Avalon? It is a bigger car than the ES, I think :confuse: It should get you the same comfortable ride you are looking for & that LEGENDARY Toyota reliability :P One way to reduce your maintenance costs on a Toyota or Lexus would be to pay attention when you take the car in. Don't just drop it off to the Service Advisor & say, ""the light is on, it needs service."" Usually unless it is something major, the car will most likely require a simple oil change when the light comes on. "
"dino001","April 2013"," To Lexus Buyer This forum is populated mostly by people who have quite a bit different priorities than yours. There is nothing wrong with your priorities. Somebody here mentioned Buick, which could be another good fit for you, based on your self-description. It is probably a fine car and I would not mind renting one on an business trip to some metropolitan area, or a family trip with my parents in the back seat. However, I'd definitely not buy one, even at a steep discount and would beg a rental counter guy for something different if I went on same trip alone, especially if it involved twisty hilly/mountain roads. Different strokes for different folks. Seem to me that ES is car for you, or LaCrosse/Avalon, if you want to save money. If you bought 3-series you'll likely feel ripped off, because the things it has are the ones you seem to care least about. On the other note, please notice that you came to ELLPS forum, but it seems your preferences are strongly into ELLS, ""P"" being omitted. Buick, Lexus or Avalon have all good strong engines and good straight line accelerations, but that's not enough to be ""P"". It's the control and responsiveness aspect, usually a result of a trade with size and comfort. So if you go back into the discussion and see so many people loving 3-series, just know that they don't love it because it is roomy, quiet, or comfortable. It is none of these things in comparison with mentioned Buick or Lexus. "
"ilexusbuyer","April 2013"," Thanks for your insight dino001. You are right, I think I am not really looking for the ""P"". I will test drive the other cars and see what I feel. "
"fedlawman","April 2013"," All the other cars on your list are going to be too ""sporty"" for you I suspect.

"stickguy","April 2013"," the Infiniti would be out anyway due to MPG, smoothness, and back seat. And no way are you getting that much space out of the 3 series.The Lexus I believe is a bit roomier than the others. Not sure if big enough. Avalon, probably a fine choice, if you can live with the plebeian badge!Getting into a MB E class or a BMW 5 series is going to really up the ante.the Buick, could be a fine option.

Want a little higher brand name like Lexus. Cannot afford the E class or 5 series. Would have loved them. I really appreciate all the feedback from all of you. Very good points and educational. "
"mvs1","April 2013"," Between my wife and I we've owned/leased each of these vehicles over the past say ten years and add to this an Audi A4 and Lexus RX. I'd like to share my opinion on what you have posted, but do encourage you to drive everything you're interested in. Car buying...test driving is fun and vehicles are expensive, so enjoy picking out what you like.Many of the important items you'll get with any of the cars you've listed. As some others have pointed out I think the back seat may pose the biggest challenge. I think the ES or even the A4 might serve best in this area. Since low maintenance cost over 200k miles is important, personally I'd flunk the German brands out. On both my ES and RX, I just did routine services over both vehicles with each exceeding 150k miles, so my experience with Lexus regarding low cost maintenance was great. However BMW and Audi with Audi care provide free scheduled maintenance over 50k miles. However over 200k I'd expect service to cost more on these models.Your quiet and smooth to drive speaks Lexus as well. My wife complains my BMW is a harsh ride since I have a sport package and low profile tires. Speaking of the BMW, I have a 335. This car and the 328 are very different vehicles to drive, so drive them both to experience the difference. Both are much more focused on sporty vs. luxury.Based on what you've listed, I actually think the Lexus RX would get you everything you want but the mileage since its an SUV....and no longer a performance luxury sedan, however I wouldn't consider the ES (which the RX is based off of) one either.

"carnaught","April 2013"," The ES has much more backseat legroom than the A4. In a nutshell, BMW compared to Lexus is much more fun to drive than ride in. Vice versa for the Lexus. "

"dino001","April 2013"," added more luxury and charge 10-15K more for the same car and people run to the dealership in droves... It is a very smug thing to say, especially the way you expressed it. It is not ""the same car"". There is no Toyota version of IS, GS or LS sedans. Yes, ES and SUVs from Lexus have their Toyota's counterparts, but again, it's not fair to say they are ""same cars, just charged 10K more"". I read, or heard somewhere that even chassis are significantly different in terms of fabrication (e.g. significantly more welds). I suspect the difference between same-platform Toyota and Lexus is no less than say between Audi A3/A4 and VW GTI/Passat. Actually, I think 3-series and 5-series are much more similar than Avalon and ES. They share a lot of components, both inside and out, yet nobody would even think of saying ""people run to dealerships and buy same 3-series for 10 grand more"". It is simply unfair and demeaning to say something like that. There is a lot of dumb people around, but making such statement is to simply say every Lexus buyer must be a stooge, because he/she could get same thing for 10 grand less. I disagree.I'm not a nameplate guy myself, so I don't really support the LexusBuyer's sentiment. I would be more than happy to switch back to a Hyundai if a particular model met all my equipment and driving experience criteria and did not feel like I have to explain it to anybody. I bought what I bought because all other similar vehicles (Audi A4 wagon, Subaru Legacy GT Wagon, etc.) were discontinued by the manufacturers and before they were, they didn't even have manual transmissions anyway. I like the nameplate (everybody does), but for the right amount of money, I would easily let it go and keep the change. However, I would never say that Lexus/Infiniti/Audi buyer does not get additional benefit over Toyota/Nissan/VW buyer - and it is not just espresso machine in the dealership. There are tangible differences between those. It is matter for discussion if they are worth the premium charged, but just to say that people pay 10 grand for (presumably) nothing is wrong. "
"ilexusbuyer","April 2013"," Have you looked at the price for Avalon recently flightnurse? If I go for the limited Avalon XLE with technology package, it is the same price as Lexus ES350 with luxury package. If I do not go with the limited Avalon, it is around 4 - 5K less. So there is no 10 - 15K difference. So lets not just use generic statements and be factual. The prestige badge does matter to me, but up to a certain price. "
"flightnurse","April 2013"," It is a very smug thing to say, especially the way you expressed it. It is not ""the same car"". There is no Toyota version of IS, GS or LS sedans.

"flightnurse","April 2013"," The Avalon is a bigger car, so if you want the room in the back seats, this is the car to go with. I have never been a big fan of Lexus, most of the Lexus line is a tart up Toyota, The ES was a Camry, the LX and GS are 4 runner and a Land Cruiser. So if you want a Lexus, go buy one... If you want a bigger car with more rear room, buy a Avalon and save yourself roughly 2K, since the Lexus dealer doesn't normally make deals on their carsBTW, the last generation ES was a tart up Camry which was 10-15K less then a ES. "
"flightnurse","April 2013"," Yes, it does. I did test drive the lexus and it fit the two booster seat and still comfortable for the third person in the middle. How big was this third person? A small child, or a very small frame adult? "

"dino001","April 2013"," BTW, the last generation ES was a tart up Camry which was 10-15K less then a ES. Well, apples to apples? Top of the line Camry was just about entry for ES, except perhaps Nav, which I'm not sure if it was standard on ES then. TOL Camry was/is over 30K, ES was starting at mid 30s. I think apples-to-apples, the ""brand"" difference, if you will, was more like 5 grand, no more. And that bought you a few things, from superior upholstery, to better frame fabrication, to some more clever features standard on ES and not even available on Camry. It's not just that ES interior looked better, it had more good stuff in it. My coworker has one so I can see how much good stuff it had. Not sure if Camry did, even at TOL.What would likely increase the price difference is amount of discount you could get on Camry vs. ES then. It's probably similar on Avalon/ES today, but I don't know that for sure, as this is part of the market unknown to me. "
"flightnurse","April 2013"," The only car that I ever liked of the Lexus line was the original SC300/400, which by the way was a Toyota in Japan called the Soarer. So for the most part, Lexus had and in some ways still uses tart up Toyota's and sell them for huge profits. Now, my statement was it wrong, or was it the ""attitude"" behind that pushed people the wrong way? "
"flightnurse","April 2013"," Yes, Dino the prices you have are right and the last 5 generation of the ES was built from the Camry Chassis. This current generation is built of the Toyota Avalon. So, which one got the better deal, the Avalon or the ES? "
"dino001","April 2013"," Dino, give me examples of these tangible differences?Audi and Lexus get superior interior, both in design and in fit/finish. From leather quality, to stitches, to seat profile, to dashboard and liner plastics/inlays. There are options or configurations simply not available in common brand siblings:- rear wheel drive sedans (Infiniti, Lexus);- manual transmissions on big engines (Infiniti, previous generations of Audi);- actual build quality (chassis stiffness, number of welds, stricter quality control procedures, etc.);- suspension settings, both standard and sports versions of the brands;- ""same"" engines are often tuned up to produce better power/torque (not all, of course, not always enough to actually notice);- there is usually at least one generation of lag in availability of certain convenience, performance or safety equipment, whether standard, or optional (e.g. HID adaptive lights, keyelss sensor entry/start and more) for those who desire them, of course.I do not know if the price difference is fully justified to cover it, but it is ridiculous to say they are ""the same cars"". Similar would be a proper operative word. It is fair to say that 20 years ago those cars were much closer to each other than today - or so it seemed to me. "
"dino001","April 2013"," Can't tell, never looked at them. I suspect Avalon is better per pound or cubic foot, but ES is likely nicer and probably will have some unique touches. Not sure, if that's enough and what is the real price difference for ""equivalent"" configurations. "
"tlong","April 2013"," The only car that I ever liked of the Lexus line was the original SC300/400, which by the way was a Toyota in Japan called the Soarer. So for the most part, Lexus had and in some ways still uses tart up Toyota's and sell them for huge profits. Of course everybody does the same thing. It's a market segmentation ploy, no more, no less. GM with it's rebadges, and now its divisions, has done it worse than most. What is different division cars in one country (TSX) is in a single division in another (Euro Accord). It's more or less because often engines or quality of interior is changed, even if mostly the same vehicle. And of course higher-end dealers often give more perks and services. Warranties may vary. Etc. Only the buyer can decide if it is worth it to them. "
"andres3","April 2013"," The Azera is comparable to an ES. and quite roomy. Though of course, without the prestige badge! And without the track record of reliability that Lexus has proven year in and year out. "
"andres3","April 2013"," I can vouch that the GTI and A3 are indeed, vastly different cars, despite being similar. No one that has driven an A3 for an extended period of time would say the upgrades are not worth it vs. the GTI. "

Well, for one, if you look in CR you'll see way more red dots than black dots for Audi, and about the opposite for VW.

"graphicguy","April 2013"," I remember a point in time that buying a Lexus....any Lexus...meant MSRP only. When the IS first came out, I was mildly interested in one. Aside from them being relatively underpowered, they handled decently. And, they certainly had the interior ""eye candy"" appeal.I recall walking into the showroom to eyeball a particularly pretty dark grey metallic one that was sitting there. Salesperson approached, asked if I liked it. I told him I didn't know much about them. I remember him clearly....""let's go familiarize you with it.""He pulled it out of the showroom and off we went. Again, it wasn't very fast (especially given that it was supposed to be a sports sedan), but it showed quality and smoothness I had never experienced before.I had the inevitable question....""so, on this particular model, is there a price in mind you'd like to throw out there?""He pointed to the sticker.I countered...""so, if I said I was interested right now for....say....&1,000 off MSRP, you wouldn't take it?""""NOPE""!""$500 off?""""NOPE""$100 off?""NOPE""Contrast that to a year or so ago. I found an IS 350 (next gen from the one I had test driven years ago) that I was very mildly interested in. Went for a test drive again (same dealer, different sales person). Some of the same impressions I had originally...high quality, very smooth. But, this one had some ""oooomph"" under the hood.Still, it really wasn't my cup of tea.Big difference, the sales person threw out a number without me even asking that was almost $2K off MSRP.Gotta admit, Lexus makes some very high quality cars. They seem to just miss the mark compared to others I might be in the market for at any given time. "
"jeffm5","April 2013"," Don't you get a better warranty with a Lexus? Also the dealer here provides a loaner anytime the car is in for repairs. You don't get that with an Avalon. "
"dino001","April 2013"," I initially thought BMW will bring 320d. It is actually bringing 328d, which I suspect will have higher/similar torque to 328i, nominally lower power (as all diesels do due to lower revs). They announce 45 mpg highway. Say it's true. Let's also assume it will be priced between 328i and 335i, so starting MSRP in low-mid 40s ($43K-$45K) sprinting to $50K with just leather and couple of conveniences. Price difference about 3-5 grand with 328 and about 10+ with 320i (which is also stripped vs. 328i, not just engine). Taking them at face value we get 45 mpg highway vs 33 mpg (AT), good difference. I would caution excuberrance, as I have seen in the past other manufacturers promising outlandish values on their diesels in preanouncements to end up as much as 10 mpg lower after EPA tests (that was the case with new VW diesel). So let's assume 15 thousand miles per year, five years of ownership, 75K miles. Lets assume MSRP of $45K (328i) vs $48K (328d), i.e. we have some options, all miles are highway (for simplicity) - we get:1. 328i: 2272 gallons of premium at say $3.75/gal (number vary) = $8522 for five years.2. 328d: 1705 gallons of diesel at say $3.90/gal (number vary) = $6647 for five yearsAmount saved: $1874. Anticipated new car price difference: $3-$5K. The only other variable is depreciation. Say we get 5% better depreciation of 328d, say 55% vs. 60% of depreciation $26.4K vs. $27K. In conclusion, not including higher taxes and financing (loan, lease), assuming MSRP as benchmark, 328d comes up overall $2500-$3000 less expensive over 5 years. To me it's nothing, especially because:1. 328i will likely enjoy better discount at purchase than 328d2. If leased, 328i will likely enjoy better money factor than 328d; lower residual may offset that.3. People who keep their cars less than 5 years will see even smaller fuel savings.4. Diesel prices are even more volataile than gasoline. It is easy to imagine increase of the difference in price per gallon by another 10 or 15 cents.There are a lot of other factors that could make the calculus more attractive for the diesel, but there are many other factors that could offset that, too. This was intented to be a demonstration how I would make a calculation if I had all the data, including mixed mileage, trying to take emotion out and account for all variables, not just one that is visible (mpg). I completely understand the gas mileage focus. It is easy to let go and forget about the costs that are already ""set"", like car payments. They are planned and accounted in home budget, out of sight, out of mind. But the gas bill comes every week or so, varies, even though it is planned, it springs up all the time and every unplanned trip adds to the bill. So it is easy to think that if I save on gas, I will spend less money overall. But that may or may not be true. Without a cold meticulous calculation there is no way to tell. Yet people rush to ""do something"" in every time gas price jumps 30 cents. "

"cdnpinhead","April 2013"," I initially thought BMW will bring 320d. It is actually bringing 328d. . .I've been anxiously awaiting the introduction of a BMW diesel that was more representative of what's on offer in the rest of the world. This is a start, but it only comes with an automatic transmission, according to the on-line Roundel piece I read a few days ago.All I want is a small diesel in a well-made car with a manual transmission.Or, as Charles Shultz put it, I could flap my arms and fly to the moon. "
"ivan_99","April 2013"," All I want is a small diesel in a well-made car with a manual transmission.A colleague recently purchased a Passat TDI manual and loves it...or a Mazda 6? Not in BMW league but I'd still classify as well-made. "
"dino001","April 2013"," Beware what you wish for. I love manual transmissions, all but one car I have had were MT, but IMHO if there is a case of AT, it is small diesel engine. MT is least suitable for small diesel engines. Short rev range of the engine turns the driving into constant shifting for shifting's sake. Unlike modern gasoline engine (which is very flexible in both low and high rev range), diesel engine makes it really miserable on driver to be in a wrong gear. It either shakes the car violently (too high gear for the revs) or drops the torque of the cliff making passing or merging really scary if you need to execute 2-second gear upshift in the middle of the maneuver. On to of that, in city driving you feel you end up shifing up and down on 5-10 mph speed differentials, so you don't those low vibrations from the engine compartment. How do I know all of that? I drove similarly sized and powered A4 and Peugeout 406, both with manual transmissions. Both of those were considered one of the best diesel engines of their generations.Multigear automatic (like 8-speed) is absolutely transmission of choice for a diesel. IMHO, of course. "
"alltorque","April 2013"," I drove similarly sized and powered A4 and Peugeout 406, both with manual transmissions. Both of those were considered on of best diesel engines of their generations. Agree with all of that although small diesels can be OK with an MT. Torque comes in very low down so they'll happily pull you up a cliff in what your mind tells you is too high a gear. ATs are better though. I have a Volvo S60 D5 (185) Geartronic. Nice combination.I had 2x Peugeot 406's. Probably the best riding cars I've ever had. That was when Peugeot made great chassis/suspension set-ups. No more, it seems.  That Pug diesel and the VW Group 1.9 TDi PD engines are the stuff of legend and probably did more to move Europe to small diesels than any other. The 130bhp 1.9 TDi PD in my old Skoda Fabia vRS was a brilliant combination in a light car, and the 6MT was just built for playing with the mountain of torque the engine produced. Happy days.  "
"flightnurse","April 2013"," Dino, the engine in the 328d is a 2 liter 180hp, 280 lbs, BMW was going to call it 320d, but changed it to 328d. The car will only come with the 8 spd auto, which will work very well with the engine. BMW has been VERY tight lipped about the MPG of the car, however, many have guessed that mid 40's is doable on the highway, and mid 30's in town. This engine will go in the Wagon as well as the X3. Road and Track has driven the car and they were impressed, it was a short drive, I'm sure a full report will be out soon.The only way to make up the price difference is to hold on to the car and drive the wheels off it. Currently diesel in phoenix is .40 cents less than premium. Do I expect it to stay like this, no, but the price fluxuates enough that it doesn't bother me. I have owned three diesel cars/trucks in my past 1986 MB SDL, and 1981 Chevy Suburban diesel and 1996 ram truck 2500 with the cummins diesel.. Both cars were driven well into the 200K miles range the truck 175K before it was sold.. The modern diesels have taken care of the short comings of those diesels. Diesel's are not for everybody, just like Lexus, BMW and Audi's are not for everybody. "
"dino001","April 2013"," 180 hp for diesel is a lot. I think calling it 328d is appropriate here, as the 280 lb-ft torque is even larger than 328i (much shorter though, of course). IMHO the renaming to 328d is also a tell regarding the expected price. If past history is to guide us, it is reasonable to expect price differential similar to that between E90-based 335d and 335i. The 45 mpg is now mentioned on their website. I remain slightly skeptical, but if BMW learned VW lesson, perhaps it will be more accurate. VW made a huge blunder preanouncing in big letters over 50 mpg on the new Jetta and delivering nowhere near that number after EPA testing. I was joking that they must have mixed up kilometers per imperial gallon with mpg. It wasn't that bad, but the blunder was obvious. The embarrasment was so big that VW challenged their users to a survey on real life numbers. Talking spin doctors - Joe from Ohio says he got 56 mpg, so should you!I also heard that EPA mpg number is based not just on real testing, but also on extrapolation calculations based on that testing. It is basically is a good predictor for traditional gas engines, but it reportedly completely breaks down on hybrids (overestimates mpg) and has some significant flaws on diesels (presumable underestimates). I don't know if that is really true, but it would make sense why some hybrids are so off when it comes to the mileage. Many immediately smelled big conspiracies and foul play, but to me a botched methodology due to using calculations outside of their intended class of problem (happens all the time in engineering), seem much more reasonable explanation for the blunder. I simply don't think Toyota, Ford, or Honda were purposly misleading consumers. They simply run tests and calcs according to EPA guidelines, but those turned to be wrong for new technology. I agree with your last statement - diesels are not for everybody. They definitely have their place in personal vehicle market (e.g. taxi cabs, SUVs, pickup trucks), especially for those traveling often large distances at constant speeds. American aversion was a bit overdone. However, they are not cure for cancer, either. I wonder how much more 328d will cost. If they misprice it, they may kill it before it shows up. "

"flightnurse","April 2013"," Dino when it comes to MPG the diesel engine will make more MPG as the engine get miles. In regards to the VW, when new the Golf, Jetta and other VW cars with the TDI get good miles when new, however, the more miles on the engine the better the MPG, on the Diesel forum people post their real world MPG and it is amazing to see the difference. I'm thinking the same will be said with the 328d, put 10-15K on the engine and a true mid 40s on the highway would be doable. The true value of the diesel is not to own it for 3 years (lease) and then turn it in, but to own it for 10 yrs. In regards to price, I would assume base would be around 38-40K. It will be interesting to see where MB will price the C class diesel and GLK diesel. AS well as the Audi A4 Diesel, and from what I read the Audi TDI will have more HP 180hp and 240lbs...

My point is that I don't need 2 cars that'll fit all 5 of us.Like dino001 said, so many times we say we need cars for that ""what if"" that comes along once or twice a year. "
"dino001","April 2013"," Howa about 328 wagon? it is just about to be released. Same driving experience as sedan (I know, I have one previous gen, there is no difference from sedan), same legroom, but better access to back seat and more back headroom than sedan. Since your passengers are kids, not adults, legroom is not as critical, but improved access maj just do the trick. And you get extra cargo space for kids' stuff. If you wait another six months, there will be 328/335 GT, more legroom in the back, better access.Think about it - if the car is really for you and only sometimes for the kids, 328 wagon could really be for you. "
"stickguy","April 2013"," the one thing that the wagon won't have happens to be the key issue. Back seat width. "
"ilexusbuyer","April 2013"," I understand what you are saying, but my ""what if"" happens everyday. I prefer to use the van on long drives or when there is lot of cargo to hold. On regular basis I would like to use the sedan. "
"stickguy","April 2013"," someone over on the Accord thread just posted about how much they love their new Accord V6, and compared it to an ES. Pretty much all the features, and 12K less. and a big back seat. "
"nyccarguy","April 2013"," Understood "
"nyccarguy","April 2013"," I don't know if I told you or not Dino, but they had an F3X 328i wagon at the ny auto show in (I think) deep sea blue, & it was drop dead gorgeous. By far my favorite looker of the F30 line.  "
"graphicguy","April 2013"," ilexus....thanks for sharing your impressions.first time BMW drivers usually have the same impression as you.Do yourself a favor and test drive an Audi A4 and an Acura TL, too. "
"ivan_99","April 2013"," Since your passengers are kids, not adults, legroom is not as criticalI find the opposite...when kids are sitting in a forward facing seat (booster, etc) their little feet stick straight out...marking up the previously beautiful seat backs. Maybe not legroom...but seat depth would help...or really really short seats so their legs could bend  "
"dino001","April 2013"," Yeah, it does look nice on pictures. Deep sea blue is also color of my E91 (BTW, the new one has letter code F31). Funny it was my third choice (crimson red was first, le mans blue was second, but neither was available, as they discountinued red for that last year and le mans blue required M-package, well over 1 grand extra, which I did not order). Yet, when I saw it on the platform in Munich and ever since, I thought it can't be better. The only true downside of it, it is a dust magnet, especially in the back. Just like black, if not more. My previous red STI and blue WRX did not require as much cosmetic attention, as this one. "
"dino001","April 2013"," Did not think of that, you make sense. So it seems for kids out of the booster seat the backseat space is not an issue, but yeah, I see your point on the real young ones. "
"dino001","April 2013"," Didn't Accord just get smaller in this generation?BTW, it must be top of the line, because that rental from Hertz I drove (I was surprised myself that Honda sold a rental car) was unimpressive to say it charitably. "
"andres3","April 2013"," What he means is a car is not its options that come standard. A car is the chassis, suspension, interior and exterior materials and finishes, engineering, design, looks, handling, power, performance, Gas mileage, and refinement. Some people buy bells, whistles, gadgets, and doo-dads. Some people buy the car. I'm in the latter group. After all, I got an Audi with just 2 options, DSG transmission, and Sport Package (admittedly that includes like 3 or 4 things).You can add a million gadgets and options to a cheap car, it's still a cheap car with a lot of content.
